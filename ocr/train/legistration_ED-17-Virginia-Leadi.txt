Executive Directive Number Seventeen (2021)

Virginia Leading by Example to Restore the Chesapeake Bay and Its Tributaries

Importance of the Initiative

Overwhelming scientific evidence shows us that nutrient and sediment pollution degrade
water quality and harm living resources. The Commonwealth of Virginia has pursued and
achieved significant reductions in nutrient and sediment pollution to the Chesapeake Bay and the
rivers and streams that are tributaries to the Bay. Despite real progress, continued reductions in
nutrient and sediment pollution are necessary both to restore the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem and
to meet federal Clean Water Act requirements.

A restored Chesapeake Bay will make Virginia a more desirable place to live, work, and
play. It will enhance our state and local economies by supporting tourism, outdoor recreation,
fisheries, aquaculture, and other sustainable, water-oriented economic development. Restoration
work also creates jobs, improves land management, and benefits local communities by making
them more attractive and resilient places to live.

In order to meet our commitment to restoring the Bay, the Commonwealth developed a
Phase HI Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) to achieve the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum
Daily Load no later than 2025 while also accounting for the additional pollution loads resulting
from climate change. The WIP calls for additional actions to reduce nutrient and sediment
pollution by local governments, homeowners, wastewater treatment facilities, developers and
farmers. State agencies and public institutions of higher education that own land in the
Commonwealth’s Chesapeake Bay watershed must also take action to reduce nutrient and
sediment pollution. The Commonwealth therefore committed in the Phase III WIP to develop a
watershed implementation plan specific to state lands.

State Lands Watershed Implementation Plan

The goal of the State Lands Watershed Implementation Plan (SWIP) is to achieve
significant reductions in, or to offset, unregulated, nonpoint source nutrient and sediment
pollution originating from the lands and activities of all Virginia agencies, public institutions of
higher education, and other state governmental entities that own or manage land within
Virginia’s Chesapeake Bay watershed.

----$$$$----$$$$----
The SWIP required development of a comprehensive dataset of acreage of state lands
within the Chesapeake Bay watershed and calculation of pollution load reductions using the
Chesapeake Bay Watershed model. The SWIP details reduction targets of 122,000 pounds of
nitrogen and 10,100 pounds of phosphorus.

To achieve the reduction targets, the SWIP describes 11 programmatic actions:

Standards for Sustainable Agriculture and Forestry

Converting Managed Turf to Native Landscapes

Unregulated Stormwater Runoff from Impervious Surfaces on Developed Land
Native Habitat Valuation for Human Health, Wildlife, and Water Quality
Onsite Sewer Systems

Pilot Fee-for-Documented-Performance Projects

Community Outreach and Education

Aligning Habitat Restoration, Resilience, and Water Quality Goals

Build Water Quality Improvements into Virginia’s Hazard Mitigation Plan
10. Interagency Technical Support and Collaboration

11. Clean Water Jobs Training Collaborative

The SWIP also identifies specific pollutant load reducing practices, treatments, and
technologies to be implemented between 2021 and 2025 in order to achieve nitrogen,
phosphorus, and sediment reduction targets by major river basins.

Directive

Accordingly, by virtue of the authority vested in me as the Chief Executive by Article V
of the Constitution of Virginia and under the laws of the Commonwealth, I hereby order the
Secretary of Natural Resources in partnership with the Secretary of Administration, Secretary of
Public Safety and Homeland Security, and the Conservation Cabinet to ensure that the SWIP is
fully implemented by all Virginia executive branch agencies, public institutions of higher
education, and other state governmental entities that own or manage land within Virginia’s
Chesapeake Bay watershed.

Effective Date of the Executive Directive

This Executive Directive shall be effective upon its signing and shall remain in full force
and effect until amended or rescinded by further executive directive.

Given under my hand and under the Seal of the Commonwealth of Virginia this 3rd day
of June, 2021.
