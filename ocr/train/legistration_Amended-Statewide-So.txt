employee should practice social distancing (by maintaining consistent six-foot distance

condition. For purposes of this order, “emergency medical condition” 1s defined as a medical
condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain,
psychiatric disturbances, and/or symptoms of substance abuse) such that the absence of
immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected by a person’s licensed medical
provider to result in placing the health of the person in serious jeopardy or causing serious
impairment to bodily functions or serious dysfunction of bodily organs.

b. Dental, medical, or surgical procedures necessary to avoid serious harm from an
underlying condition or disease, or necessary as part of a patient’s ongoing and active treatment.

pick-up of food.
C. Hospital food service areas are excluded from this order provided they have their

own social distancing plan.

9. If organizers or sponsors of otherwise suspended events desire, they may submit a
request for an exemption from this order. While the State Health Officer is under no obligation
to grant such an exemption, it shall be fairly considered based on the following criteria:

a. Effective measures have been taken to identify those attending the event who may
potentially be affected with COVID-19, including but not limited to personal testing for the
disease or submission of current medical clearances to the organizer.

b. Effective measures have been taken to prevent the spread of infection even by
those that are infected while not symptomatic, including the provision of anti-infection measures
such as proper face masks, personal sanitation measures, and other measures that may be
considered proper.

The State Health Officer’s discretion under this section includes the discretion to refer
exemption requests from Jefferson and Mobile Counties to the respective County Health Officer
for those counties for evaluation as described above.

10. This Order shall remain in full force and effect until 5:00 P.M. on April 17, 2020.
Prior to 5:00 P.M. on April 17, 2020, a determination shall be made whether to extend this
Order—or, if circumstances permit, to relax this Order.

----$$$$----$$$$----
11. This Order supersedes and preempts all orders previously issued by the State Health
Officer and Jefferson and Mobile County Health Officers concerning COVID-19 mitigation
measures. After the date this amended order is issued, the Jefferson and Mobile County Health
Officers are authorized, after approval by the State Health Officer, to implement more stringent
measures as local circumstances require.

Done on this 27" day of March, 2020.
