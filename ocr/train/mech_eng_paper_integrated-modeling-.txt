The grinding process is a typical complex nonlinear multivariable process with strongly coupling and large time delays. Based on
the data-driven modeling theory, the integrated modeling and intelligent control method of grinding process is carried out in the
paper, which includes the soft-sensor model of economic and technique indexes, the optimized set-point model utilizing case-based
reasoning, and the self-tuning PID decoupling controller. For forecasting the key technology indicators (grinding granularity and
mill discharge rate of grinding process), an adaptive soft-sensor modeling method based on wavelet neural network optimized
by the improved shuffled frog leaping algorithm (ISFLA) is proposed. Then, a set point optimization control strategy of grinding
process based on case-based reasoning (CBR) method is adopted to obtain the optimized velocity set-point of ore feed and pump
water feed in the grinding process controlled loops. Finally, a self-tuning PID decoupling controller optimized is used to control the
grinding process. Simulation results and industrial application experiments clearly show the feasibility and effectiveness of control

methods and satisfy the real-time control requirements of the grinding process.

1. Introduction

Grinding process has complex production technique and
many influencing factors, such as the characteristics of the ore
fed into the circuit (ore hardness, particle size distribution,
mineral composition, or flow velocity), the flow velocity of
water fed into the loops, and the changes of the cyclone feed
ore. Grinding process is a serious nonlinear, strong coupling,
and large time delay industrial production process. Obtaining
the optimal control results by the traditional control method
is difficult. Scholars at home and abroad have carried out
many advanced control strategies for the grinding process,
such as fuzzy control [1-3], neural network control [4],
soft sensor modeling [5-8], and other advanced control
technology [9-12]. Reference [3] proposed a multivariable
fuzzy supervisory control method composed by the fuzzy
supervisor, loop precedent set-point model, and the particle
size soft-sensor model. Reference [4] studied the grinding
process with non-linear, multivariable, time varying parame-
ters, boundary conditions, and fluctuations complex features

and proposed an integrated intelligent model for dynamic
simulating, of the grinding and classification process.
Because of the limitations of the industrial field condi-
tions and a lack of mature detectors, the internal parameters
(particle size and grinding mills discharging rate) of the
grinding process is difficult to obtain the real-time quality
closed-loop control directly. The soft-sensing technology
can effectively solve the predictive problem of the online
measurement of the quality indices. Therefore, the soft-
sensor model according to the auxiliary variables can be set
up in order to achieve the particle size and grinding mills
discharging rate for the real-time forecasting and monitoring,
which has great significance on improving the grinding
process stability and energy conservation. Domestic scholars
have proposed many soft-sensor models, such as neural
network model [5-7] and the case-based reasoning technol-
ogy [8]. Combining the actual working conditions of the
grinding classification process of [5] proposed a RBFNN-
based particle size soft-sensor model. Reference [6] intro-
duced a grinding size neural network soft-sensor model and

adopts the real-coded genetic algorithm for training multi-
layer neural network. Reference [7] put forward a multiple
neural network soft sensor model of the grinding roughness
on the basis that multiple models can improve the overall
prediction accuracy and robustness. Reference [8] adopted
the case-based reasoning (CBR) technology for predicting the
key process indices of the grinding process. These algorithms
do not effectively settle off the online correction of the soft-
sensor model.

Aiming at the grinding industrial process, the integrated
automation control system is proposed, which includes the
economic and technical indices soft sensor model, the set-
point optimized model based on the case-based reasoning
method, and the self-tuning PID decoupling controller.
Simulation and experimental results show the feasibility and
effectiveness of the proposed control method for meeting the
real-time control requirements of the grinding production
process. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
intelligent control strategy of grinding process is introduced.
An adaptive soft-sensor modeling of grinding process based
on SFLA-WNN is presented in Section 3. In Section 4, the
optimized set-point model utilizing case-based reasoning
is summarized. In Section 5, the design of self-tuning PID
decoupling controller of grinding process is introduced in
detail. Finally, the conclusion illustrates the last part.

2. Intelligent Control Strategy of
Grinding Process

2.1. Technique Flowchart of Grinding Process. Grinding pro-
cess is the sequel of the ore crushing process, whose purpose
is to produce useful components of the ore to reach all or most
of the monomer separation, while avoiding excessive wear
phenomenon and achieving the particle size requirements

for sorting operations. A typical grinding and classification
process is shown in Figure 1.

Grinding process is a complex controlled object. There are
many factors to influence this process, such as the milling
discharge ratio Y,, milling granularity Y,, the milling ore
feed velocity U, and the pump water feed velocity U,, water
amount of ore feed A, new ore feed B, suboverflow concen-
tration C, milling current D, and classifier current E. V, and
V, represent the sand return and water resupply.

2.2. Intelligent Control Strategy of Grinding Process. The block
diagram of the data-driven integrated modeling and intel-
ligent control strategy of the grinding process is shown in
Figure 2 [11].

The integrated modeling and intelligent control system
of grinding process includes the adaptive wavelet neural net-
work soft-sensor model of economic and technique indexes,
the optimized set-point model utilizing case-based reasoning
technology, and the self-tuning PID decoupling controller
based on the ISFLA. Firstly, the milling granularity and
the discharge ratio predicted by the soft-sensor model are
named as the input parameters of the set-point model. Then,
through the case-based reasoning, the milling ore feed ratio
and the water feed velocity of the pump pool are optimized.
Finally, the self-tuning PID decoupling controller is adopted
to achieve the optimized control on the milling discharge
ratio and milling granularity ultimately.

posed wavelet neural network soft-sensor model optimized

ore feed, C is the concentration of sub-overflow, D is the
milling current and E is the grading machine power. For the
key process indicators of grinding process (feedback grinding
granularity and the discharge rate), the two multi-input
single-output wavelet neural network soft-sensor model is set
up. (1) Input variables are A, B, C, D, E, and the previous
moment of grinding granularity. Grinding granularity is

output for the feedback. (2) Input variables are A, B, C, D,
E, and the previous moment milling discharge ratio. The
discharge ratio is output for the feedback. The differences
between the predictive values and the actual values are used to
optimize the parameters of wavelet neural network through
the improved shuffled frog leaping algorithm.

Considering a multi-input single-output (MISO) system,
the training sample set can be expressed as D = {Y,X; |
i= 1,2,...,m}.Y is the output variable. X,; represents the ith
input vector and can be expressed as X; = [x1;,X>;...-»X,,]'
(n is the number of samples in the training, set and m is the
number of input variables). Soft-sensing modeling requires
a datum set from the normal conditions as the modeling
data. Assume that the system has m process variable and
n data vectors composing the test sample datum matrix
X ¢€ R”" In order to avoid the different dimensions of
the process variables affecting the results and obtain the
easy mathematical treatment, it is necessary to normalize the
datum. Set y is the mean vector of X, and o is the standard
deviation vector of X. So, the normalized process variable is
expressed as follows:

The input vector X of the training samples is fed into
the wavelet neural network to predict the output Y. The root

3.2. Wavelet Neural Network. Wavelet neural network (WNN)
is similar to BP neural network with the same topology, which
adopts the wavelet base function as the transfer function of
hidden layer nodes [14]. Its structure is shown in Figure 4.

In Figure 4, x,,x,...,x, is the input parameters of
the wavelet neural network, Y,, Y>,...,Y,, is the prediction
output of the wavelet neural network, and w;; and wz, are the
weights of the wavelet neural network. When the input signal
sequence is x; (i = 1,2,...,k), the output of the hidden layer
is calculated as follows:

a Ww;,x; — 5;
h(j) =h, ——— , j=1,2...4 ©)
j

where h(j) is the jth node output of the hidden layer, w;, is the
connection weights between input layers and hidden layers,
b; is the translation factor of the wavelet base function h,, a; is
the stretching factor of the wavelet basis function h,, and h, is
the wavelet function. The morlet wavelet function is adopted
in this paper, which is represented as follows:

y = cos (1.75x) ee 2, (4)

The parameters of output layers of the wavelet neural
network are calculated as

l
y(k)=Ywh@, k=1,2,...d, (5)
i=1

where w,, is weight for the hidden layer to output layer, h(i)
is the ith output in the hidden layer, / is the number of

the hidden layer nodes, and d is the number of the input layer
nodes.

Standard wavelet neural network uses the gradient de-
scent method to train the structural parameters. But the
inherent characteristics of gradient descent method make
the WNN training process convergence slow, easy to fall
into local minimum, and easily lead to oscillation effect [15].
Therefore, the paper adopts the improved shuffled frog-leap
algorithm to train WNN.

3.3. Improved Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm. Shuffled frog
leap algorithm [16] (SFLA) is a population-based heuristic
cooperative swarm intelligent search algorithm. SFLA adopts
the metaheuristic algorithm based on swarm intelligence
to solve the combinatorial optimization problems, which
is based on the meme evolution of the individuals in the
population and global information exchange of the memes.
SFLA combines the advantages of the genetic-based memetic
algorithm (MA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) with
foraging behaviors of the population, such as simple concept,
few parameters, quick calculation speed, global optimization
capability, easy to implement features [17]. SFLA has been
successfully applied in many fields, such as water network
optimization problems [16], placement sequence optimiza-
tion [18, 19], flow shop scheduling problem [20], clustering
[21], and so forth.

SFLA is an evolutionary computation algorithm combin-
ing deterministic method and stochastic method. Determin-
istic algorithm can make effective use of strategic information
to guide the search response and the random element to
ensure the flexibility and robustness of the algorithm search-
ing patterns. The SFLA is described in detail as follows. First,
an initial population of N frogs P = {X,,X,,...,Xy} is
created randomly. For S-dimensional problems (S variables),
the position of a frog i in the search space is represented as
X; = [Xj Xj25---» Xj]. After the initial population is created,
the individuals are sorted in a descending order according to
their fitness. Then, the entire population is divided into m
memeplexes, each containing n frogs (ie., N = m xn), in

----$$$$----$$$$----

FiGurRE 5: Frog leaping rules.

such a way that the first frog belongs to the first memeplex,
the second frog goes to the second memeplexe, the mth frog
goes to the mth memeplex, and the (m + 1)th frog goes back
to the first memeplex, so forth. Let M* is the set of frogs in
the kth memeplex, this dividing process can be described by
the following expression:

In each memeplex, the frogs with the best fitness and
worst fitness are identified as X, and X,,. The frog with the
global best fitness in the population is identified as X ,. Then,
the local searching is carried out in each memeplex; that
is to say, the worst frog X,, leaps towards the best frog X,
according to the original frog leaping rules (shown in the
Figure 5(a)) described as follows:

D=r-(X,(t)-X, (),
(7)

Xi), (t) =X, ()+D, (ID <D

max) >

where r is a random number between 0 and 1 and D,,,,, is the
maximum allowed change of frog’s position in one jump. If
the new frog X", is better than the original frog X,,, it replaces
the worst frog. Otherwise, X;, is replaced by X g and the local
search is carried out again according to formula (7). If no
improvement is achieved in this case, the worst frog is deleted
and a new frog is randomly generated to replace the worst
frog X,,,. The local search continues for a predefined number
of memetic evolutionary steps L,,,, within each memeplex,
and then the whole population is mixed together in the
shuffling process. The local evolution and global shuffling
continue until convergence iteration number G,,,,, arrives.

3.4. Improved Frog Leaping Rule. During the natural memetic
evolution of the frogs, the worse frog is affected by the better
frog to leap for the better one in order to get more food.
According to the above description of the initial frog leaping
rule (shown in the Figure 5(a)), the likely position of the
worst frog is limited to the line segment between the current
value and the position of the best frog. So this frog-leaping
rule limits the search scope of memetic evolution which not
only reduces the convergence velocity but also easily leads to
the premature convergence. A modified shuffled frog leaping

algorithm [22] based on a new frog leaping rule (shown in
Figure 5(b)) can be expressed as follows:

D=r-c-(X,-X,)+W,

en)
W = [7 Wy max? 1) W> max? re) TsWs max | ?
(xX, +D. if IDI < Dinars
xX = D ; (9)
° | Xo + Draw if IDL > Dro

where r is arandom number of [0, 10], c isa constant of [1, 2],
r, (1 < i < S) is a random number of [—1, 1], and w;,,..
(1 < i < S) is the maximum perceptual and the movement
uncertainty of the ith search space.

This frog leaping rule increases the algorithm search
scope in a certain degree. Combined with the characteristics
of SFLA, the paper puts forward a new frog leaping rule

(shown in the Figure 5(c)) described as follows:

X, =Xp)t+1r,° Fmaxl!’>
(10)
D=r,-(X,-X,),

where @ is a random angle of [0, 360°], 7... is the maximum
local search radius, r, and r, are random numbers of [0, 1],
and r,,,; defines the maximum perceptual surrounding the
local optimization value of the frog memetic groups. 0, r,, and
r, decide the uncertainty of frog leaping. The position vector

is still updated by using formula (9).

3.5. Algorithm Procedure of Optimization of WNN Soft-Sensor
Model Based on ISFLA. Two wavelet neural network soft-
sensor models optimized by the improved SFLA are set up
in the paper for predicting the grinding granularity and
grinding discharge ratio. The algorithm procedure of ISFLA-
based WNN soft-sensor model is shown in Figure 6.

Combined with the proposed new frog leaping rule, the
algorithmic procedure of the ISFLA-based wavelet neural
network training is described as follows.

Step 1 (initialize the SFLA parameters). Initialize the frog
population size N, the search space dimension S, the number
of meme groups is m (each meme group contains n frogs)
(N = m xn), the allowed frog leaping maximum step D,,,,;5

the local search number L,,,,, and the global hybrid iteration
number G,,,,,, and maximum local search radius r,,,.

Step 2 (frog population creation). Randomly initial the pop-
ulation of N frogs P = {X,(t),...,X;,(t),...,Xy()} (k =
1,...,.N). Set the iteration counter t = 0. Each frog X;(¢) is
set as the structure parameters of the wavelet neural network
soft-sensor model (wavelet stretch factor a,, translation factor
b,, and the network connection weights w,, and w;,,i =
1,...,k, j = 1,...,1 k = 1,...,d). Then, the training
sample datum is fed into the wavelet neural network to
carry out the precedent calculation according to the formula
(3)-(5). Each individual’s fitness value F,(t) = F(X;,(¢)) is
calculated according to the formula (2) after the simulation.
Finally, the frogs are sorted in a descending order according
to their fitness. The outcome is stored with the style U,(t) =
{X;.(t), F.(t)}. The global best frog in the frog population is
identified as X ght) = U,(t).

Step 3 (memeplex creation). The U is divided into the m
memeplex Y(t), Y,(t),...,Y,,(t) G = 1...,m) according
to formula (6). Each memeplex includes n frogs. The frogs
with the best fitness and worst fitness in the memeplex are

identified as X}(t) and X/(t).

Step 4 (memeplex evolution). The frog in the memeplex Y(t)
(j = 1,...,m) is assigned a probability value P;, = 2(n +
1 — k)/(n(n + 1)), (k = 1,...,n). Set the random value r €
[Pj1,Pj,]. If Pi, <r, the kth frog in the jth memeplex evolves
in accordance with formula (10), and the objective function
value of the new frog is calculated. If P;, > r, the evolution
will be given up.

If the frog doesn't achieve the meme evolution, X jolt) is
substituted by X(t) to carry out the local search again. If no
improvement is achieved, a new frog is created randomly to

substitute the x! (t).

Step 5 (local depth search). The frog in the meme group Y; (t)
(j = 1,...,m) carries out Step 4 for i times to get the meme
group Y,(t)’, Y,(t)’,..., Y,,(t)’.

Step 6 (memeplex shuffled). The frogs in the iterated meme-
plex Y, (t)’, Y, (t)’,..., Y,, (t)’ are mixed together in the shuf-
fling process and identified as ({ + 1) = {Y, (t)', Y,(), beey
Y,, (t)'t. In U(t + 1), the frog in the objective function value
according to ascending sort will be recorded as the best group
of frogs X g(t +1)=U,(t +1).

Step 7 (test the algorithm termination conditon). t = t + 1; if
t < Gyax» go to Step 3. Otherwise output the best frog.

3.6. Adaptive Revision of Soft-Sensor Model Based on Model
Migration Method. The model migration method [23, 24]
based on process similarity is shown in the Figure 7, which is
based on the well-established model to develop a new model
of the similar process by adopting few datum.

Due to the fluctuations in ore grade and other working
conditions of the grinding process, the current soft-sensor
results are no longer accurate so that the soft-sensor model
must be adaptive corrected. At the moment, a small amount
of datum may be adopted to set up a new soft-sensor
model based on the model migration (linear correction and
planning) from the original soft-sensor model to be adapted
to the new working conditions. In this paper, the migration
modeling method based on the input-output correction
programming method is adopted, whose basic principle is
shown in Figure 8.

Assume the original soft-sensor model:

Yoase — f (Xpase) > (11)

where Xpas¢ and Yj,,.- are the input and output of the original
model.

Figure 8: IOSBC migration modeling principles chart.

Through the output space migration and plan a new
model is obtained as follows

Ynew = Sof (S_X new + B;) + Bo; (12)

where S, and By is the scale factor and offset parameters of
output space in the original model.

Then, the input space is shifted and revised. The input
X new Of the new model can be obtained by the input bias cor-
rection of the original model input X,,,., which is described
as follows

Xpase = S7X pew + By, (13)

where S, and B; are the scale factor and offset parameters of
the input space, respectively.

Therefore, the new model is obtained by the input-output
offset correction of the original model, which is described as
follows:

Ynew = Sof (S_X new + B;) + Bp. (14)

Min J (So, Bo, S;, By) = ee*

where y; is the ith observation data of the new process, ¢€
represents the prediction error between the measurement
and the prediction value of the new model. The dimension
of the identified amendments and planning parameters is
determined by the input-output space dimension.

3.7, Simulation Results. Aiming at the grinding and classifi-
cation process, the grinding granularity and grinding dis-
charge ratio soft-sensor model is set up based on the wavelet
neural network. Firstly, the input-output data set is shown in
Table 1 in order to train and test the ISFLA-based WNN soft-
sensor model. The precedent 260 group data comes from the
same working condition. The later 40 group data comes from
another dynamic working condition due to the variation of
the ore feed grade in order to verify the adaptive performance
of the oft-sensor model. The first 200-group data was used to
train the wavelet neural network by the ISFLA and gradient
descent method. The later 100-group data was adopted to
carry out the soft-sensor model validation. The predictive
results of the validation data by the proposed soft-sensor
model illustrated in Figures 9 and 10.

Usually the average relative variance (ARV) [1] is adopted
to measure the difference between the predicted value and the
measured value, which is defined as follows:

N \ aeay72
ARV = Diet [x ) eT (16)
die x @) — x ()]

where N is the number of comparative data, x(i) is the
measurement value, x is the average of the measurement
values, and xX(i) is the predictive value. Obviously, the smaller
the average relative variance, the better the predictive per-
formance. ARV = 0 means that the model has an ideal
prediction. ARV = 1 indicates that the model only obtains
the average prediction results. The contrast results of the AVR
values under the WNN soft-sensor model and the ISFLA-
based WNN soft-sensor model are listed in Table 2.

As seen from Figures 9 and 10 and Table 2, the WNN
adaptive soft-sensor model optimized by the improved shuf-
fled frog-leaping algorithm (ISFLA) of the grinding process

for predicting the key technique indicators (grinding gran-
ularity and milling discharging ratio) has higher prediction
accuracy and generalization ability than those of the standard
wavelet neural network soft-sensor model. The proposed
ISFLA can effectively adjust the structure parameters of
the WNN soft-sensor model. On the other hand, when
the working condition of the grinding process changes, the
soft-sensor model can be corrected adaptively based on the
model migration strategy, which results in the more accurate
predictions.

4. Set-Point Optimization of Grinding Process
Based on Case Reasoning

4.1. Basic Flowchart of Case-Based Reasoning. The general
procedure of the case-based reasoning process includes

retrieve-reuse-revise-retain. In the CBR process, the case re-
trieval is the core of CBR technology, which directly deter-
mines the speed and accuracy of decision making. The basic
procedure of the case-based reasoning technology [25, 26] is
shown in Figure 11.

The case-based reasoning process is mainly divided into
four basic steps [27]: (1) case retrieval: by a series of searching
and similarity calculation, the most similar case with the
current problem is found in the case database. (2) Case reuse:
compare the differences between the source case and the
target case. The solution case recognized by the user will be
submitted to the user, and the effect of its application will
be observed. (3) Case revision: the solution strategy of the
retrieval case is adjusted by combining the effect of case reuse
and the current issue in order to fit the current problem. (4)
Case storage: the current issue is resolved and stored in the
case database for the future use.

4.2. Set-Point Optimization Strategy of Grinding Process.
Grinding process is a complex nonlinear industrial controlled
object. Combining the real problems that exist in grinding
process control with the theory of case-based reasoning,
the basic procedure of the set point optimization strategy is
shown in Figure 12 [25]. By carrying out a comprehensive

analysis and case-based reasoning for the complex process,
the intelligent set-point of the grinding feed ratio and pump
water supply ratio are obtained in an optimized manner.

The basic procedure is described as follows. Firstly, the
working conditions, the process indicators, and the process
datum are dealt with for the case reasoning. Then, the case
retrieval and case matching are carried out for obtaining the
matched case. If the matched case is not obtained, the new
case will appear and be studied and stored into the database.
Thirdly, the matched case will be reused and corrected.
Finally, maintain the case database, output the results, and
store the datum.

4.3. Case Description. The most commonly used knowledge
representation methods have production rules, semantic
networks, frames, decision trees, predicate logic and fuzzy
relations, and so forth. In theory, the form that knowledge is
represented by in the case is not a new knowledge represen-
tation method, but it is an abstract knowledge representation

based on the past ones, which means that the case is a
logical concept. The case must be based on the existing
variety knowledge representation methods. ‘That is to say that
almost all the existing knowledge representation methods can
be used as the implementation of the case representation.
A typical case generating process is essentially refinement
process of case databases. It represents a large number of
similar cases and experiences in common and can reduce not
only the retrieval process in the selected set of objects but also
other parts of the analog process the workload.

The case model in the CBR process is described as
C, = [T,, F,. J.J. C, means there are k cases in total, k =
(1,2,...,n). T;. represents the time at which the case occurs.
F. = (fir fopo---> fs) expresses the characteristics of what
C, describes. f;, is the working conditions of industrial
process, f,, is the process indicators, f,, is the grinding
ore feed ratio, f, is the pump water feed velocity, and f5;
denotes the feedback amount. J, = (j,; jy,..-, j,,) expresses
the characteristics solutions of the case C,.

4.4. Case Retrieval and Matching. Case matching and case
retrieval are important steps in the case-based reasoning
process and the key of the information extraction from the
case databases. In general, the case matching strategy includes
the serial and parallel search methods. In the serial search
process, the cases are organized with the hierarchical manner.
The top-down refinement layer by layer retrieval approach is
adopted, which means the more down the layer, the higher
the similarity. The parallel searching strategy weakens the
level features among the cases. The retrieve method is to
return to the most similar case by retrieving many cases. The
commonly used search strategies have nearest neighbor strat-
egy, inductive reasoning strategy, and knowledge guidance
strategy.

If the current working condition is N, the similarity
degree between the description features f; (i = 1,...,n) of
N, and the description features f,, of the case is described as
follows:

| fi = Sis
sim (fn fy) = \o ote a7)

The similarity function between N and C, is described as
follows:

n

sim (N,C,) = YG,

i=]

sim (fis fix)» (18)

where ¢; is the feature weight.
So the static similarity threshold adopted in the paper is
described as follows:

xX i> = xX 1
sim, _ | kj SIM max kj (19)
where X;; is 0.9 and sim,, is similarity threshold.

4.5. Case Reuse. In the actual production process, because
the case library does not have a case fully matching with
the current work under normal circumstances, the retrieved
solution parameters matching the working conditions are
not directly selected as the control parameters of the current
conditions. Therefore, the similar case solution retrieved
must be reused. That is to say that the CBR system will
adjust the retrieved case solution according to the specific
circumstances of the new case to get the solution of the input
new case. The adjustment strategy uses the existing process
knowledge to obtain the current working parameters based
on the differences between the input case working conditions
and the retrieval case working conditions. The SSTD-based
case reuse strategy is described as follows:

Q', (siMnax = 1) V (sim, = siMpax) ;
AY,

i , Other,
> sim

(20)

where sim, is the similarity property value of the case and Q’
is the solution of the maximum sim,,,,-

4.6. Case Correction. In order to prove the effectiveness of
case reuse, the case must be amended in the new implemen-
tation process in order to form the effective feedback. Usually
the case model obtained by the case-based reasoning can
be directly applied to the current working conditions. How-
ever, due to some differences between the current working
conditions and the retrieved cases in some characteristics,
the retrieved cases cannot be directly used in the current
conditions. The retrieved case must be amended to adapt to
the current issue.

The main contents of the case correction mainly include
the amendments of the case features and structures. If
siMpax < E; E; is identified by the experts, the case C,’ =
[T;,', F;', Jz] is added into the new case database in order to
make the case database be constantly updated.

4.7. Case Maintenance. Case storage strategy is to store the
new cases and their solutions into case database according
to a certain strategy. The case storage is the base of the
case library. By doing so, the case database keeps growing
and expanding to increase the searching scope of the case
database. At the same time, the maintenance of case database
has become an essential work. In the case of storage, the new
case C, = [T.,F,, J, very similar to the case in the database,
that is to say the similarity is 1, is not stored. This is to simplify
the case database and reduce the maintenance time.

5. PID Decoupling Controller Based on ISFLA

The paper mainly studies the relationship between the input
variables (grinding ore feed ratio and pump water feed
velocity) and output variables (grinding granularity and
grinding discharge ratio). Through experiments, the dynamic
process model of the grinding circuit includes the ball milling
mechanistic model, based on material balance, the empirical
model of hydrocyclones, the pump pool hybrid model based
on the mechanistic model and empirical model. Through the
step response of the grinding process, the system transfer
function model [22] is described in formula (21):

~0.425e'°*5 0.1052 (47.15 + 1)
P| = 11.7s+1 115s+1 fy. (21)
V2 2.977 1.063e°~""* Uy
5.5st+1 2.5s+1

The mathematical model of the grinding process de-
scribed in formula (21) is decoupled by the diagonal matrix
decoupling method. The two control variables are the grind-
ing ore feed ratio U, and pump water feed velocity U,. The two
controlled variables are the overflow mass fraction Y, and the
grinding discharge ratio Y,. The structure of the parameters
self-tuning multivariable PID decoupling controller opti-
mized by the ISFLA is shown in Figure 13 [28], which is
composed of PID controller and decoupling compensator
based on diagonal decoupling method. The parameters of the
PID controller are optimized by the improved shuffled frog
leaping algorithm.

5.1. Diagonal Matrix Decoupling. Diagonal matrix decou-
pling procedure is described as follows [29]:

Dy, (s) Wa; (s) + Da; (s) Wy, (s) = 0.

Additionally, M., #0 and M,., #0. The system may be
achieved by decoupling. By using the diagonal matrix

decoupling strategy to obtain the two single-input single-
output (SISO) systems,

Y:\(Wi, 90 \_(U;
Y,/\ 0 Wy) \U;z
must be satisfied.

For meeting W,, = W,, = 0, the system must satisfy

So obtain two SISO systems: Y; = W,,U, and Y, =
W;,U,. By decoupling, two separate single-input single-
output channels are created to make the direct control of the
milling ore feed ratio to milling discharge ratio and the pump
water feed velocity to the grinding granularity.

5.2. PID Controller Optimization Based on ISFLA. PID con-
trol is a regulator based on the linear combination of

the proportion, differential, and integral of the bias, whose
transfer function is described as follows [30]:

u(t) =K, few te [ew dt + tate 2] (29)

0 dt
where K; = K,/T;, Kg = K,Tq, and e(t) are the feedback bias.
Firstly, the Z-N method is adopted to determine the
initial parameters of PID controller. So the two groups of
PID controller parameters (K,, K;, and Ky) are (6, 35, and
0.1) and (4, 23.2, and 1), respectively. Then with the PID
controller parameters achieved by Z-N method as the center,
the searching space of the PID parameters is expanded, which
is described as follows:

(l-a)K, <K,<(1+)K,,

(l-a)K; < K;<(1+a@)K;, (30)

(l—a)K< Ky, <(1+«a)K},.

Four performance indicators IAE, ITAE, ISE, and ITSE
are described in (31). The best performance index is selected
through simulation comparison to determine the PID param-
eters. The target of selecting the performance index is to

----$$$$----$$$$----

obtain the best control performance, such as increasing
response speed, decreasing overshoot of the PID controller,
and so forth

J, = IAE = | le (t)| dt,
0

J, = ITAE = [Hew dt,
a (31)
J; = ISE= | e(t) dt,
0

J, = ITSE = | te(t)dt.
0

The original two-input-two-output (TITO) system is
decoupled into two independent single-input-single-output
(SISO) channels by adopting diagonal matrix decoupling
methods. The parameters of the PID controller are optimized
by the proposed ISFLA.

5.3. Simulation Research and Industrial Application Exper-
iments. The simulation parameters are selected as follows:
frog population size N = 50, search space dimension S = 3,
the number of memeplex m = 5, the number of frogs in each
memeplex n = 10, the allowed leaping maximum distance
Dinax = 9-01, the number of local search L,,,, = 10, and
overall hybrid iteration number G,,,, = 100. Aiming at two
SISO models (denoted as M1 and M2) described in Formula
(27)-(28), the parameters of the PID controller are tuned by
the ZN method and ISFLA under four fitness functions (ISE,
IAE, ITAE, and ISTE). By comparing the simulation results
under four different fitness functions, the optimization effects
can be obtained. The output response curves of M1 and M2
are shown in Figures 14 and 15.

For model M1 and M2, the parameters of the PID con-
troller tuned by a variety of methods are shown in Tables 3
and 4. The performance indexes of the step response, such
as overshoot, rise time, and settling time, are adopted to
carry out comparison with the different PID controllers,
which are illustrated in Tables 5 and 6. As seen from the
above simulation results, the PID controllers optimized by
the ISFLA under four fitness functions (ISE, IAE, ITAE, and
ISTE) achieve better performances than the conventional ZN
method, while the PID controller under the fitness function
ITAE obtains more superior performances.

Under the premise that the other process variables remain
unchanged, the grinding ore feed ratio and pump water
feed velocity before and after optimization have a different
influence on the performance indexes of the grinding pro-
cess. Because the ultimate impact factors on the economic
efficiency of grinding process are the concentrate grade and
tailings grade. So the industrial application experiments are
carried out under the proposed data-driven integrated mod-
eling and intelligent control method in the grinding process.
The technique indexes controlled scopes are described as
follows. Concentrate grade J and tailings grade W are 66% <
J < 71.5% and W < 28%, respectively. The target is to
increase the concentrate grade and reduce the tailing grade as

can directly determine the effect of optimized controller,

As seen from Figures 16 and 17, the performances under
the intelligent optimized controller are better than those
under the conventional controller, such as the lower fluctuate
of the concentrate grade and the higher concentrate grade,
which indicates that the proposed data-driven integrated
modeling and intelligent control strategy helps to increase
the product quality. As seen from Figures 18 and 19, the
performances under the intelligent optimized controller are
better than those under the conventional controller, such
as the lower fluctuate of the tailings grade and the lower
tailings grade, which indicates that the proposed data-driven
integrated modeling and intelligent control strategy helps to
increase the resources utilization rate.

6. Conclusions

For the grinding process, a complex industrial controlled
object, an integrated automation, and control system are
researched in detail, which includes the economic and tech-
nical indicators of soft-sensor model, the set-point optimized
model based on the case-based reasoning methods, and
the self-tuning PID decoupling controller. Simulation and
industrial experimental results show that the proposed data-
driven integrated modeling and intelligent control methods
have a better feasibility and effectiveness to meet the real-time
control requirements of the grinding production process.
