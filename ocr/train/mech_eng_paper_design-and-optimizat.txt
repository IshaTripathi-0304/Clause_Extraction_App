Abstract

Upper stage solid rocket motors (SRMS) for launch vehicles require a highly efficient propulsion system. Grain design proves
to be vital in terms of minimizing inert mass by adopting a high volumetric efficiency with minimum possible sliver. In this arti-
cle, a methodology has been presented for designing three-dimensional (3D) grain configuration of radial slot for upper stage
solid rocket motors. The design process involves parametric modeling of the geometry in computer aided design (CAD) software
through dynamic variables that define the complex configuration. Grain burn back is achieved by making new surfaces at each
web increment and calculating geometrical properties at each step. Geometrical calculations are based on volume and
change-in-volume calculations. Equilibrium pressure method is used to calculate the internal ballistics. Genetic algorithm (GA) has
been used as the optimizer because of its robustness and efficient capacity to explore the design space for global optimum solu-
tion and eliminate the requirement of an initial guess. Average thrust maximization under design constraints is the objective function.

1. Introduction

Grain design is to evolve burning surface area and
develop the relationship with web burnt. Grain design
proves to be vital in terms of minimizing inert mass by
adopting a high volumetric efficiency with minimum
possible sliver. Three-dimensional (3D) grains are
complex in shape; hence their design methodology is
also complicated. Different methods have been used to
calculate the geometrical properties of grain burn back
analysis ''*!, Analytical methods, though accurate but
limited to specific geometries, have been used scarcely
for 3D grain configurations.

The most prominent analytical method is the gen-
eralized coordinate grain calculation method which
uses basic geometrical shapes to define the initial
grain void**!, This method has long been used in in-
dustry for grain design, though it is complex and may
have small errors. The calculation step size for burn
back analysis could prove to be critical and leads to
oscillation in the burning area calculations. Ref.[6]
presented an improved approach for removing pulsat-
ing errors in grain design due to the web and axial in-
crements. Refined numerical approach still encounters

considerable errors. In these conventional methods, the
accuracy of solution largely depends upon the web and
axial increment chosen for volume calculation, and
will indeed require certain approximation to limit com-
putational time.

Ref.[7] generated carpet plots for a large amount of
data for star grain configurations. It presented optimi-
zation for geometrical parameters of star grain while
leaving number of star points and varying other geo-
metrical parameters. The approach has severe limita-
tions for the large number of design variables. Ref.[8]
moved one step further and applied pattern search
technique to the design and optimization of 3D grain
configuration. The approach has limited applicability
in modern era as solution quality is heavily dependent
on starting solution. The approach has a tendency to
fall prey to local optima similar to any gradient de-
scent/ascent method and has extreme sensitivity to
the starting solution.

Ref.[9] presented design and optimization for fino-
cyl grain using generalize coordinate method. Ref.[10]
presented a hybrid optimization technique for finocyl
grain configuration using the same method.

The above discussion necessitates the requirement
of adopting heuristic optimization technique not only
to avoid local optima but also to eliminate the re-
quirement of starting point. Introducing computer
aided design (CAD) to the process will improve the
accuracy of calculated geometrical properties.

CAD based programs are available in industry and

have proved to be tremendously useful for the design
process of solid rocket motor (SRM). Two softwares,
PIBAL""" and ELEA!"”!, use CAD modeling for 2D
and 3D grains design of SRM. The former uses a
simplified ballistic model and the latter one can give a
point to point burning rate taking account of local gas
dynamics.

The methodology adopted in this work is CAD
modeling of the propellant grain. This approach creates
a parametric model with dynamic variables to define
the grain geometry. Surface offset simulates grain
burning regression and evaluates subsequent volume at
each step.

Upper stage SRM of launch vehicles requires highly
efficient propulsion system. An infinite number of pos-
sibilities exist, therefore, the need arises for intelligent
optimization approach which can control the design
domains and configure an optimum design within set
design limits and constraints.

3D radial slot geometry is extremely complex. It has
24 independent design variables that need to be opti-
mized to attain the best possible solution. The large
number of design variables complicates the optimiza-
tion process. The present study employs genetic algo-
rithm (GA) as the optimizer because of its robustness
and efficient capacity to explore the design space for
global optimum solution and eliminate the requirement
of an initial guess. The aim is to find the optimal con-
figuration while adhering to performance objectives
and design constraints.

2. Geometric Modeling and Regression

The grain geometry is based on CAD software that
has the capability of handling parametric modeling.
Grain is modeled in parts to provide ease and ensure
lesser chances of surface creation failure. A simple
variable input is sufficient to create the geometry. CAD
software is linked to MATLAB via Visual Basic.
MATLAB sends variable array to CAD software ena-
bling automatic creation of the grain geometry. CAD
software evaluates the geometrical properties and
sends to MATLAB for further calculations. Fig.1 pre-
sents the flowchart of the design process.

Fig.2 shows a detailed description of the grain mod-
eling. The following steps explain the construction of
grain configuration:

(1) Front and rear opening radii for chamber case,
motor length, ellipsoid ratio, and diameter are the input
parameters required to create the grain external bound-
ary (see Fig.2(a)).

(2) To construct the bore, front-end web along with
different dimensions are the input variables to be pro-
vided (see Fig.2(b)). The rear end can have large cy-
lindrical cavity provision for nozzle submergence.

(3) The input requirements to create slot are slot
thickness, web above slot and axial distance from cer-
tain references (see Figs.2(c) and (d)).

(4) In case a slot is not required the slot web is in-
creased to bore radius (see Figs.2(c) and (d)).

(5) Two configurations can be designed: front/ rear
slot configuration (see Fig.2(c)) and twin slot at the
rear end (see Fig.2(d)).

(6) Sharp corners are filleted to account for new sur-
faces that are created during burning as shown in
Fig.2(e). Lines AB and BC are connected using CAD
function “Connect”, so that they remain connected
during offsetting operation. Lines BC and CD are con-
nected through a small fillet of radius 0.1 mm in the
initial geometry. Offsetting process involves increasing
the fillet radius by a value equal to web increment.

CAD software performs the following steps for con-
structing the parametric geometric model after defining
the variables for grain configuration:

(1) Grain boundary is solid and constructed by re-
volve protrusion with no burning surface.

(2) Grain bore is constructed by revolve surface and
all surfaces burning.

(3) Boolean function is used to subtract the solid
within grain bore.

(4) Similar operation is performed for radial slots
and all surfaces burning.

(5) Surface offset function available in CAD soft-
ware 1s used to simulate burning, by offsetting the sur-
face by a web increment equal and orthogonal in all
directions.

(6) Boolean function is used at each web increment
to subtract the solid within grain bore and slots to cal-
culate new volume.

(7) Offsetting and boolean operations are repeated

till the web is completely burnt.

Model verification is performed by calculating star
grain burning area with the present method and ana-
lytical method. Star grain analytical expressions are
adopted from Ref.[13]. Fig.3 shows the comparison of
burning area between the two methods. Modeling pre-
sented in this article shows excellent performance
compared with analytical method.

The grain regression is achieved by equal web in-
crement in all directions. The selection of web incre-
ment is critical to grain regression. At each step new
grain geometry is created automatically thereafter
volume at each web increment is calculated. A de-
creasing trend is obtained for volume of the grain.

4. Optimization Method

GA can handle both discrete and continuous vari-
ables, making them well suited to major design prob-
lems. GA is capable of examining historical data from
previous design and attempts to look for patterns in the
input parameters which produce favorable output. GA
uses neither sensitivity derivatives nor a reasonable
starting solution and yet proves to be a powerful opti-
mization tool.

GA employs three operators to propagate its popula-
tion from one generation to another (a population of 30
members for 20 generations is found sufficient in the
present study). The first operator is the “Selection”
operator that mimics the principle of “Survival of the

Fittest’. Stochastic uniform option is used for selection.

The second operator is the “Crossover” operator,
which mimics mating in biological populations. The
crossover operator propagates features of good surviv-
ing designs from the current population into the future
population, which will have better fitness value on
average. Thirty percent of the population is used for
matting on a single point basis. The last operator is
“Mutation”, which promotes diversity in population
characteristics. The mutation operator allows for global
search of the design space and prevents the algorithm
from getting trapped in local minima. A uniform muta-
tion strategy is used with approximately a quarter of
the population. Details on GA can be found in Refs.
[17]-[20].

6. Conclusions

This research effort presents an automated approach
for the design and optimization of 3D radial slot con-
figurations. This approach integrates CAD software
and optimization module, and based on geometrical
data, ballistic performance 1s evaluated.

CAD model allows different entities of the grain, to
be modeled separately, which not only prevents surface
creation failures but also allows for future modification
of the model. Similar complex grain geometries can be
created by using simple input parameters and then op-
timized. The use of GA eliminates the problem of suit-
able initial guess. This approach attains optimized
design variables, adheres to design constraints and
proves a noteworthy increase in capability of searching
optimal solutions. A maximum of 600 function evalua-
tion is enough to converge to a global optimum.
