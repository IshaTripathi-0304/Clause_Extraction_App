Understanding of the WHO Standard Acupuncture Point Locations in the
Western Pacific Region: General Guidelines

Sung-Tae Koo, Yong-Suk Kim, Yun-Kyoung Yim, Sun-Mi Choi, Sung-Keel Kang

Abstract

Objectives: The aim of the study is to explain the general guidelines of the WHO standard acupuncture point loca-
tions (APLs). Understanding the general guidelines will enable experts to make clear use of the standard APLs for
education, research and practice.

Methods: In the beginning of the development of the standard APLs, experts drew general guidelines to achieve
mutual agreement among three nations (Korea, China, and Japan) on the standard APLs. The guidelines include point-
locating methods, syntax of descriptive sentences, landmarks on the body’s surface, reference acupuncture points,
usage of anatomical terminology, and proportional bone measurements.

Results: We found some considerable problems in the practical use of the APLs due to the strict application of
anatomical terms, even in ancillary phrases such as the regions of the body, in the sentence for each description.
Conclusion: We hope that this study will help readers understanding of the newly developed standard APLs and result
in increased application of acupuncture points and that it will be a reference for revising the WHO standard APLs in
the future.

Antioxidative and Anti-inflammatory Effects of Aurantii Fructus Immaturus
Pharmacopuncture

Sung-Jin Kim, Sang-Kyun Park

Abstract

Objectives: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. We investigated whether
Aurantii fructus immaturus (AFI) pharmacopuncture had antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects.

Methods: In in-vitro experiments, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity, superox-
ide dismutase (SOD) activity, prevention of H,0,-induced cell death in RAW264.7 cell line, DNA fragmentation, and
cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA expression induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were analyzed to investigate the antioxi-
dative and the anti-inflammatory effect of AFl pharmacopuncture. In the in-vivo experiment, a murine model of
dextran-sulfate-sodium (DSS)-induced colitis was used to examine the effect of AF] pharmacopuncture on CV12 at
different doses of 5uL0.5uL 0.05 uL. Body weight, colon length and macroscopic features were investigated.
Results: AFl pharmacopuncture showed DPPH free-radical scavenging and SOD activity in a dose-dependent manner.
AFI pharmacopuncture showed a protective effect against H,0,-induced cell injury and attenuated LPS-induced
COX-2 mRNA expression. In a DSS-induced colitis murine model, however, AFI pharmacopuncture at CV12 had no anti-
inflammatory effects.

Conclusion: The present results suggest that AFl pharmacopuncture extract may have anti-inflammatory and antioxi-
dative effects in in vivo test, but further research on the underlying mechanism is required.

Effects of Cornu Cervi Parvum Pharmacopuncture on the Blood Composition
and Antioxidative Activity in Rats

Kee-Byoung Lee, Sang-Kyun Park

Abstract

Objectives: This research was conducted to investigate the effects of Cornu cervi parvum pharmacopuncture with
regard to the blood composition and antioxidative activity in rats.

Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups (n=5 each), and two of the groups were treated with Cornu
cervi parvum pharmacopuncture every other day for 2 weeks. The groups were classified as follows: normal control
without treatment (control group), Cornu cervi parvum pharmacopuncture at CV4 (CV4 group), and Cornu cervi parvum
pharmacopuncture at BL23 (BL23 group). Thereafter, blood and liver samples were obtained for blood analysis and for
superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity measurements.

Results: The Cornu cervi parvum pharmacopuncture groups showed higher values of red blood cell count and plasma cell
volume compared with the control group (p<0.05). However, the hemoglobin level showed no significant differences
among groups. With regard to the blood picture, the concentrations of total protein and albumin in blood plasma
showed no significant differences in pharmacopuncture groups, but a higher ratio of albumin to globulin was observed in
the CV4 group. The white blood cell counts and the compositions of the blood showed no significant differences among
groups. The pharmacopuncture groups showed higher values in SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px activities than the control group.
Conclusion: Cornu cervi parvum pharmacopuncture alleviates oxidative activities in rats.

Dependence of the Temperature Change of a Warm Needle’s Body on
Moxa-Corn Weight

Seong-Hun Ahn, Deok Hong, Oh-Sang Kwon, Yu-Lee Kim, Jae-Hyo Kim, In-Chul Sohn

Abstract

Objectives: The warm needling technique is a combination of acupuncture and moxibustion. The purpose of this
study was to find the physical and the thermal characteristics of the warm needling technique in order to identify its
effects and the mechanisms.

Methods: In this study, thermal changes were observed with a testo 845 device, which is an infrared thermometer
specifically designed for measuring the combustion of corn-shaped moxibustion (moxa-corn). The thermal changes at
the apex of moxa-corn placed on top of an acupuncture point were observed at levels 1cm and 2cm from the apex to
understand heat conduction through acupuncture needle upon combustion of the moxa-corn.

Results: The thermal conduction through the acupuncture needle from the moxa-corn was related to the weight of
the moxa-corn and was inversely related to the distance of the moxa-corn from the needle’s tip and to the length of
the acupuncture. The temperature at thermal conduction to the apex of the acupuncture needle from the moxa-corn
was about 3—5°C.

Conclusion: The results of the present study may be useful in finding the mechanism and the effects of the warming
needling technique.

Effect of Acupuncture at PC7 (Daereung) on the EEG in Normal Human
Subjects

Cheol-Jin Park, Sang-Ryong Lee

Abstract

Objectives: The aim of this study is to examine the effects of acupuncture at PC7 (Daereung) on the normal human
EEG by using a power spectral analysis.

Methods: The EEG power spectrum exhibits site-specific and state-related differences in specific frequency bands. In
this study, the power spectrum was used as a measure of complexity. Thirty (30) subjects (16 males and 14 females;
average age=23.4 years) were engaged in this thirty channel EEG study.

Results: In the a (alpha) band, the power values at the Fp1, Fp2, F7, and F8 channels (p<0.05) during PC7 treatment
were significantly decreased. However, the power value at the Fz channel (p<0.05) during non-acupoint treatment was
significantly decreased. In the B (beta) band, the power values at the Fp1 and the Fp2 channels (p<0.05) during PC7
treatment were significantly decreased. However, the power value at the Fz channel (p<0.05) during non-acupoint treat-
ment was significantly decreased and those at the F8 and the TCP2 channels (p<0.05) during non-acupoint treatment
were increased. In the 6 (theta) band, the power values at the Fp1, Fp2, F7, and F8 channels (p<0.05) during PC7 treat-
ment were significantly decreased. But, the power values at the Fz channel (p<0.05) during non-acupoint treatment was
significantly decreased. In the 6 (delta) band, the power values at the Fp1, Fp2, F7, Fz, and F8 channels (p<0.05) dur-
ing PC7 treatment were significantly decreased, but the power value at the Fz channel (p<0.05) during non-acupoint
treatment was significantly decreased. The a/fB values during PC7 treatment were decreased, as were the f/6 values.
Conclusion: These results suggest that acupuncture at PC7 induces decreases in the a (alpha), B (beta), 6 (theta),
and 6 (delta) wave values, as well as both the a/f and the 8/0 values. Acupuncture at PC7 is thought to affect the
activity of the cerebral cortex and the endocrine system.

Abstract

Objectives: Bujeonghangam-tang (BH) has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of tumors. This study
was Carried out to clarify the effect of BH extract on hepatocellular carcinogenesis and hepatic cirrhosis induced by
diethylnitrosamine (DENA) and CCL, in rats.

Methods: The experimental groups were divided into two groups, the 8th and the 12th week administration groups,
and these were subdivided into four groups: the normal group, cirrhosis- and hepatic-cancer-induced control group, and
the groups administered BH extract at 320mg/kg/day (BHA) and 640mg/kg/day (BHB), respectively, under the same
conditions as the control group.

Results: In the 8th week group; the body weight decreased significantly in the control group compared with the normal
group. The activities of transaminase, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactacte dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly
increased (p<0.05) in the control group compared with the normal group, but were decreased in the BHA and the BHB
groups compared with the control group. Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) was increased the most in the control group com-
pared to the BHA and the BHB groups. In the results of light microscopical observation, a number of hepatocytes were
damaged in the control group compared with the normal and the BH extract administered groups. The number of
hepatic p53 positive cells was reduced in the BH extract administered groups. According to the electron microscopical
observation, hepatocarcinoma cells were observed more distinctly in the control group compared with the BH extract
administered groups. In the 12 weeks group, the results for the body were similar to those for the 8th week groups.
The transaminase and ALT activities were significantly increased (p<0.05) in the control group compared with the
normal group. LDH was significantly (p<0.05) increased in the control group compared with the normal group but was
significantly (p<0.05) decreased in the BHB group. Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) was increased the most in the control
group among the experimental groups. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was significantly (p<0.05) increased
in the control group, but the catalase activity was not increased (p<0.05) compared with the normal. The number of
hepatic p53 positive cells was increased in the control group. The results of electron microscopical observation were
similar to those for the 8th week group.

Conclusion: These results suggest that administration of BH extract suppresses or retards DENA- and CCl,-induced
hepatocellular carcinogenesis and hepatic cirrhosis in rats.
