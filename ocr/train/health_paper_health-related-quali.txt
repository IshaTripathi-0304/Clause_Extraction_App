Abstract

Background: Actinic keratosis (AK) is a common skin condition that may progress to non-melanoma skin cancer
(NMSC). The disease may influence Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), but studies of HROOL in patients with AK

are limited.

The purpose of the study was to analyze HROoL in patients with different severity levels of AK treated in dermatology
specialist care using generic and disease-specific HROOL instruments and to analyze their relationship.

Methods: AK patients who visited dermatological clinics in Denmark were included in an observational, cross-sectional,
study in a multi-center setting. Dermatologists assessed AK severity and patients completed: Actinic Keratosis Quality of
Life Questionnaire (AKQoL), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLOI), and EQ-5D-5 L including EQ-VAS. Differences
between categorical subgroups were tested with Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The relationship between instruments was

analyzed with the Spearman correlation test.

Results: A total of 312 patients were included in the analyses. Patients reported impairment in the disease specific HROoL
instrument AKQoL (mean AKQoL 6.7, DLQI 2, EQ-5D-5 L 0.88, and EQ-VAS 79). HRQoL was least affected in patients with
mild actinic disease, whereas patients with severe actinic damage suffered from further impaired HRQoL (mean AKQoL
10.1 and DLQI 4.6). Correlations between DLO! and AKQoL were moderate, whereas the correlations between DLO! and

EQ-5D-5 L and between AKOoL and EQ-5D-5 L were weak.

Conclusions: Patients with severe actinic damage showed more impairment in HRQoL than those with mild disease.
Correlations between instruments suggest that they are complementary as they measure different aspects of HRQoL and

are used for different purposes.

Background

Actinic keratosis (AK) is a common skin condition associ-
ated with cumulative sun exposure. AK lesions possess
the risk of progressing to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
[1-3], which is a common form of non-melanoma skin
cancer (NMSC). Whereas AK lesions may regress spon-
taneously [4], persons who previously suffered from AK
have an increased risk of developing new lesions [5]. The

prevalence of AK varies considerably and has been esti-
mated to between 1.4 and 25 % of the population [5-9].
In elderly people, in countries with higher ultra violet radi-
ation, and in patients receiving immunosuppressive treat-
ments, such as organ transplant recipients, the prevalence
is higher [10].

AKs typically present as red, scaly lesions on visible, sun-
exposed skin areas, such as face scalp and dorsal hands,
thus often causing cosmetic discomfort. In addition, AK-
lesions may itch, bleed, and adhere to clothing and due to
its pre-malignant nature patients may fear the risk of de-
veloping skin cancer. The presence of AK-lesions may thus

influence affected persons’ well-being because of cos-
metic reasons, locally hampering symptoms, and also
due to fear of developing skin cancer. Studies including
patient reported outcome measures and health related
quality of life (HRQoL) is increasingly used in clinical
practice and in clinical trials in dermatology [11]. Informa-
tion about HRQoL is requested both by clinicians and re-
imbursement agencies [12, 13]. Information is limited on
the potential impact of AKs, its accompanying symptoms
and treatments, on patients’ HRQoL [14-17].

There are several instruments available to investigate
HRQoL in dermatology. Generic HRQoL instruments
are used for a variety of diseases, which makes it possible
to compare the burden of different medical conditions.
The EuroQoL five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) is
a generic preference-based instrument, which can be
used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
QALYs are important in health-economic evaluations
and requested by reimbursement authorities [18]. It is
recommended to use both generic and disease specific
instruments in studies to capture different aspects of
HRQoL [19-21]. The EuroQoL Visual Analogue Scale
(EQ-VAS) is part of the EQ-5D questionnaire and it
measures patient's overall self-rated health status.

Dermatology-specific or disease-specific instruments in-
clude aspects of the HRQoL that may not be captured by
a generic instrument. Disease-specific instruments are
more responsive to disease activity and treatment out-
come and are therefore often used to reflect the patient
perspective in clinical trials and observational research.

The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is widely
used in dermatology, both in clinical practice and in
research [22, 23] and it has recently been used in pa-
tients with AK [24]. The questions in the DLQI focus on
physical limitations, rather than psychological impact of
skin diseases.

Recently, the Actinic Keratosis Quality of Life Ques-
tionnaire (AKQoL) was developed [14]. This question-
naire reflects how sun-damaged skin affects HRQoL and
has the primary focus on psychological aspects.

The objective of the study was to analyze HRQoL in pa-
tients with different severity levels of AK treated in derma-
tology specialist care using generic and disease-specific
HRQoL instruments and to analyze their relationship.

Methods

Study set-up

This is an observational cross-sectional multi-center study
with focus on clinical patient characteristics and patient
reported outcome measures. Data was collected at three
university hospital clinics and seven private dermatology
clinics in three geographic regions (Zealand, Funen and
Jutland) in Denmark. AK patients >18 years who visited

Page 2 of 9

the clinics during one specific week in May/June in 2012
were included.

Ethics, consent and permissions

The study was carried out after obtaining approval from
The Danish Data Protection Agency. All persons gave
their informed consent prior to inclusion in the study.

Data collection
Patients were asked to complete three separate HRQoL
questionnaires i) AKQoL, ii) DLQI and iii) EQ-5D with
5 response levels (EQ-5D-5 L), including EQ-VAS.
Information was collected about educational level,
employment, civil status and the following chronic co-
morbidities; asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease; heart or vascular disease; diabetes; gastro-intestinal
disease; cancer; joint disease (e.g. osteoarthritis, rheuma-
toid arthritis); physical disability or other chronic disease.
In order to characterize the severity of actinic damage,
physicians collected information about previous and
current AK lesions. Presence of AK was evaluated separ-
ately in nine anatomical regions (scalp, ears, face, chest,
trunk, arm, hand, leg and foot), and for each AK-affected
region, the following was registered: lesion count, lesion
thickness, presence of field-cancerization, clinical suspi-
cion of NMSC and selected treatment(s). Lesion count
was estimated and categorized as 1, 2—4, 5-20, or >20
lesions per area. AK-thickness was graded from I-III ac-
cording to Olsen et al. [25]. Field cancerization was classi-
fied as mild, moderate or severe, based on the clinical
presentation of surrounding skin and included mottled
erythema and pigmentation, telangiectasia, sallowness,
laxity, and dry skin texture, without fulfilling the definition
of AK. In the present study, ‘Severe Actinic Damage’ was
defined as an anatomical area with >5 lesions, dominated
by grade II-III AKs with moderate to severe field canceri-
zation. Consequently, ‘Mild actinic damage’ was defined as
an anatomical area with a single grade I AK without field
cancerization. Treatment and disease characteristics were
the focus in a separate publication [26].

Patient reported outcome measures of health related
quality of life

AKQoL is an AK specific HRQoL questionnaire including
9 questions with one single global item and three sub-
scales/domains: function, emotions and control [14]. The
questionnaire is reflecting personal daily life, personal
view of quality of life, social life, emotional life and control
of life [14]. Each question is scored on a 4-point scale: A
lot/all the time (scores 3), Quite a lot/often (scores 2),
Some/sometimes (scores 1), Rarely/not at all (scores 0). In
case only one question is incomplete, the missing value is
designated a score of zero and the patient is included in
the analysis [14]. A total score ranging from zero to a

----$$$$----$$$$----
Tennvall et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes (2015) 13:111

maximum of 27 is calculated by summing the score of
each question. The higher the score, the more severe is
the HRQoL impairment. The AKQoL includes the three
domains Function, Emotions, and Control, which are
summarized into one single Global item.

DLQI is a dermatology-specific instrument that relates
to how the skin disease has affected the life of the
patient over the past 7 days [23]. The questionnaire con-
sists of 10 questions in 6 dimensions: 1) Symptoms and
feelings, 2) Daily activities, 3) Leisure, 4) Work and school,
5) Personal relationships, and 6) Treatment. Each question
has 4 alternative answers: “not at all”, “a little”, “a lot” and
“very much”, scored 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The overall
score aggregates the score of each question. DLQI ranges
from 0 to 30, where a higher score represents more severe
HRQoL impairment.

EQ-5D is a generic HRQoL instrument. The question-
naire includes five dimensions, mobility, self-care, usual
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression [27].
The Danish version of the EQ-5D-5 L was used in the
study. The EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire has the same struc-
ture as the traditional three level questionnaire (EQ-5D-
3 L), but with five response levels: no problems, slight
problems, moderate problems, severe problems and un-
able to/extreme problems. Each combination of responses
is associated with utility values or relative weighting,
which are often derived from previous population-based
studies. Utility values are usually expressed on a scale ran-
ging between O and 1, where a higher value represents
better HRQoL but it may result in a value lower than zero
indicating a health state considered worse than dead. The
utility values make it possible to calculate QALYs, which
are essential in health economic evaluations of health care
interventions [18]. As utility values for the EQ-5D-5 L
were not yet available at the time of analysis, a Danish
value set, developed by the EuroQol group, was used to
transform values from the EQ-5D-3 L to the EQ-5D-5 L
version [28].

In the EQ-VAS part, patients were asked to indicate
their present health state on a vertical scale, numbered
from 0 to 100, where 100 is “the best imaginable health
state” and zero “the worst imaginable health state”.

Data analysis and statistical methods

Data analyses of background information and subgroup
analyses of HRQoL outcomes were performed using de-
scriptive statistical methods, using mean values, standard
deviations (SD) and proportions.

The AKQoL, DLQI, and EQ-5D-5 L values were ana-
lyzed overall and for subgroups of patients depending on
sex, age-groups (<60, 60-69, 70-79 and >80), current AK
at study visit, clinically suspected NMSC, lesion/s in the
face, current comorbidities, current AK treatment, im-
munosuppressive treatment, and previous SCC or not. In

Page 3 of 9

addition, analyses of HRQoL in subgroups of patients with
severe actinic damage or not was performed.

Statistically significant differences between categorical
subgroups were tested with Wilcoxon rank-sum test
(Mann—Whitney U test). For age groups a Kruskal-Wallis
test was used, which is an extension of the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test to several groups. Non-parametric tests
were chosen as the HRQoL outcomes were not normally
distributed.

Correlations between instruments were tested with the
Spearman correlation test to investigate whether there
was a relationship between them. The Spearman correl-
ation test gives an absolute value between 0 and 1, where
O indicates no correlation and 1 indicates perfect correl-
ation. The relationship could be positive or negative. A
high EQ-5D-5 L or EQ-VAS value means good HRQoL,
whereas a high score on DLQI or AKQoL indicates low
HRQoL. Correlations between EQ-5D-5 L or EQ-VAS
and DLQI or AKQoL therefore have negative values.

A multiple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression ana-
lysis with EQ-5D-5 L as the dependent or outcome vari-
able was performed in order to investigate how EQ-5D-5 L
was affected by age, sex, comorbidities, severe actinic dam-
age, and clinically suspected NMSC. Reference group was
man, no comorbidities, no severe actinic damage, and no
NMSC. Only patients with current AK lesions were in-
cluded in regression analysis.

A p-value lower than 0.05 was used as significance
level in all statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were
performed using Stata Statistical Software: Release 11.1.

Results

Patient characteristics and background

Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. A total
of 312 patients were enrolled in the study. The majority
of patients, 89 %, (1 = 277), had current AK lesions at
the study visit. The remaining 35 patients had attended
control visits for previous AK. Of all patients, 80 % had
a pre-history of AKs and 42 % suffered from recurrence
of a specific AK lesion.

Sixty-seven percent were retired, 16 % were working,
6 % reported other activities and 11 % did not report em-
ployment status. Comorbidities were reported in 66 % of
patients. The most common comorbidity was heart or
vascular disease (26 %), followed by joint disease (22 %)
and cancer (21 %). Nine percent were treated with im-
munosuppressive treatments.

A summary of the results from the different HRQoL
instruments is shown in Table 2.

than patients with no severe actinic damage (6.3) (p<
0.001).Women reported higher AKQoL scores (7.9), i.e.
worse HRQoL, than men (5.3) (vy < 0.001). The scores also
differed between age groups with patients younger than
60 years of age reporting worse HRQoL (8.1) compared to
older patients (5.0-7.3) (vy = 0.004). Patients with current
AK reported better HRQoL (6.5) than patients without
current AK (7.8) (p = 0.018).

The distribution between the different response levels
was similar in the different domains function, emotions
and control (Fig. 1). About 50 % reported problems in
each domain and in the single global item, 22 % reported
impairment in HRQoL.

The mean value for the 290 patients who completed the
DLQI questionnaire was 1.99 (scale: 0-30). Patients with
severe actinic damage had higher DLQI scores (4.6), ice.

Correlations between instruments and regression analysis
with EQ-5D-5 L as outcome

The correlations between the HRQoL instruments are
presented in Table 3. The analyses showed statistically
significant correlations in all comparisons except be-
tween EQ-5D-5 L and AKQoL and between EQ-VAS
and AKQoL. The correlation between DLQI and AKQoL
was strongest, 0.52 (p< 0.001). This indicates that DLQI
and AKQoL partly measure the same aspects of HRQoL.
The correlation between EQ-5D-5 L and DLQI was
weaker, —0.36 (p < 0.001) but showing that there is a rela-
tionship between a higher EQ-5D-5 L value and a lower
DLQI value. A similar correlation pattern, but weaker, was
shown between EQ-VAS and DLQI, —0.21 (<0.001).

The regression analysis with EQ-5D-5 L as the dependent
variable showed that HRQoL decreased significantly with
increasing age (—0.002 per year; p = 0.007), being a woman
(—0.039; p = 0.026) and comorbidity (—0.063; p = 0.001).

Discussion

This observational, multi-center, cross-sectional study,
showed that AK, especially severe actinic damage, has a
negative impact on HRQoL, as measured by the AK
and dermatology specific HRQoL instruments. This is
demonstrated in several of the dimensions or domains

in the different instruments and indicate that the dis-
ease specific and dermatological instruments capture
different aspects of HRQoL.

To our knowledge, this is the first study where derma-
tologists have assessed the overall severity level of the
AK disease in patients, rather than the severity grade in
particular lesions only. Furthermore, it is the first study,
to assess HRQoL with both generic and disease specific
instruments in patients with AK. Results from all instru-
ments showed more impaired HRQoL in patients with
severe actinic damage than in those who were defined as
having mild disease. The difference was statistically sig-
nificant for AKQoL and DLQI.

The strength of this study is that patients can be con-
sidered representative for a dermatological population as
they were included from different dermatology clinics in
different parts of Denmark. A weakness of the study is
that the sample in some subgroup analyses was limited,
and may therefore limit the possibility of statistically sig-
nificant results.

The only previously published study including the
AKQoL questionnaire describes the development and
validation of the questionnaire [14]. The mean AKQoL
score in that study was 9.5, which is similar to the score
of 10.07 reported in the present study for patients with
severe actinic damage. The AKQoL questionnaire is fo-
cused on the anxiety associated with sun damaged skin
and the risk of developing a more serious disease. Contrary
to what one would expect, patients with current AK lesions
had lower impairment in AKQoL than patients with no
current lesions. The reason for this may be that patients
who previously have had lesions may still be worried about
their skin as the risk of developing a new lesion is high [5].
The AKQol may therefore not be sensitive to change in
clinical outcomes. Further evaluation and validation of the

----$$$$----$$$$----
Tennvall et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes (2015) 13:111

AKQoL questionnaire is needed before any recommenda-
tions about the usefulness of the instrument can be made.

DLQI is commonly used in dermatology studies [20,
22, 29-35], but we found only two studies including
AK patients [24, 36]. In the first study DLQI was 1.95
for AK patients who received PDT with aminolevulinic
acid and 1.38 for patients treated with imiquimod [36],
in comparison to the mean value 1.99 for all patients
and 4.59 for patients with severe actinic damage in the
present study. In the second study DLQI varied from
1.6 prior to photodynamic therapy to 7.3 post treat-
ment but was then normalized [24]. DLQI values be-
tween 2 and 5 could be interpreted as low effect on
patient’s life while values from 6 to 10 could be interpreted
as having moderate effect [23]. In our cross-sectional
study, there was no statistically significant difference in
DLQI among patients who were currently in treatment
and patients who had completed the treatment. More re-
search is needed about how different treatment options
affect patients HRQoL. Previous studies of patients with
NMSC showed mean DLQI values of 2.4 and 4.9 [31, 32].
In observational studies of psoriasis and eczema DLQI
ranged from 4.5 to 6.8 [20, 33, 34]. In a study of acne
including a young population (mean age 22), the mean
DLQI was 9.2 [35]. In comparison with other dermato-
logical diseases such as NMSC, psoriasis and eczema,
patients with severe actinic damage thus have similar
HRQOoL, but better HRQoL than young persons with acne.

EQ-5D has previously been used in a variety of studies
of dermatologic conditions [20, 34, 35, 37-42], but we
found no study of AK. The burden of disease varies
between different skin conditions, with EQ-5D ranging
from 0.43 in herpes zoster [40] to 0.84 in acne [35] and
0.85 in the mildest form of atopic dermatitis [39]. For
severe actinic damage the mean EQ-5D value of 0.84 is
similar to both acne and mild atopic dermatitis. The
mean value of 0.88 in the overall patient group is similar to
the 0.89 in the general Danish population [43]. A recent lit-
erature review of the use of EQ-5D in economic evaluations
in dermatology included 20 studies identified between 2003
and 2011. The authors suggested that although the EQ-5D
is broad enough to allow comparison between different dis-
eases, it may not be specific enough to capture important
aspects of HRQoL in dermatology [44].

One limitation of comparisons across results from dif-
ferent studies is that the patient populations might not
be completely comparable regarding characteristics such
as age, sex and co-morbidity. In the general population,
women tend to report lower HRQoL than men and eld-
erly lower HRQoL than younger age groups [43, 45]. In
dermatology-specific HRQoL, however, younger individ-
uals have reported lower HRQoL than older age groups
[20]. This tendency can also be observed in our results,
especially in the AKQoL instrument where the difference

Page 7 of 9

in HRQoL between patients younger than 60 years of age
and older patients was statistically significant.

The correlation analyses suggest that the instruments
EQ-5D-5 L, DLQI and AKQoL are complementary as
they measure different aspects of the HRQoL. The mag-
nitude of the correlation between DLQI and AKQoL,
0.52, can be interpreted as moderate [46], while the cor-
relations between the DLQI and EQ-5D-5 L, -0.36, and
between DLQI and EQ-5D-5 L, -0.21, can be interpreted
as weak [46]. This is lower than previous findings of corre-
lations —0.51 to -0.55 between EQ-5D-5 L and DLQI in
patients with psoriasis [20, 34, 41]. There was no or little
correlation between EQ-5D-5 L and AKQoL, which was
expected as the EQ-5D captures overall HRQoL, and in-
cludes aspects beyond the impact of the skin.

The role of EQ-5D in economic evaluations in derma-
tology has been questioned as the EQ-5D is broad
enough to allow comparison between different diseases,
but it may not be specific enough to capture important
aspects of HRQoL in dermatology [44]. Therefore, it is
important to use both generic, dermatology- and disease
specific HRQoL measure in dermatologic conditions such
as AK.

The generic EQ-5D is important for health economic
evaluations and it is essential as long as it is preferred by
reimbursement authorities and policy makers for compar-
ing costs and benefits across medical conditions [12, 13].
Moreover, generic instruments also measure comorbidi-
ties that go beyond conditions of the skin.

The DLQI is dermatology specific and is therefore
more sensitive to detect changes in HRQoL related to
clinical outcomes in dermatological conditions, which
could be useful for regulatory authorities and for clini-
cians to individualize interventions and provide optimal
care for patients. Moreover, as it is one of the most
commonly used instruments in dermatology, the DLQI
is appropriate for comparison with other skin diseases.

Whereas, the DLQI has been criticized of being too
focused on physical limitations rather than the psycho-
logical impact of the skin [47], the AKQoL is focused on
emotions and worries related specifically to sun dam-
aged skin. The AKQoL captures domains of the HRQoL
which are of relevance for persons with AK as they may
worry about lesions developing to SCC. Furthermore,
since the AK population is relatively old, some questions
in the DLQI such as how much the skin caused prob-
lems in sports, work or school, and sexual relationships
might be of less importance for an elderly population.

Conclusions

The EQ-5D-5 L, DLQI and AKQoL provide comple-
mentary information and are all useful, as they capture
different aspects of HRQoL. Whereas the EQ-5D is es-
sential for economic evaluations, the DLQI is responsive

to change in relation to treatment and the AKQoL cap-
tures important features of the HRQoL that are specific-
ally related to sun damaged skin. Future research is
needed to further evaluate the responsiveness to change
of the DLQI in relation to treatment and the AKQoL
needs to be validated in future clinical studies.

The present study has shown that patients with severe
actinic damage have impaired HRQoL, while patients with
mild disease are less affected. HRQoL in patients with
severe AK is similar to HRQoL in patients with psoriasis
and eczema.
