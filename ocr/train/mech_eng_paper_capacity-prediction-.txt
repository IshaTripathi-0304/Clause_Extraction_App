Capacity is an important design parameter for roundabouts, and it is the premise of computing their delay and queue. Roundabout
capacity has been studied for decades, and empirical regression model and gap-acceptance model are the two main methods to
predict it. Based on gap-acceptance theory, by considering the effect of limited priority, especially the relationship between limited
priority factor and critical gap, a modified model was built to predict the roundabout capacity. We then compare the results between
Raff’s method and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method, and the MLE method was used to predict the critical gaps.
Finally, the predicted capacities from different models were compared, with the observed capacity by field surveys, which verifies

the performance of the proposed model.

1. Introduction

Roundabouts are popular in recent years, according to
statistics; there are over 2000 roundabouts in the US and
Canada as of April 2010 [1]. And more and more scholars
have paid their attention to roundabouts from different views,
such as capacity, safety, and performance. Capacity is the
maximum possible throughput of the traffic facility [2], and it
is a determinant parameter for other performance measures,
such as delay and queue. Thus, there are a lot of researches on
this, especially on capacity model [3-8].

The entry capacity is the maximum throughput of the
entry vehicles under specific geometric and traffic conditions.
Until now, there have been lots of capacity models, which
could fall into two categories: empirical regression model
and gap-acceptance model [9]. According to previous anal-
ysis, the former has good applicability in locality but poor
transferability, and its establishment needs mass data. Al-
Madani [10] established an empirical model during heavy
demand conditions, which considered eight factors such as
number of entry lanes and radius of central island, whilst
the latter has a systematic and theoretical basis, but usually
oversimplifies the field conditions, and is dependent on some
assumptions (e.g., the headway distribution of the major
road). Kimber [11] analyzed the gap-acceptance model in

major-minor priority junction and summarized the merits
and drawbacks of this method. Chung et al. [12] compared the
capacity model in SR45 and SIDRA, which were both based
on gap-acceptance theory. Considering the pseudo-conflicts,
Fortuijn [13] revised the conflict volumes by introducing
some proportion of exiting vehicles and derived a new gap-
acceptance model for turbo-roundabout. By modifying Raft’s
method, Guo and Lin [14] updated the capacity model on the
basis of gap-acceptance theory.

In gap-acceptance theory, critical gap is one of the most
important parameters, which impacts the predictive accuracy
directly. And numbers of researchers have discussed the
estimation methods and critical values from different aspects.
Considering the punch size of the follow-up vehicles, Khatib
[15] built a regression model for the critical gap by field
data at multilane roundabouts. Flannery and Datta [16] used
log-normal distribution to depict the gap-acceptance process
and discussed the different distribution patterns. Besides, the
probability method was used in the critical gap estimation
at roundabout, and move-up times were collected according
to the dominant entry lane and subdominant entry lane
[3]. Some studies showed that the number of lanes has an
influence on the performance [17-19]. Hainen [20] obtained
the critical headway of roundabouts by means of wireless
magnetometers. Abrams et al. [21] collected the spatial and

temporal headway and estimated the critical gap from these
two aspects. Moreover, others considered the effect of the
influence factors on critical gap. Considering the percentages
of trucks, Lee [22] adjusted the critical gap and follow-
up time by distinguishing different vehicles type, which is
more accurate. Then an investigation was made as four-year
period, it was found that the critical gap reduced because
of higher driver familiarity [23]. Polus [24] put forward the
critical gap model that considered the effect of waiting time at
roundabouts and improved the entry capacity model. Xu and
Tian [25, 26] found that the circulating flow rate and speed
are the main factors influenced by the critical gap and follow-
up time. And by data collecting at roundabouts, the result
showed that the critical gap of the left-turning lane is larger
than the right-turning lane's.

Under high flow conditions, some minor vehicles may
force their way into the major streams; meanwhile the major
vehicles would slow, which was named limited priority by
Troutbeck [27]. And Troutbeck and Kako found that the
limited priority merge has a significant effect on the entry
capacity at two-lane roundabouts [28]. The limited priority
term was derived. Ma et al. [29] also studied the limited
priority merge in the major-minor intersections.

Although the studies on roundabouts overseas are quite
a lot, it is still in its infancy in China. In recent years, more
and more domestic scholars have studied the roundabouts,
but the research was limited in a small range, that is, signal
timing at roundabouts, and the operational characteristics at
roundabouts. Wang et al. [30-32] discussed the capacity of
roundabouts and provided some reference for future studies.
Considering the limited priority in capacity prediction at
modern multilane roundabouts and through analyzing the
relation between limited priority factor and critical gap,
the comprehensive effects of the two on capacity would be
obtained. The headway distribution of the circulating lanes
will be discussed by considering the limited priority. Then,
combining the number of the circulating lanes, a new capacity
model could be derived.

This paper is designed as follows. Section 2 introduces
the gap-acceptance theory in the unsignalized intersections
and the limited priority under high volume conditions. Then
the relation analysis between the limited priority term and
critical gap at roundabouts is discussed in Section 3. And the
headway distribution of the circulating lanes is also discussed;
then the capacity model is derived based on gap-acceptance
theory. Following the estimation methods to the critical gap
are compared in Section 4. Then the proposed model is
compared with some classical capacity model and discussed
with the field observations in Section 5. Finally, Section 6
gives the conclusions and points out the future works.

2. Applicability Analysis of Fundamental
Theories on Multilane Roundabouts

This part mainly depicts two theories at roundabout, that
is, gap-acceptance theory and limited priority theory. Com-
bined with the operational characteristics of the multilane
roundabouts, an applicability analysis was conducted to
verify the suitability of the two theories.

2.1. Gap-Acceptance Theory at Roundabouts. Gap-acceptance
theory was originally applied to traditional unsignalized
intersections. Generally, there are major road and minor road
for the two-way stop-controlled (TWSC) or two-way yield-
controlled (TWYC) intersections. And the vehicles from the
minor road enter the intersection during the gaps formed
by the major streams. Because there are “give-way” rules at
the roundabouts, it is analogous to the TWSC intersections.
But the geometries of the roundabouts are different from
traditional intersections, so it may have some difference in
entry process, shown as in Figure 1.

As shown in Figure l(a), the vehicles in the minor road
need to cross over the major flows. But, in Figure 1(b), the
entry vehicles only need to converge into the circulating
streams, which is similar to the convergence behavior on the
ramp. Assuming that the mean speed of vehicles at TWSC

intersection is v, and the distance between stop line and
conflict line is S,, thus, the cross time is (S, + L)/v, (L is the
vehicle length). For the same analysis to modern roundabout,
the entry time is (S, + L)/v, (S, is the distance between stop
line and merging point at roundabout, and v, is mean entry
speed of vehicles at roundabout). Clearly, the difference in
geometry leads to the different travel distance. Meanwhile,
the entry speed from the stop line is different. Thus, the entry
time of the two types of intersections is different. Of course,
there will be inserting behaviors if there are two or more
circulating lanes. Thus, at a micro level, the critical gap may
have some differences, and it shows the necessity to calibrate
parameters by field observations additionally.

2.2. Limited Priority at Roundabouts. Troutbeck proposed
that the minor-stream vehicles forced the major-stream
vehicles to slow in the high volumes, and it will occur in the
roundabout by filed observations [28]. The results showed
that the ratio of forced gap was more than 9% under high
volumes and less than 3% under low ones. Because the drivers
in different countries have different driving behaviors, a field
survey is made in Changchun, China, consequently. The data
were collected at a three-lane roundabout in Changchun
city during peak hours. There are three circulating lanes
in the roundabout, and the condition during survey period
was normal. Fifteen-minute data sets were extracted for
this analysis. If the circulating vehicles decelerate before the
conflict area, there is a limited priority event. Summing up
the statistic results, the percentages of the limited priority in
different traffic status are obtained, as shown in Figure 2.

As can be seen from Figure 2, when circulating flow rate
reach a certain degree, the percentage of limited priority
will rise with the circulating volumes increasing. And from
the field observation, it is found that there exist some
adventurous drivers in Changchun city, which often forced
the circulating vehicles to slow, even if the circulating flow
rate is low. Although this verifies the existence of limited
priority phenomenon, a comprehensive influence coefficient
needs to be established, which can change with the varied
conditions. To prove this phenomenon further, the speed and

headway before and after merging were surveyed; the differ-
ence distribution could be obtained as shown in Figure 3. It
is noted that the data were collected in one lane, and one is
obtained in the upstream of the circulating lane; another is
obtained in the merging area.

From Figure 3, it can be seen that the speed and headway
between the upstream and merging area both have some
changes. In Figure 3(a), the most of the speed difference
centers on zero, and some are located on the right side.
Similarly, the headway also has the same effect; however, it
has left truncation. Both of them reflected that some vehicles
in circulating lane slow before the merging area.

Above all, by analyzing and observing the multilane
roundabout, applicability of limited priority gap-acceptance
theory is verified.

3. Capacity Modeling

Considering the limited priority at multilane roundabouts,
some parameters were analyzed in this part. Then combined
with limited priority gap-acceptance theory, a modified
model is derived.

3.1. Relation Analysis. From the above, it is known that
the limited priority phenomenon existed in the round-
abouts. By field observations, the limited priority percentage
was obtained, but it did not suit accurate calculation and
lacked portability for other roundabouts. Assuming that the
upstream of the major stream obeys Cowan's M3 distribution,
the model of limited priority term (C) was derived by
Troutbeck [27], as shown in (1). From this, C is mainly
determined by three parameters, that is, critical gap (t.),
follow-up time (t), and the minimum headway (r). He also
pointed that the limited priority will occur when the critical
gap is less than the sum of follow-up time and the minimum
headway. Among them, t ; and t are usually measured during
the saturation periods, or the continuous queue occurs at the
entry approach. But the critical gaps could not be measured
directly, which is usually estimated with some estimation
methods. And another parameter in (1) is A, which depicts
the intensity of proportion of free vehicles on the traffic flow
in Cowan’s M3 model, also named decay constant. In order
to obtain the interrelations among these parameters, assume
that the t, and t are constant; then analyze the relations of
other parameters based on (1), and we obtained the changes
of C with A and t,. The result was shown as in Figure 4:

C= 1] - ety
© [tee 2 (t,-tp — 1) eM] ' (1)

where A is decay constant, usually equal to aq/(1 — tq), and
a is the proportion of free vehicles.

In Figure 4, the tendency of C is varied with A and t.. On
the one hand, when tf. is relatively large (of course, it will not
exceed the sum of t , and T), the decrease of C is not obvious.
With the reduction of the t., the decrease tendency is more
sharp. The smaller the t., the sharper the tendency. On the
other hand, when A do not change, C will rise with the t,
depressed.

With the limited priority factor, a corresponding capacity
model of single lane was also put forward [27], as shown in
the following:

Cap = ———__, (2)

where Cap is capacity of single lane.

As can be seen from (2), there is a positive correlation
between Cap and C and a negative correlation between Cap
and t., whereas C varies from 0 to 1, which reduces the
original capacity. According to common sense, the capacity
will raise considering the limited priority. In addition, C is a
function of t., as shown in (1). To obtain the comprehensive
relations among these parameters, combined with the results
of Figure 4, we studied the entry capacity with the changes of
t.; the result was shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that, in the

same conflicting volume, the entry capacity will reduce with
the t, increasing. To analyze it further, if the limited priority is
considered, the critical gap will reduce because of the forcing
stream; thus even if the C is less than 1, the result of capacity
will still increase. This result is consistent with the realities;
thus Troutbeck’s model was used in this paper.

3.2. Headway Distribution of Circulating Lanes. Headway dis-
tribution is as an important assumption in the gap-acceptance
theory. Applying the different headway distribution models,
the different prediction capacity will be obtained. Generally,
the negative exponential distribution, the shifted-negative-
exponential distribution, and Cowan's M3 distribution are
the most popular models in traffic analysis. But the first
two are applicable to free flows, and the last one is mainly
applicable to the dichotomy flows. Though Cowan M4
distribution is more accurate, some proposed that the more

realistic headway distributions are not significantly more
accurate. Luttinen [40] dissected the properties of Cowan's
M3 distribution and detailed the estimation method to the
parameters. Besides, Cowan's M3 distribution model has been
proved a good performance at roundabouts. Hagring et al.
[41] divided two types of Cowan's M3 distribution, M31 and
M32, and found that M32 was closer to the real capacity
of two-lane roundabouts. Giuffre et al. [42] compared the
performance between turbo-roundabout and double-lane
roundabout, assuming that the headway of circulating lanes
obeyed Cowan's M3 distribution. Xiang et al. [31] assumed
the two flows as an equivalent flow and derived the approach
capacity treating the vehicles of the left lane and right lane,
respectively.

In this paper, considering the effect of limited priority,
the circulating vehicles will decelerate, and the parameters
of headway distribution may change. In order to obtain
accurate headway distribution, an investigation was made
to the multilane roundabouts in the high flows, and the
cumulative probability curves are shown in Figure 6. The
six different sites were selected, and all located at before the
merging area.

If the circulating vehicles slow to cooperate on the
forcing vehicles, the headway of circulating streams near the
merging area will also change. Combined with the merging
opportunity in the limited priority [27], Troutbeck derived
the modified gap distribution model before the merging area,
as shown in the following:

F(t)=1l-aCe*“”, tr. (3)

There are many models to describe the proportion of
free vehicles (@) [40, 43, 44], as shown in Table 1. And it is
determined mainly by the circulating volume (q,) and the
minimum headway (rT). To show them more straightforward,
Figure 7 is obtained as follows. From this figure, it can be seen
that different models have different performance. When the
traffic volume is 500 pcu/h, the difference between Plank and

Brilon’s result could reach 0.462, and it will make the capacity
larger in difference.

In Cowan’ M3 distribution, the decay constant (A) is
also an important parameter, indicating the intensity of
proportion of free vehicles on the trafic flow. And it is
generally expressed as aq,/(1—-tTq,). If different models of
a are used, the A will also change. The variation of the A
with the traffic flows is shown in Figure 8. Then, combined
with Figures 7 and 8, Troutbeck’s model was selected in the
following research.

By field observation, the modified Cowan M3 distribution
could be used to fit the headway distribution before the
merging area. Comparing with Cowans M3 distribution,
the curve of modified model is closer to the empirical

can see that the modified model is better in the shorter
headway than the original one.

In this part, the modified headway distribution was
proved a better goodness of fit to the merging headway in high
flow. Based on this equation, the derivation of capacity model
of multilane approach is proposed next.

3.3. Model Derivation. From the above analysis, the impact of
the limited priority on multilane roundabouts is expressed.
Combined with the actual situation of multilane round-
abouts, the derivation of capacity model is introduced in the
following.

Assumptions
(1) The circulating flows obey the modification of
Cowan's M3 model above.

(2) The drivers of entry approach have homogeneity and
consistency.

(3) The lane-changing behavior is prohibited in the cir-
culating areas.

(4) The circulating vehicles in different lanes are indepen-
dent of each other and obey the same distribution.

a = 0.910 — 1.1564,

In addition, the entry vehicles may be influenced by
the exiting vehicles in the same leg at some roundabouts
[4]. However, it only occurs in some certain situations; for
example, the diameter of central island is small or the splitter
island is too narrow. And field surveys showed that the
vehicles would use the indicators when entered in or exited
out from roundabouts in Changchun city, coupled with the
larger island diameter; thus, the impact of exiting vehicles
to entry capacity could be negligible in this research. Based
on the above assumptions, the derivation process is listed as
follows.

As per the extended process of Tanner’s formula by
Hagring at unsignalized intersection [39], H(h) indicates the
headway distribution, and L(/) indicates the lag distribution.
And the capital letter denotes the cumulative distribution
function; the lowercase letter denotes the probability density
function. H; is the headway distribution of lane i, and H
represents the headway distribution of n lanes. Similarly, L;
is the lag distribution of lane i, and L represents the lag
distribution of n lanes. And the headway distribution of lane
i is expressed as (3), so the derivation process is following.

As per Haight [45], the lag density function of circulating
lane i is

I; (t) = q;(1- Hj (0). (4)
Combining (3) and (4), one can obtain that
L(t) =qa,cje""™, t> 7. (5)

Thus one can obtain the lag distribution function of
circulating lane i:

L, (t) =1- t > T;. (6)

The relationship of lag distribution function between the
whole circulating lanes and a single lane is [39]

Then combining (6) and (7), one can obtain the distribu-
tion of n-lane:

Thus, the lag density function of n-lane is

Using the relationship of lag density function and the
headway distribution headway once again, that is, combining
(9) and (4), one can obtain that

As per Hagring, if every lane has one certain value, f =

as

To simplify, define Nn = (>; A; / di qi II; (qja;C;/A,); let tj

For an n-lane road, the probability of k vehicles crossing all

p(k) = H (toy + kt pysteg + kt pps. esten + Kt fn)

-H (ta +(k-Dtpyteat(k-Vty--sten (13)

Combining (12) and (13), one can obtain that
p(k) =n,e 2A? (oP? Ajit — eo kX; Ato), (14)

According to the discrete theory [39], the general formula
of capacity is

Equation (16) is the general capacity model of multilane

of single-lane roundabout; that is,

By comparison, (17) is the same as Troutbeckss.

and follow-up times, and equal minimum time (T), so we can
obtain that:

For an entry lane, if there is no constraint, the vehicles

4, Critical Gap Estimation

In the gap-acceptance theory, the critical gap is the most
key parameter, whose accuracy directly affects the entry
capacity, which also could be seen in (16). Until now there
are over thirty kinds of estimation methods, and we should
select an appropriate estimation method against the multilane
roundabout.

The maximum likelihood method was employed for esti-
mating critical gap at TWSC intersections [47]. And for two
major streams, Hagring [48] put forward a derivation process
for the critical gap. Brilon et al. compared nine estimation
methods for the critical gap and put forward four criteria
of the reasonable prediction method. By comparisons, the
maximum likelihood method and Hewitt’s method are the
best. In addition, Raff’s method is used widely and easily, but
it is sensitive to trafic volumes [49].

Combining with the above analysis, the maximum like-
lihood estimation (MLE) method and Raff’s method are
compared by field survey. In Raff’s method, the mean critical
headway is the intercept of the F,(t) and 1— F(t), where F,(t)
is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of accepted
headway, and F,(t) is the CDF of rejected headway. Based
on the assumption that one driver's critical gap is larger than

his maximum rejected gap and smaller than his accepted gap,
the MLE method was used to estimate. Assuming the drivers’
critical gap obeys the log-normal distribution, Troutbeck [50]
proposed a procedure for estimating the mean and standard
variance of critical gap, shown as in the following:

2 2
t. = elt 10.00 > s° = t? G _ 1) > (22)

where 4 is the mean of distribution of logarithms of drivers’
critical gap, o” is the variance of distribution of logarithms of
drivers’ critical gap, and s is the standard variance of drivers’
critical gap.

The survey site is a two-lane roundabout in Changchun
city, and the critical gap of right lane and left lane was
estimated, respectively. Define the two circulating lanes as
near lane and far lane, respectively; the former is adjacent to
the entry lane, and the latter is near the central island. In the
two entry lanes, the vehicles from the left lane may enter both
circulating lanes, but the vehicles from the right lane only
can enter the near lane. ‘The result of right lane using Raft’s
method is shown as in Figure 10, and the similar method
could be conducted to other lanes. Besides, the MLE method
is also applied to the same lane, and the results were obtained
as in Table 2.

From Table 2, it can be seen that the results of two meth-
ods are similar, and the big difference is 3.8%. Considering
that Raff’s method is sensitive to traffic volume, however, the

MLE method is robust and, because of this, MLE method was
selected for estimating the critical gap in the following.

5. Model Comparisons

By field survey at the multilane roundabout in Changchun
city and by comparisons with three classical capacity models,
the practicability of the proposed model was validated.

5.1. Analysis of Three Classical Models. Three existing capacity
models were selected to compare with the proposed model.
The first is Wu's capacity model, which is recorded in German
Highway Capacity Manual (HBS) 2000 [2]. The second is
the recommended model provided in the Highway Capacity
Manual (HCM) 2010, which is drafted by FHWA [51]. And
the third is Swiss model, which considers the effects of exiting
flow and other influences [9]. The first and the third one could
dispose one to three lanes, both circulating lane and entry
lane. For the second one, the entry capacity of left lane is used
in this paper due to the multilane being merely discussed, and
it is aimed at two lanes. Combined with the above analysis,
only one entry lanes capacity aiming at different number of
circulating lane is discussed. The different models are shown
as (23) to (24), respectively. Consider the following:

T-q.\"" 1
qe =n,(1-—£) = - exp (-q - (tp - 7)
n t
nel (23)

a1 = 1130e°°75 * 10 *)q.
e, >

where q, is the entry capacity, q. is the conflict flow rate of
the circulatory lane, n, is the number of entry lanes, n, is the
number of circulatory lanes, and t) = t,-t,/2, and q,, is the
capacity of left entry lane.

The Swiss model also depicted the entry capacity with two
or three circulating lanes as follows:

de = (1500 - : 4) -B, (24)

where q, = y:q, + 4+ 4q,, in which q, is exiting flow;
however, according to analysis above, it could be negligible
in Changchun city, so the item could be simplified to y*q., y:
[0.6, 0.8] for two circulating lanes (default = 0.66) and [0.5,
0.6] for three circulating lanes (default = 0.55), : [0.9, 1.1]
for single entry lane (default = 1.0).

5.2. Comparisons of Capacity Models with Field Data. By
video camera, two sites were observed in Changchun city; one
has two circulating lanes, and another has three circulating
lanes. Ignoring the different movement from one lane, the
innermost entry lane was selected, from which the vehicles all
enter into the innermost of the circulating carriageway. The
follow-up times were extracted in one-minute intervals, when
the persistent queue occurred. Besides, the critical gaps were
estimated by MLE method. Applying the parameters into the
above capacity models, the results are shown in Figure 11.

As can be seen from Figure 11(a), the proposed model
has good consistency with Wu's model, which both have

goodness of fit with field data. However, the Swiss model
overestimated the entry capacity for two circulating lanes; the
model of HCM 2010 boasts the opposite. In Figure 11(b), there
is the same tendency with Figure l(a). However, it could
be seen that the proposed model vastly overestimated the
capacity during low circulating volume.

Relative error (RE) method has been widely used in
transportation analysis [52-57]. In this study, to compare the

capacity models with the field data, we also apply this method,
mathematically represented by

where Cy.14 is the entry capacity by field observation and
Cyredict 18 the predicted entry capacity.

The maximum value, the minimum value, and the average
value of RE are computed on the conditions of two and three
circulating lanes; the results were listed in Table 3. The results
showed that the proposed model and Wu's model have better
prediction effects than other models. And the prediction to
the two circulating lanes is better than the three lanes.

6. Conclusions

Considering the limited priority at multilane roundabouts
and based on Troutbeck’s research on this at the unsignalized
intersection, the relation between limited priority factor and
critical gap was discussed. Then, by improving the headway
distribution of circulating streams after merging, the modi-
fied entry capacity model aiming at n-lane was derived based
on gap-acceptance theory at multilane roundabout. By simply
analyzing and comparing different estimation methods, the
MLE method was selected to estimate the critical gap of entry
lane in this study. Finally, three classical capacity models
and the proposed model were compared with the filed data,
that is, two-lane roundabout and three-lane roundabout,
respectively. By comparisons with the RE of different models,
Wu's model and the proposed model show better prediction
performance.

In the case study, the vehicles from one entry lane
all entered a definite circulating lane, and mixed purpose
vehicles should be considered in the future research. Further-
more, O-D flows may affect the entry capacity [58], and the
roundabout capacity on the whole may be more appropriate
for application in engineering.
