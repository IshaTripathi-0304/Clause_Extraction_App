Abstract

An Industrial Product-Service System (IPS?) is characterized by a high integration of product and service shares. This implies that
the providing company develops an IPS? consisting of product share, e.g. a highly complex precision machine tool, and service
share to increase customer value, strengthen the relationship between customer and provider and finally generate profit. However,
providing an IPS? involves a high degree of organizational effort. The operation of an IPS? includes the detection of service
demands, strategic and operative scheduling of processes and resources, coordination of service and supply network partners and
the monitored delivery of service processes.

In this paper, an IPS? Control Architecture for the operation phase is proposed. Then, the function and application area of two
software systems, the IPS?-Execution System and the IPS?-Control System, are described and their interaction within the proposed
architecture is outlined. Furthermore, the detailed interaction process is illustrated in an application scenario in order to demonstrate
the advantages and necessity of both systems and their interdependency. Also, an outlook on further research is given.

represents a knowledge-intensive — socio-technical
system.”

IPS? aim at fulfilling contractually defined customer
needs by the provision of product as well as service
shares. To be able to guarantee a contracted business
model [3], delivery processes are developed, planned
and executed. Delivery processes can be maintenance
procedures, technological upgrades, spare part deliveries
or even training courses. Each of the delivery processes
has requirements that have to be fulfilled by resources.
These resources can be provided by a network of
partners as well as by the provider or the customer.
Hence, for the operation of IPS’, the organization of

networks and the planning methods need to be executed.
2.2. IPS? organization and planning

The organization needed for providing IPS? is a
layered network structure. The provider can use third
party suppliers and resources of the IPS? customer to
ensure the operation of an IPS?. The provider and all his
suppliers form the Provider Network (PN) [4]. With the
methods of strategic capacity and operational resource
planning for IPS*, IPS? networks are formed [5]. They
consist of all partners that take care of a specific IPS?.
The IPS? network includes the customer of the IPS? as
well. For each delivery process that is executed, an IPS?
delivery network (IPS? DN) is_ instantiated. Only
partners involved in the execution are involved in the
IPS? DN [4].

Strategic capacity planning is used to determine the
capacities needed to supply all IPS? of a provider.
Capacities of all kind of resources like humans, spare
parts and tools are taken into account. The result of the
planning is a delivery plan for all IPS”. It contains a
schedule for each delivery process to be executed and
the assignment of resources to delivery processes [5].

Whenever an unplanned incident occurs at one IPS?
which requires a new delivery process to be planned,
Operational resource planning is used. The available
resources are redistributed and the delivery schedule
adjusted to provide the new delivery process for one
IPS? while not affecting the operation of other IPS”. Both
the strategic and operational planning methods can be
implemented using an genetic algorithm [5].

Network management for IPS? as well as planning
has to be carried out by the IPS? provider. To support
him in performing these tasks, a software tool fitting his
needs can be used. An IPS?-Execution System (IPS?-ES)
can provide the required functionality. Using cloud
computing, the task of planning capacities and resources
for several IPS?, possibly hundreds, can be executed in
real time. The closely connected management of the
network is supported by using an open architecture
inside the system [6]. Especially information about

planned delivery processes and resource availability has
to be exchanged.

2.3. Condition monitoring and service process support

The automation of the operation of an IPS? aims at
the control of processes in both product and service
shares. On product share side, these processes can
include condition monitoring of critical components [7],
tools [8] or the automated execution of service related
machine routines [9]. On service share side, the
processes include human processes such as diagnosis or
spare part exchange. The closed-loop control of such
human processes is established through interactive
instructions for a service technician with an adaptive
workflow sensitive to the actual state of the product
share. An IPS? process can include several involved
actors on product as well as on service side.

An agent system therefore provides means_ to
represent all actors involved in IPS? operation and to
execute such necessary processes [10]. The agent
paradigm is founded on the view of a system as a
computational organization consisting of various
interacting roles [11]. The machine tool, individual
components or consumable parts such as milling tools
can be subject to monitoring, for example if their
availability is guaranteed in the IPS? contract. Also each
party involved in the IPS? operation is represented by a
software agent to ensure the automated communication
between these partners.

The advantage of this agent-based IPS? control
system is the flexibility of reacting to changing business
models and service network partners. Furthermore, the
complexity within one technical system consisting of
many components can be handled in an efficient manner.
Lastly, the shared definition of an overall concept in
terms of a common ontology facilitates the agent
communication and the long term data processing
leading to an externalized knowledge representation.

3. Proposed Concept for IPS? Control

A machine tool sold and operated as an IPS? is
characterized by a high integration of product and
service shares. This implies that product and service
share can be substituted if they have the same function
or sub function in terms of fulfilling a customer need.
During operation, the provision of service shares require
that organizational efforts are undertaken in order to
fulfill a contracted degree of service (e.g. availability) in
an economically feasible way. A complete automation of
necessary processes seems desirable in this context, but
is highly challenging due to the vast multitude of
uncertainties that had to be considered. This especially
applies to the manual processes that become necessary

331

----$$$$----$$$$----
332

on site of the product share. Looking at the current state
of the art in planning, execution and documentation of
engineering services and their great potential for
rationalization, these challenges need to be overcome in
order to assure an efficient, secure and high quality
operation of IPS?.

The proposed approach encapsulates tasks necessary
for the IPS? delivery and treats them as control
problems. By pursuing this approach, a_ partial
automation of processes shall be reached. Parts of the
processes that require the manual execution of tasks are
considered analogously.

The fact that an IPS? is a dynamic system that
requires continuous effort of the IPS? provider is
inherent in its definition [1], [2]. These circumstances
already lead to the representation of an IPS? as a control
loop in the development phase [12]. However, in order
to control an IPS? including its product and service
shares during the operation phase, further aspects have
to be considered and the control loop has to be extended
to this phase of the lifecycle. Therefore, an IPS? Control
Architecture is proposed.

3.1. Design of an IPS? Control Architecture

An IPS? can be considered a Large-Scale Complex
System: it is composed of a number of smaller
constituents which serve particular functions, share
particular resources, governed by interrelated goals and
constraints and require more than one controller [13].
Controlling these kinds of systems, there are different
approaches, which all aim at the reduction of
complexity. From purely hierarchical multilevel
systems, which allow the circulation of feedback only
along the vertical axis, a development towards
heterarchical concepts emerged [14]. Heterarchical
control schemes allow the horizontal exchange of
information among different control units on the same
level, providing means for cooperation.

Looking at the abovementioned challenges in IPS?
operation, an IPS? fulfills customer needs by providing a
specified degree of performance. This level can be
expressed in contractually defined parameters, e. g. in
terms of availability or quality of output parts.

In order to provide the degree of performance agreed
upon during the operation phase, the IPS? has to be
influenced on various levels depending on its current
State.

3.1.1. IPS? Control Model

During its operation, an IPS? can be influenced on
several levels. In the framework of this paper, these
levels are distinguished as follows:

1. Lifecycle level

2. Operation level
3. Process level
4. Effect level
IPS? operation on each of these levels is considered as
a closed-loop control system (Figure 1). A closed-loop
control system generally consists of controller, actuator,
controlled system and measuring unit (see Figure 1 on
operation level). Through a continuous measurement of
the controlled system, its deviation from the command
variables is assessed in the controller. A decision is
made in the controller on basis of the deviation and a
correcting variable is passed on to the actuator, which
imposes a correcting effect in the controlled system.
Subsequently, the controlled system is measured.
Higher level control loops determine the goals of the
lower levels, resulting in command variables. Thus, all
levels mutually affect each other.

Lifecycle level

The Lifecycle level contains the contract definition
for and the development of the IPS?. Based on the
customer demands, the business model is created and an
adequate IPS? product model developed and
implemented. The IPS? is then continuously evaluated
regarding its fulfillment of customer needs and possible
deviations from the defined goals are reacted to with
adaptions of the business model. Newly arising or
changing customer demands can be covered by business
model adaptions. According to the changes, the IPS?
product model is adjusted. By these means, the overall
customer value is maintained throughout the IPS?
lifecycle. The control loop has a time horizon of several
days to weeks.

Operation level

Looking at the operation in greater detail, the
Operation level provides the basis for ensuring required
command variables. These are defined as IPS? target
values, in order to determine the level of performance
for the IPS? operation. A target value could be the
Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), or individual
factors of the OEE equation. The desired influence on
these values is achieved by strategic and operational
planning of delivery processes and the consideration of
process requests due to unplanned demands.

Based on the IPS? product model, the initial delivery
plan consisting of delivery processes is created with the
strategic capacity planning method. The continuous
monitoring of relevant machine and operational data on
Process and Effect level measures the actual IPS?
performance parameters. These parameters are then
compared with the target corridors and allow the
detection of any deviations.

Such deviations indicate new and often unforeseen
demands. The operative scheduling of processes with

----$$$$----$$$$----
H. Meier et al. / Procedia CIRP 12 (2013) 330 — 335

available resources is necessary to fulfill these demands.
The needed type of process has to be available in the
IPS? product model in order to be _ scheduled
automatically as a response to the demand. The adequate
process is selected by the IPS?-CS. Based on this
selection the process is included in the updated delivery
plan. If no suitable process is available in the product
model, the demand for a new process is escalated to the
Lifecycle level. The consequence would be a
reconfiguration of the IPS? business model. The
Operation level has a time horizon from several hours to
several weeks.

Process level

For each of the deployed processes of the delivery
plan, a closed-loop control is established on the Process
level. The whole solution space of possible process steps
including available alternatives is defined in a so-called
process network. Utilizing the inherent flexibility of
these process networks, the optimal sequence of process
steps will be adapted to the actual situation according to
the closed-loop feedback.

Recognized symptoms are transformed into possible
goals and lead to a decision about which process step to
choose next. The aim is to execute the overall process in
the most effective way. Whenever it is not possible to
reach the goal with the range of available process steps,

an additional delivery process has to be scheduled on the
Operation level. The Process level has a time horizon
ranging from hours to minutes.

Effect level

Each concrete process step is controlled on the Effect
level by influencing the system and monitoring the
result. Both the product share (the technical system) and
the service share (the service activity) are controlled
interdependently. The Process level has a time horizon
ranging from milliseconds to minutes, depending on the
type of effect to be obtained.

For the technical system, the influence is obtained
automatically, either through actuators or the changing
of intrinsic system variables. Means of condition
monitoring are applied in order to track each action.
Depending on whether the intended effect was achieved
or not, appropriate measures can be taken as a reaction.
The operations on this level therefore come closest to the
conventional, technical understanding of a closed-loop
control system.

On the service side, the influence is achieved by
multi-modal instructions for the personnel providing the
service process [15]. The monitoring of the action can be
realized by directly tracking the human activity [16] or
the effect on the technical system by the monitoring
function of the IPS?-CS.

When an inappropriate action or effect is detected,
according instructions are issued.

The interdependencies between product and service
share which exist in an IPS? are visible on the Effect
level and express how the IPS? control architecture can
utilize both to reach an effect. However, when the
intended effect cannot be achieved with the selected
process step, an alternative step has to be selected on the
process level.

All levels are connected through the consistent goal,
from which the command variables on all levels are
derived. Also the abovementioned _ escalation
mechanisms provide means for transfer of control
towards a higher level to expand the solution space in
order to deliver the contractually defined customer
value. While the control on the process level and the
Effect level is executed for one specific IPS’, the
Lifecycle levels and the Operation levels of different
IPS? are interconnected and have a wider range of
influence. On the Lifecycle level, features and processes
are developed for one specific customer, however, the
results can be used to design and implement an IPS? for
another customer. On the Operation level, processes for
multiple IPS? are planned centrally, but the request for
including a process for one IPS? in an updated delivery
plan is issued by each IPS? independently.

On all levels, data has to be collected to provide an
information basis for new developments or changes of
IPS?. Among this data are the command variables, the
control factors, the control variables and the measured
variables. Based on knowledge that can be derived from
this data, the control on the Lifecycle level, especially
the design and implementation phases for an IPS’,
retrieves new input for a better fulfillment of customer
needs.

In the following, the focus is set on the Operation
level of the IPS? control architecture. On these levels, the
existing methods developed for the management of
delivery networks, the planning of capacities and
resources as well as the control of process steps will be
set into context accordingly. Through the connection of
these systems, the core of the IPS? Control Architecture
will be established.

4. Operation Level in Detail

On the operation level, the agent-based IPS?-Control
System (IPS?-CS) is considered as the controller (Figure
1) and the IPS?-Execution System (IPS?-ES) as the
actuator. They determine what influences have to be
exerted in order to keep the IPS? as the controlled system
in Figure 1 in stable operation. The monitoring
component of the IPS?-CS is the measurement unit and
ensures the closed-loop control by providing the data the

IPS?-CS needs to make a decision. The decision is
submitted to the IPS?-ES in order to become effective.

Looking closer at this functional behavior, we first
have to understand which decisions can be made for
what reason by the IPS?-CS. The following example is
given: A micro machine tool is operated in an
availability-oriented business model: Therefore, critical
components are subject to monitoring. The IPS? solution
space offers delivery processes for keeping up the
availability. Therefore, a plan with scheduled delivery
processes is in effect.

During the manufacturing operation, a critical state of
the spindle is reached and detected by the monitoring
component of the IPS’*-CS. Because a failure of the
component would affect the availability of the whole
machine, the IPS?-CS decides that a spindle exchange is
required. The spindle exchange process is defined in the
IPS? product model and has several requirements
regarding human resources (skills), tools and spare parts.
The IPS?-CS also derives the urgency of the process
from the monitoring data, e. g. the actual availability of
the IPS*. Because the availability is guaranteed to be
above 95%, and the actual value in this example is above
98%, the criticality is considered medium. Subsequently,
this data is submitted to the IPS?-ES.

The IPS?-ES retrieves data about the required process
from the IPS? product model. The default time window
could be 72h. Thus, the individual time window is
calculated. The calculation is based on the default time
window given by the process description and the
criticality provided by the IPS?-CS. For this example, the
actual time window could be adjusted to 48h.

The process including the generated time window
information is then included in the delivery plan and the
planning algorithm is executed to optimize the delivery
plan. The scheduled downtime of the machine given by
the IPS* customer is taken into account during this step.
This determines, at which time the process is actually
executed and which resources are utilized. The new
delivery plan is then passed on to the IPS?-CS.

In this example, the requirements for the interfaces
between the IPS?-CS and the IPS?-ES are clearly visible.
The first interface needed has to be designed for
information transfer from the IPS?-CS to the IPS?-ES.
Through this interface, data about a required process and
its urgency is transferred. The information has to be
consistent throughout both systems. Therefore, the IPS?
product model has to contain an individual ID for each
available process for reference and IPS?-CS and IPS?-ES
have to agree on a domain for urgency. Based on this
urgency domain, specific rules on how the different
urgency values are applied to the default time windows
have to be defined.

The other interface to be established is for
information transport from the IPS?-ES back to the IPS?-

----$$$$----$$$$----
H. Meier et al. / Procedia CIRP 12 (2013) 330 — 335

CS. Here, data about the new delivery plan for a specific
IPS? is transferred. The delivery plan contains delivery
processes including their actor and the time at which
they are scheduled. Also, the resources involved in the
delivery process execution are specified. With this
information, the IPS?-CS can then start the control on the
Process level for each individual delivery process.

5. Conclusion and Outlook

In this paper, an IPS* Control Architecture is
proposed to set the several levels of IPS? during the
Operation phase into a general context. Lifecycle level,
Operation level, Process level and Effect level mutually
influence each other by controlling delivery processes or
a whole IPS?. Each level is used to guarantee the
contracted customer value on a different level and with a
different scope. While the Lifecycle level focuses on the
general IPS? and the design of product and service shares
as well as the necessary delivery processes, the operation
level uses the IPS? target values inherited from the
Lifecycle level to provide a structured plan for the
execution of the delivery processes. On the Process
level, each delivery process is guided to provide the
intended effect. Human activities and automated routines
are supervised on the Effect level.

To provide the aforementioned complex control,
control systems are in effect on each distinct level.
Based on information about state of a machine tool or a
delivery process, required measures can be derived.
Setting these measures into effect has an influence on
the IPS? and therefore the customer value.

With an example, a detailed view on the operation
level is given. IPS?-CS and IPS?-ES are introduced as the
controller and the actuator respectively on this level. The
exchange of data between these systems to provide the
control needed is described in detail.

Further research has to be carried out to substantiate
all levels of the IPS? Control Architecture. Moreover, the
interaction between the individual control systems has to
be analyzed in-depth. For the operation level, the
proposed interfaces have to be realized and the definition
of the urgency domain is required.
