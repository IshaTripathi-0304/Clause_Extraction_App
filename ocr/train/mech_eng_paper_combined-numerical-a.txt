Combined numerical and experimental
investigation of the micro-hydrodynamics
of chevron-based textured patterns
influencing conjunctional friction

of sliding contacts

Abstract

Reciprocating and low-speed sliding contacts can experience increased friction because of solid boundary interactions.
Use of surface texturing has been shown to mitigate undue boundary friction and improve energy efficiency. A combined
numerical and experimental investigation is presented to ascertain the beneficial effect of pressure perturbation caused
by micro-hydrodynamics of entrapped reservoirs of lubricant in cavities of textured forms as well as improved micro-
wedge flow. The results show good agreement between numerical predictions and experimental measurements using a
precision sliding rig with a floating bed-plate. Results show that the texture pattern and distribution can be optimised for
given conditions, dependent on the intended application under laboratory conditions. The translation of the same into
practical in-field applications must be carried out in conjunction with the cost of fabrication and perceived economic gain.
This means that near optimal conditions may suffice for most application areas and in practice lesser benefits may accrue

than that obtained under ideal laboratory conditions.

Introduction

Energy efficiency is progressively viewed as the most
essential attribute for all machines and mechanisms.
An important source of energy inefficiency is friction,
which may be viewed as an energy sink. Therefore,
except for some occasions where friction is crucial
for fulfilling certain functions, such as in
traction, braking or locomotion, its minimisation
is an important design goal. The increasing scar-
city of fossil fuels with the associated increase in
cost and their adverse effect on the environment are
key motivators in the drive to mitigate the effects of
friction.

As friction occurs naturally, there have been many
attempts since antiquity to minimise the required
effort to overcome it, as well as forming an under-
standing of it. Amontons’ described the underlying
mechanism of friction as the interaction of rough
surfaces, independent of their apparent area of con-
tact. Later Euler” provided the first definition for the
coefficient of friction and its relation to the state
of motion. Coulomb*® confirmed the findings of

Amontons and Euler in distinguishing between static
and kinetic states of friction.

The Amontons—Coulomb fundamental laws imply
friction as an inherent property of surfaces; their
topography and mechanical properties. However, by
the turn of the 20th century it became clear that these
fundamental laws do not apply to real surfaces which
are invariably wetted either by an applied film of
lubricant or their contact tribo-chemistry leads to
the formation of an oxide surface layer when exposed
to normal atmosphere.*” In fact, nature itself has
made use of rough surface topography in the presence
of a fluid to enhance load-carrying capacity and also
reduce friction. One example is the combined action

of fairly rough cartilage covered surfaces and synovial
fluid in the endo-articular joints of all vertebrates
through the mechanism of micro-elastohydrodynamic
lubrication.® Therefore, nature’s own choice seems to
run contrary to Amontons—Coulomb laws of friction.
The perspective appears to be that of surface-
lubricant as a system.

At the diminutive physical scale of surface asperi-
ties, boundary-active fluid species can adsorb to sur-
face features, as well as being entrapped and entrained
into the asperities’ interspatial valleys.”* Therefore,
unlike the idealised dry friction, wet rough contacting
surface topography can actually aid lubrication and
reduce friction. The realisation of this point has grad-
ually led to the introduction of engineered textured
features on sliding surfaces. In fact, the use of various
surface texture forms has been shown to improve
tribological performance in Costa and Hutchings,’
Etsion and Burstein'? and Ronen et al.'’ among
others. Numerical and analytical analyses have also
led to the determination of ‘optimal’ texture form,
geometry and distribution for sliding contacts, for
example by Rahmani et al.'*"°

The introduction of surface textures is most effect-
ive in circumstances when poor contact kinematics
such as stop-start, reciprocating motion or low rela-
tive surface speed leads to lack of lubricant entrain-
ment into the contact. These circumstances lead to
boundary regime of lubrication. There are many
such instances in various machines. For example, in
internal combustion engines, piston motion reversals
at top and bottom dead centres are accompanied by
the momentary cessation of lubricant entrainment
into the piston skirt and ring pack. Use of surface
texturing, introduced in the vicinity of piston rever-
sals, has shown to reduce frictional power loss, both
analytically,'* as well as through testing by Etsion'?
and combined studies by Rahnejat et al.'° Other
investigations include that of Yu et al.'’ for the
effect of texturing during sudden changes of speed in
mechanical face seals and that of Pettersson and
Jacobson'® for reciprocating ring/roller contact in
hydraulic motors. It is suggested that the cavities
formed by the introduced micro-structures can act
as lubricant reservoirs or encourage micro-wedge
effect (micro-hydrodynamics) for lubricant entrain-
ment.!*'°!??9 The micro-hydrodynamic effect is
analogous to the pressure perturbations in natural
mammalian joints,° which improve the contact load-
carrying capacity.'* In fact, aside from this localised
effect, surface textures have also been shown to
expand the region in which hydrodynamic lubrication
occurs.”!

The geometric form and distribution of texture fea-
tures have also been investigated by many authors.
The form largely depends on the method of manufac-
ture/fabrication such as vibro-rolling,”* ion reactive
etching, indentation,**** abrasive jet machining,”°
photo-lithography,”° anisotropic etching”® and laser

surface texturing (LST),'*!°?"7> the last of which
has gradually become the process of choice. This is
because LST lends itself to a greater degree of auto-
mation as well as a better control for application to
curved surfaces such as cylinder liners'® and piston
ring face-width,”’ as well as fabrication of different
texture geometries. Ryk et al.*’ introduced partial tex-
turing on the compression ring’s flat chamfered face-
width, noting this to be the most effective in reduction
of friction in their engine tests. On the other hand,
Howell-Smith et al? noted that whilst texture
features can act as reservoirs of lubricant and aid
reduction of friction, they may also cause oil loss in
piston cylinder system as well as breach the sealing
function of the compression ring. This suggests that
it is better to introduce these features on the station-
ary cylinder bore/liner in the vicinity of the top ring
reversal. Their results show that indented liners with
features resembling the cross section of a Vickers tool
provide optimum performance in a high performance
fired engine. However, laser-etched crescent shapes
(analogous to a chevron) are more practical and
cost effective to produce on curved concave surfaces
and perform nearly as well as the indented features.
Costa and Hutchings” also investigated a range of
surface texture shapes, including chevrons under slid-
ing conditions, where the largest improvement in gen-
eration of a hydrodynamic film was observed.

The current study combines numerical analysis and
experimental measurement of chevron-shaped surface
textures under sliding conditions. A numerical para-
metric study of the chevron shape design has been
carried out, using improved chevron textures and dis-
tribution. The results are validated experimentally
with the use of a reciprocating precision sliding
bench-top test rig. The aims of the investigation are
two-fold; firstly to further the fundamental knowledge
of surface texturing and secondly, to demonstrate the
design and development process for a suitable surface
texture which can be used in real engineering
applications.

Reciprocating sliding contact

Reciprocating or low-speed sliding contacts are sub-
ject to a transient regime of lubrication. Poor tribo-
logical conditions invariably occur at contact
reversals, where lack of any relative sliding motion
of the mating surfaces results in the momentary ces-
sation of lubricant entrainment into the contact zone.
This leads progressively to a greater number of ubi-
quitous asperities on the counterfaces coming into
contact, leading to mixed or boundary regimes of
lubrication. Such conditions are quite prevalent in
many forms of contact, such as_ piston-cylinder
system.’ Sliding contacts operating in the mixed or
boundary regimes of lubrication experience increased
frictional power loss when compared to fluid regimes
of lubrication such as hydrodynamics, thus the reason

for the various applications of texturing to the con-
tiguous surfaces,'*'° all of which have shown 2-4%
reduction in in-cylinder frictional losses, ascertained
through improved BMEP. A more direct method of
measurement would be preferred as well as linking
any reduction in friction to the prevailing regime of
lubrication. A direct in situ method of measurement
for cylinder applications has been through the use of a
floating liner, which is dragged by the reciprocating
piston relative to the bore surface by an infinitesimal
amount. The floating liner is flexibly mounted to the
cylinder bore through intervening load cells which dir-
ectly measure friction. Such arrangements have been
reported by Furuhama and Sasaki*” and Gore et al.*°
for engine testing conditions, although not including
surface textures. However, friction in the engine cylin-
der is dependent on the many physical interactions
arising from variations in the combustion chamber
pressure, heat generation and thermo-elastic deform-
ation of contiguous solids. Therefore, a fundamental
scientific study is preferred to focus on the effect of
surface texturing under controlled laboratory condi-
tions, at least in the first instance, prior to engine
applications. Hence, development of a precision reci-
procating slider on a floating base-plate analogous to
a floating cylinder liner would be advantageous. The
focus of this study is mixed lubrication conditions at
low sliding speed, whilst traversing a textured region.
These conditions were noted for the engine case in
Rahnejat et al.,'° where the textured area was pro-
vided at the top compression ring reversal point.

A reciprocating slider bench test rig has been devel-
oped and described by Chong and De la Cruz et al.**
(Figure 1). A sliding thin strip slider with a face-width
profile, representative of an engine compression ring
is loaded against the flat plate, with a thin layer of
lubricant applied. The plate is mounted upon preci-
sion, low friction bearings and is allowed to float,
when dragged by the sliding strip. An electric motor
is directly coupled to the loaded sliding strip via a low
friction and almost backlash-free lead-screw drive.
Piezo-resistive force sensors, positioned at either
ends of the plate directly measure the inertial force
of the floating plate, which is due to the generated
contact friction as

\) F=-f,=ma (1)

Short run times and _ suitable intervals are
implemented to ensure repeatable testing conditions
(See Appendix 2). A rotational laser Doppler vibrom-
eter is used to record the actual speed of the sliding
strip and a base oil is selected to lubricate the contact.
This is a Grade 3 base stock (highly paraffinic with
ultra-low sulphur content, with a viscosity index,
VI> 125). No boundary active lubricant species are
used in the base oil, as these would adsorb to the
surfaces and form an ultra-thin low shear strength

film, which would affect the repeatability of the
experimental work. Further data for the base oil are
listed in Table 1.

The thin strip is made of martensitic AISI 440C
stainless steel hardened to 62 HRC. The flat plate is
made of 150M19 (EN 14) carbon manganese steel,
electroplated with a 140 um thick nickel-based coating
containing co-deposited silicon carbide particulate
(Ni-SiC). This coating is the choice for many cylinder
liners of high performance race engines. The surface is
then ground and polished. The corresponding data is
given in Table 2.

Laser surface texturing

Chevron-shaped textures were laser etched onto a
region of the floating plate as shown in Figure 2.
A SPI 50 Watt fibre laser was used to create the chev-
rons. The laser parameters are provided in Table 3.

After the LST process, the plate is polished for a
short period of time to remove any residual splatter or
debris protruding from the surface. Figure 3 shows an
image of typical laser-etched chevrons obtained
through the Alicona infinite focus microscope with a
measurement resolution of 1 nm.

The surface roughness of the plate and the flat ring
were measured (Table 2), as well as the chevron depth
and the sliding strip’s face profile. The chevrons have
a thickness-to-depth ratio of 0.11 (representative of an
optimised ratio as demonstrated by Etsion and
Sher*®), although some variation in the chevron
depth is produced in the LST process.

The LST produces chevrons with a cross-sectional
profile similar to that of a parabola (Figure 3), and are
therefore, modelled accordingly.

Numerical analysis

Prior to laser texturing of any form, geometry and
distribution of chevron-type textures onto the surface
of the sliding plate, it is important to undertake
numerical analysis of the contact. This is due to the
fact that there can be numerous combinations of geo-
metrical parameters and distribution patterns with
different outcomes. Therefore, the numerical analysis
can provide the range of values that it 1s expected to
yield desired performance from the textured surface.
This can be carried out at low cost in comparison to
the manufacture of a sufficiently varied set of samples.
Then, a parametric study can be undertaken to strive
to optimise the texture pattern and form with respect
to minimisation of friction. A limited number of
cases, advised through numerical simulation, can
then be physically tested.

The reciprocating sliding contact is subjected to a
transient regime of lubrication. Lubricant is entrained

the load intensity (load per unit length) for lightly
loaded top ring in low sliding motion in the compres-
sion stroke prior to the TDC reversal for cylinders of
89mm bore diameter with an assumed full circumfer-
ential conformance to the liner surface. A comparison
of the load intensity between a fired engine and the
reciprocating slider test rig is shown in Appendix 3.
Under these conditions, reported by Akalin and

Newaz*? and Mishra et al.*° mixed regime of lubrica-
tion 1s prevalent with no localised deformation of
surfaces.

A fully flooded inlet is assumed as the surface of
the floating plate is provided with a layer of free sur-
face film ahead of the sliding contact as shown in
Figure 4. In the case of an engine, a starved inlet
boundary can be encountered, particularly in the
upstroke motion of the piston as a free surface film
may not exist on the hot surface of the bore/liner.

The outlet boundary conditions are those of
Swift®’—Stieber*® (Reynolds’ exit boundary condition)
with an assumed atmospheric vaporisation pressure of
the lubricant at the film rupture point. The current
boundary conditions do not take into account the
effect of cavitation beyond the lubricant film rupture
boundary. Cavitation can affect the load-carrying
capacity of the contact. Elrod’s*’ cavitation method
can be used instead of the Swift-Stieber boundary
conditions to take this issue into account. This
imposes continuity of Couette flow beyond the film
rupture point. Even a better approach is to use a
mass-conserving multi-phase approach with open
exit boundary conditions such as that described by
Ausas et al.*° who used this approach for the study
of textured surfaces in journal bearings. They showed
that cavitation plays an important role in load-
carrying capacity and generated friction.
Shahmohamadi et al.*! also used this approach for
the study of lubrication for piston compression rings
but for untextured surfaces and with the inclusion of
thermal effects. Shahmohamadi et al. showed that in
the case of ring-bore contact, cavitation occurs mostly
at mid-stroke piston positions where the results of
their computational fluid dynamics analysis diverged
from that with non-mass-conserving approaches. In a
detailed study of various boundary conditions in
piston compression ring conjunction, Arcoumanis
et al.** concluded that the Swift-Stieber boundary
condition agreed better with their experimentally
measure conditions. Based on these finding, the cur-
rent analysis uses the Swift-Stieber exit boundary
conditions. The inlet pressure at the front face of
the strip is also set to the atmospheric pressure.
Only a segment of the whole strip’s width in the
y-direction (direction of lubricant side-leakage) is
included in the model to keep the computational
time to an acceptable level. The applied load for the
section of the contact considered for numerical ana-
lysis is shown in (Table 2). Hence, the computational
boundary conditions are

The generated pressures at such low loads are

short testing times, isothermal analysis is undertaken

already noted, with relatively low applied load, no
localised deflection of the contiguous solid surfaces
is expected, as also noted in Akalin and Newaz>?
and Mishra et al.°° The contact of the sliding strip
can represent a fully circumferentially conforming
piston top ring to the liner surface, when viewed as
unwrapped. In this approximation the ring is assumed
not to undergo any elastodynamic behaviour. In real-
ity, Baker et al.*° have shown that in fact the top
compression ring undergoes modal deformation to
conform well to a right circular cylindrical liner and
perform its desired sealing function. Therefore, the
approximate representation made here is quite
reasonable.

Face profile of the sliding strip

The strip’s face-width profile 4, is measured, and is
modelled as only varying in the x -direction (direction
of entraining motion). The axial strip profile is
an important factor for the entrainment of the
lubricant into the conjunction through hydrodynamic
inlet wedge effect.° Therefore, sliding rings often

have profiled edges such as small relief radii or
chamfers.

For the purpose of numerical analysis, the strip
profile was measured using an Alicona Infinite
Focus Microscope; with a measurement resolution
of Inm. From the measurements taken, the strip
slider profile in Figure 6 is created using the following
set of equations

Strip Face Width (mm)

where, s is the gradient of the ring profile in the x-
direction at both ends of the ring profile, g is the film
profile at x =0 (the intercept) and r and gq refer to the
edge and flat land film shape. Figure 6 also shows the
profile of laser textured chevrons.

sion angle, the perpendicular (length), width and

chevrons in a row, y (in the transverse direction) and
the separation between rows of chevrons, x (in the
direction of sliding) were taken into account, as well
the commencement and termination points of the

The laser surface texturing process produces a

of the typical asperity slope.© These parameters are
obtained through topographical measurements. The
statistical function Fs/2(A) is introduced to match the
assumed Gaussian distribution of asperities as a func-
tion of the Stribeck oil film parameter, 4 = h(x, y)/o.
This is obtained as follows®

Fs>(A) = max{—0.0046/° + 0.005742"
— 0.295823 + 0.784427
— 1.07762 + 0.6167, 0} (16)

Greenwood and Tripp*° model is applicable to sur-
faces with Gaussian distribution of asperities. For
such surfaces the statistical skewness parameter
S,¢ = 0 and the kurtosis*’ S;,,, = 3. Clearly, with the
inclusion of chevrons on a hitherto Gaussian surface
the skewness value would not remain zero. Through a
series of measurements carried out on in-process wear
of plateau honed cylinder liners in fired engine tests,
Gore et al.*” showed that for run-in cylinder liners the
depth of the valleys R,, was almost unchanged, whilst
the peakiness on the formed plateau between the
grooves (R,;) were quickly removed, leaving a plateau
height of mean roughness height of R;. The skewness
parameter for the plateau tended to zero (ie. a
Gaussian plateau height). In the case of laser etched

plates in the current work, the chevron depth acts in a
similar manner to that of Gore et al.*’ engine tests of
cylinder liners. No boundary interactions are expected
over the chevron areas, but only on the plateaus
formed between them, the roughness distribution
over which may be considered to follow a Gaussian
distribution. In the absence of an alternative, simple
analytical method to that of Greenwood and Tripp*°
and the evidence of similar representative surface by
Gore et al.*’ such an approach is assumed here. Later,
the close agreement between the experimental meas-
urements and the numerical predictions give further
credence to the assumption made.

Method of solution

Reynolds equation is discretised using finite difference
method, including density and viscosity as functions
of generated pressure for the sake of completeness of
the method, although the generated hydrodynamic
pressures are insufficient in this instance to signifi-
cantly alter the lubricant rheological state. Thus

and using central differences for the second-order pres-

any computational node (i,j) is obtained through a

method. The pressure for each node is updated
using under or over-relaxation, subscripts m and o
denote new and old iteration steps.

The relaxation factor y is problem-dependent and
an optimum value which provides rapid convergence
is usually obtained after some numerical tests.

Convergence criteria

A two stage convergence process is sought. The first
criterion is based on the convergence of generated
hydrodynamic pressures and the lubricant rheological

The second criterion is load balance for instantan-

If this criterion is not met, then the minimum film
thickness is adjusted as

where x iS an adjusting parameter,
x = W— F,/max{W,F,}. A damping coefficient of
6B =0.05 is used to effect faster load convergence,
whilst avoiding numerical instability.

Finally, a typical analysis cycle requires an initial
guess as the nominal minimum clearance.

Friction and power loss

In the mixed regime of lubrication, anticipated in the
case of contact of the sliding strip against the flat
floating plate, two sources contribute to friction; vis-
cous shear of the lubricant entrained into the conjunc-
tion and any direct interaction of counterface
asperities.

At any time the viscous shear of a lubricant film h
can be obtained as:

Piao Vp-ard (24)

The gradient is defined as V = {90/ Oxi + 0/ ay7).
The Eyring shear stress*® for the base oil used in
this study is 2 MPa. The maximum shear stress calcu-
lated using equation (24) under the testing conditions
reported in this paper is only 7 kPa. Thus, the base oil
is subjected to Newtonian shear for this lightly loaded
low sliding speed conditions

fy =tA, =TA (25)

where 4 is the apparent contact area. Since the area of
asperity contact is usually very small, then:
A, = A— A, = A. It should be noted that the asperity
contact area is less than 1% of the apparent contact
area. The asperity contact area for their assumed
Gaussian distribution is*°

Under the mixed regime of lubrication, boundary
friction must also be taken into account.

It is assumed that boundary friction comprises two
contributions; one is as the result of direct contact of
asperities in the form of their adhesive junctions, which
must be broken in order to sustain the sliding motion.
If the pressure-induced shear strength of asperities is &,
then the direct asperity friction 1s obtained as: EW,.
Secondly, a thin film of lubricant is also entrapped
between the interspatial cavities of asperities. Briscoe
and Evans”? assume that such diminutive films act in
non-Newtonian shear, at the limiting Eyring shear
stress, T), thus their frictional contribution is tAz,.
Hence, boundary friction 1s obtained as

Sto = ™WAgt EW, (28)

For a ferrous oxide layer°? = 0.17 and for the
base oil used: t) = 2 MPa. An important point to
note is that lubricants used in most applications,

surface and that for a textured surface with chevron
features, respectively. Pressure perturbations are evi-
dent in the case of the latter, with magnitudes well in
excess of the average pressure of 0.15 MPa. These per-
turbations are as the result of micro-hydrodynamics,
induced by the wedge effect at the inlet to each chev-
ron feature as shown in Figure 8(d), which is not
evident in the case of the nominally smooth plate
(Figure 8(b)). The initial pressure spike at the contact
inlet in both cases is caused by the pressure-induced
Poiseuille shear flow with the commencement of
entraining motion. There is a less pronounced
Poiseuille shear at the contact entrance in the case
of the textured surface on the account of a shallower
pressure gradient due to a larger volume of lubricant.
Note that in the case of the untextured surface, the
viscous pressure falls gradually back to the atmos-
pheric value at the diverging section of the strip as
the profile of the central portion of the strip is flat
and hence there would be no contribution due to
any changes in the conjunctional profile as is the
case for a parabolic profile.°

The results in Figure 8 confirm the enhanced load-
carrying capacity of the contact with the introduced
textured features in almost the same manner as that
noted for rough articular cartilage.° The pressure dis-
tribution in Figure 8(d) is as the result of combined
micro-hydrodynamics of individual chevrons as well
as the effect of their collective effect. This collective
effect of texture forms; chevrons or dimples, is as the
result of interactions of their individual micro-hydro-
dynamics as noted by Brizmer et al.°” Therefore, the
distribution and spatial disposition of the textures as
well as the geometry of individual features play an
important role in lubricant film formation, load-car-
rying capacity and generated friction, a parametric
study of which is an important undertaking.

Numerical parametric studies

A parametric study of the chevron textures is carried
out to determine the most influential geometrical and
distribution parameters, which would enhance the
hydrodynamic load-carrying capacity, thus reducing
the chance of asperity interactions. A test matrix for
the input data is shown in Table 4, listing the range of
geometric parameters considered.

The first parameter considered is the chevron
depth. Feature depth has been reported as a key par-
ameter by Ryk et al.°* The thickness of chevrons is
also considered, so that the reported ‘optimal’ height-
to-width ratio reported by Ronen et al.'' can be inves-
tigated. It has also been reported by Etsion et al.**
that the texture density has a significant effect on
the tribological performance of the contact. The chev-
ron inclusion angle is also considered to be of interest
for the investigation. In effect, chevrons represent a
form of cross-hatched surface which is often a process
of choice for cylinder liner technology. Spencer et al.°°

have shown the influence of cross-hatch angle to the
horizontal (direction of side-leakage flow) to be opti-
mum at 28°—30°.

The distribution or the pattern of the chevrons was
also deemed worthy of investigation. A study by
Wakuda et al.” indicated that the surface texture dis-
tribution can affect the tribological properties of the
contact.

The improvement in friction for a range of the
chevrons with different depths is shown in
Figure 9(d). The chevron depth has a clear effect on
the percentage reduction in friction. A depth of 3 um
indicated the maximum predicted friction reduction.
Table 4 shows that these analyses were carried out
with a chevron thickness of 30um, representing a
height-to-width ratio of 0.1.

The results for the variation of chevron thickness
are also shown in Figure 9(a). The chevron depth was
kept at 3um for all other analyses. Therefore, the
depth-to-thickness ratio only varies in the range:
0.030.075.

The effect of chevron inclusion angle is also pre-
sented in Figure 9(c). An angle of 80° was found to
give the greatest reduction in friction. If chevron tex-
ture is to be regarded as being analogous to the usual
cross-hatch honed cylinder liner surfaces, then the
equivalent cross-hatch angle (measured with respect
to the direction of side leakage, y) would be 50° in
this case. The analysis by Spencer et al.°° for the case
of cross-hatched cylinders indicated an overall better
performance for a cross-hatch angle of around 30°.
However, this is dependent on the sliding speed and
the depth of the grooves. Furthermore, the current
analysis assumes a nominally smooth land/plateau
between the chevron features, which is not the case
in Spencer et al.°? A more detailed analysis, including
the effect of surface roughness would be required.

As well as the individual chevron properties such as
the chevron depth, thickness and inclusion angle,
there are also other group-type parameters of interest
such as the texture density and pattern. Group par-
ameters are defined as properties which are dependent
on a combination of two or more chevrons. The next
part of the parametric study is concerned with these
group parameters and their effects upon generated
friction. Increasing the texture density leads to a
greater improvement in friction. In applications such

as the piston compression ring—cylinder liner contact,
blow-by is a real problem. Increasing the texture dens-
ity could increase the amount of lubricant passage
through the ring and thus contribute to blow-by,
power loss or lubricant degradation. Therefore, one
should be cautious when applying textures with a high
density to a surface in such applications.

The results in Figure 9(b) show that chevron dens-
ity has a key effect on the percentage improvement in
friction. As the chevron texture density increases the
generated friction is reduced as it would be expected
because of a larger reservoir of lubricant entrapped.
The textured density is limited by the chevron shape
and size.

The pattern of the chevrons on the plate can also
be varied in many ways. The range of patterns to
model can of course be almost in-exhaustive.
However, to fit within the parametric study it was
decided to vary the orientation of the chevrons with
respect to the direction of sliding as well as any row of
chevrons’ staggered with respect to a preceding row
by half of a chevron’s length. Figure 10 shows eight
different patterns modelled. Pattern 1 corresponds to
that presented by Costa and Hutchings.’ As can be
seen, all patterns comprising individual chevrons of
identical geometrical attributes promote micro-hydro-
dynamic effect as already noted and described in the
case of Figure 8(c), but not in a similar overall manner
under the same operating conditions (load and sliding
speed). The position of the strip width of 1 mm is also
shown in all the figures. Three particular patterns;
identified as 1, 4 and 8 in Figure 10 provide an

improvement in friction in comparison with the
others (Figure 11), although the difference in friction
between all the patterns is less than 1%. This small
difference, however, may be regarded as quite signifi-
cant if it can be attained for applications such as com-
pression ring-to-cylinder liner system. Pattern 8
replicates the counter-pose of successive rows of chev-
rons, with a preceding row facing the direction of
sliding motion whilst the following row opposes the
same. The philosophy behind these counter-posing
rows of chevrons is that the one ahead of the sliding
strip would form a convex meniscus directing the
entrainment flow to the centre of the contact, whilst
the other at the rear of the contact would contain the
otherwise outward wake flow due to any side leakage.
This pattern was used with curvilinear chevrons by
Howell-Smith et al.,°° where a full numerical analysis
and engine test data showed 2—4% friction reduction
over a range of engine running conditions.

Experimental results

With the results of the aforementioned parametric
analysis, it was decided to create four types of chevron
textures. The chevron parameters chosen for this pur-
pose are: a chevron thickness of 30 um (as the vari-
ation on the generated friction was caused by
increasing density rather than any other effect, see
section ‘Numerical parametric studies’).
Furthermore, by keeping the laser beam width for a
chevron leg thickness of 30 um the production time of
the samples was significantly reduced. A chevron

depth of 3 um was chosen to adhere to the aforemen-
tioned height-to-width ratio of 0.1, noted to be an
optimum ratio by Etsion and Sher.**

Although the results of parametric study for the
chevron inclusion angle indicated an optimum
values of 80° (representing a 50° equivalent cross-
hatch angle), it was decided to opt for an inclusion
angle of 120°. The main reason for this was that the
ultimate motivation for this research is to use the
eventual configuration from the current study
for use in advanced cylinder liner technology of high
performing engines. Additionally, it has been noted
in practice that features with shallower cross-
hatch angle perform better in engine applications
which, as noted above, has been confirmed by
the numerical predictions in Spencer et al.
Different distributions of chevrons are used
(Table 5, Figure 12).

Numerical simulation of these various patterns
ylelds the percentage reductions in friction with
respect to an un-textured nominally smooth surface.

The new chevron patterns show reduction in fric-
tion of around 4% with respect to the original pattern
based on that of Costa and Hutchings.”

All the new patterns and that in Costa and
Hutchings’ were manufactured and subjected to test-
ing (see Appendix 2 for the test protocol) using the
precision slider rig, described in __ section
‘Reciprocating sliding contacts’.

The initial step was to validate the numerical ana-
lysis, thus gain confidence in the result of parametric
analysis. This comparison is shown in Figure 14(a).
The region containing the chevron textures is high-
lighted in the figure. A reduction in predicted as well
as measured friction is noted as the sliding strip enters
the textured region. A sharper drop in friction is noted

in the case of measured results at the onset of textured
region. This indicates that in practice a_ lesser
Poiseuille shear exists at contact inlet. This means
that there must be a greater volume of lubricant in
the inlet region of the contact than the just flooded
condition assumed in the numerical analysis.
Nevertheless, an overall good agreement is noted
between the numerical prediction and that measured.

The next step was to measure friction for the vari-
ous patterns in Table 5. The results are shown in
terms of friction reduction with respect to an un-
textured surface in Figure 14(b). All textured patterns
show significant reduction in friction relative to an
untreated surface. There is a difference in an initial
drop in friction between different textured patterns
at the onset of entry into the textured region. As
already noted, this is mainly due to Poiseuille shear
on the account of encountered inlet pressure gradient
in the presence of identical measured sliding speed
(thus almost the same nominal Couette shear) and
load (see also ‘Concluding remarks’).

Concluding remarks

It is shown through numerical analysis and precision
measurement that for low sliding motion textured sur-
faces of suitable geometry, pattern and distribution
can induce micro-hydrodynamic pressure perturb-
ations, thus enhance lubricant film thickness. This
leads to a reduction in generated conjunctional fric-
tion. It is also shown that various texture geometrical
attributes and distribution can be used to ‘optimise’
the prevailing regime of lubrication, thus reducing
friction. It is clear that a choice of these pertinent
parameters depends on the application in mind and
the operating conditions such as sliding speed and
conjunctional load. Therefore, ‘optimisation’ would
be application dependent.

In particular, the study shows that lubricant reten-
tion in the created micro-reservoirs as well as pressure
perturbations at the inlet conjunction can result in
differing extent of effective micro-wedge effect,
which is also crucially dependent on the supply of
the lubricant at the contact inlet. In practice, such
as in light-to-medium loaded reversal region of
piston—cylinder liner contact in transition from com-
pression to power stroke, supply of inlet meniscus to
the contact cannot be controlled on the account of
high surface temperatures in the combustion cham-
ber. There is also modal deformation of contiguous
surfaces, such as the piston compression ring and the
cylinder liner*? which deviate from their ideal circum-
ferential conformity. Therefore, unlike mechanical
seals and rings where entrance wedge geometry can
be controlled to a certain extent as well as a fully
flooded inlet, optimisation to the degree of minutiae
in cylinder technology would be cost inefficient so
long as any significant reduction can be achieved in
line with the cost of manufacture. The study shows

that texturing has the potential to meet the practical
requirements, but as shown by Howell-Smith et al.°°
not to the extent indicated under controlled and rela-
tively ideal laboratory conditions.

configurations. For this purpose a test protocol was
devised. The load cells were calibrated before each set
of tests. The contacting surface topography of the
strip and the floating plate specimen were measured
using an Alicona Infinite Focus microscope with a
nominal measurement resolution of the order of
wavelength of light propagation. The strip and the
floating plate specimen were then mounted onto the
slider test rig, care was taken to ensure proper align-
ment was attained for all tests. A controlled volume of
base oil (0.15mL) was applied to the flat liner plate
using a hypodermic syringe. No boundary active spe-
cies are present in the base oil as these would adsorb
to the conjunctional surfaces and cannot be easily and
reliably removed, thus affecting repeatable testing
conditions. An initial running-in period was allowed
prior to each test. Each test consisted of a single pass
over the textured area. A settling time of Smin
between successive runs were allowed in order to
allow any rise in temperature to be dissipated. For
each textured case 15 runs were carried out. After
each test the surfaces of the strip and the floating
plate were again measured.

Appendix 3
Load intensity

The aim of the analysis and testing with the slider rig
is to develop texture patterns and geometry for ulti-
mate use in piston-cylinder system at and in the vici-
nity of the top dead centre reversal. Therefore, load
and sliding speed variation used in the current analy-
sis Should be representative of conditions encountered
for the intended application. Figure 15 shows the
operating conditions for the Honda CRF 450 single
cylinder motocross motorsport normally aspirated

2000r/min with partial application of throttle
(yielding a torque of 30Nm) on a test bed. The
engine and test bed arrangement are described by
Gore et al.*? Figure 4 shows the nominal calculated
piston sliding speed, using™®

The figure shows that the part of engine cycle
where the sliding speed is representative of the
slider bearing kinematics is around the piston rever-
sals, +10° about the reversal position. The contact
load variation is also in the figure, indicating that
load intensity (per unit area of contact of piston
compression ring) is in the range shown in Table 6.
The load intensity for the thin slider strip in the
slider rig is also stated in Table 6. Therefore, the
load intensity for the studied conditions is quite
representative of the reversal region for engine con-
ditions at low piston sliding speed and at partial
