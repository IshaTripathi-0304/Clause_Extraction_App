A systematic review of the effect of pre-test rest
duration on toe and ankle systolic blood pressure

measurements

Sean Sadler , Vivienne Chuter and Fiona Hawke

Abstract

Background: Measurement of toe and ankle blood pressure is commonly used to evaluate peripheral vascular
status, yet the pre-test rest period is inconsistent in published studies and among practitioners, and could affect
results. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate all research that has investigated the effect of different
periods of pre-test rest on toe and ankle systolic blood pressure.

Methods: The following databases were searched up to April 2012: Medline (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1947),
CINAHL (from 1937), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (from 1800). No language or
publication restrictions were applied. Eighty-eight content experts and researchers in the field were contacted by
email to assist in the identification of published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. Studies evaluating the effect of
two or more pre-test rest durations on toe or ankle systolic blood pressure were eligible for inclusion. No restrictions

were placed on participant characteristics or the method of blood pressure measurement. Outcomes included toe or
ankle systolic blood pressure and adverse effects. Abstracts identified from the search terms were independently
assessed by two reviewers for potential inclusion.

Results: 1658 abstracts were identified by electronic searching. Of the 88 content experts and researchers in the
field contacted by email a total of 33 replied and identified five potentially relevant studies. No studies were

eligible for inclusion.

Conclusions: There is no evidence of the effect of different periods of pre-test rest duration on toe and ankle
systolic blood pressure measurements. Rigorous trials evaluating the effect of different durations of pre-test rest

are required to direct clinical practice and research.

Background

Duration of pre-test rest time for blood pressure meas-
urement varies markedly in the literature, ranging from
5 minutes [1-3] to 30 minutes [4-8]. This range of pre-test
rest times reflects inconsistencies between clinical guide-
lines. Additionally, current National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines [9] do not pro-
vide definitive guidance on optimum pre-test rest duration
for toe, ankle, or brachial systolic blood pressure mea-
surements. Brachial systolic blood pressure, when measured
in a supine [10] or seated [11] position continues to fall
throughout the first 10 minutes of pre-test resting.

Measurement of blood pressure before resting systolic
blood pressure is achieved would cause a falsely elevated
reading. Similar changes may also occur in lower limb
blood pressure and may affect the measurements routinely
used in lower limb vascular assessment.

The length of pre-test rest time is not only an important
factor for stabilisation of blood pressure, reliability of the
measurement, and accurate diagnosis of peripheral arterial
disease (PAD), but also for clinical efficiency. Mohler II
and colleagues [12] surveyed 897 clinicians and found that
the principal factor limiting office utilisation of Ankle
Brachial Indices (ABIs) was time restraints. Similarly,
Chen, Lawford, Shah, Pham and Bower [13] found in a
cross sectional survey of 92 Western Australian Podiatrists

that time restrictions were the underlying reason for
clinicians’ infrequent use of ABIs. The lack of clinical
utilisation of vascular assessments is understandable
when considering some studies suggest clinicians should
wait 30 minutes before performing an ABI, which then
takes an additional 5 minutes [14]. Guidelines that
provide clinicians with an efficient protocol for per-
forming non-invasive vascular assessments could im-
prove their usage.

This systematic review aims to evaluate all research that
has investigated the effect of different periods of pre-test
rest time on toe and ankle systolic blood pressure mea-
surements in humans. Determination of the shortest
duration of pre-test rest that produces both valid and
reliable results may improve clinical efficiency, increase
vascular assessment utilisation, and guide future research.
This systematic review has been published as conference
proceedings [15].

Methods

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

All studies measuring toe or ankle systolic blood pressure in
any person after two or more periods of pre-test rest were
eligible for inclusion. We planned to include all methods
of blood pressure measurement, including automated or
manually operated devices, and blood pressures measured
from any toe and from either the dorsalis pedis or pos-
terior tibial arteries. We excluded exercise stress tests,
post-occlusive hyperaemia tests, and studies of toe or
ankle systolic blood pressure measurement that used
only one pre-test rest period.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was change in toe and ankle
systolic blood pressure over time and the secondary
outcome was adverse events associated with taking
the measurements.

Search strategy
The following databases were searched up to April 2012:

1) MEDLINE (from 1946) (Additional file 1 - MEDLINE
search strategy);

2) EMBASE (from 1947) (Additional file 2 - EMBASE
search strategy);

3) CINAHL (from 1937) (Additional file 3 - CINAHL
search strategy); and

4) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) (from 1800) (Additional file 4 - CENTRAL
search strategy).

Studies identified from the search terms were not subject
to language or publication restrictions.

Other sources

Eighty-eight content experts and researchers in the field
were contacted via email and asked to identify potentially
relevant studies.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors (SS and FH) independently assessed
titles and abstracts (where available) of all studies identified
by the search. No disagreements occurred while screening
for inclusion so no arbitration by a third reviewer (VC) was
needed. Data extraction was planned to be conducted
by one reviewer (SS) using a pilot-tested form and to be
cross-checked by a second reviewer (FH).

As no gold standard appraisal tool exists for studies
investigating measurement agreement, we planned to
assess risk of bias of included studies using the QAREL
tool [16] and the completeness of reporting using the
STROBE tool [17].

Results
Electronic searches retrieved a total of 1658 citations
(555 from MEDLINE; 781 from EMBASE; 246 from
CINAHL; and 76 from CENTRAL). After screening all
identified studies at a title and abstract level, none was
eligible for inclusion therefore no full text versions of
studies were required. Thirty three content experts and re-
searchers in the field (Additional file 5 - Experts contacted)
replied to our email (Additional file 6 - Email sent to
experts) and identified five potentially relevant studies, none
of which was eligible for inclusion. Two ongoing studies by
Chuter and Casey (2012a) (unpublished observations) and
Chuter and Casey (2012b) (unpublished observations) were
identified but no data were available for inclusion in this
review (Additional file 7 - PRIMSA flow diagram).
Studies were excluded because the researchers investigated
the effects of post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia on rest
time; the effects of exercise stress tests on rest time; and
blood pressures were measured after one period of rest time.

Discussion

No study has evaluated the effect of different durations
of pre-test rest on toe or ankle systolic blood pressure
measurements.

Although there have been no studies investigating the
effect of different durations of pre-test rest time on toe
and ankle systolic blood pressure, there is some evidence
for the effects of different pre-test rest durations on brachial
systolic blood pressure. Based on the studies investigating
the effects of different periods of pre-test rest duration
on brachial systolic blood pressure, it appears that the
hydrostatic effects of gravity on blood pressure are re-
duced after approximately 10 minutes of either supine
[10] or chair-seated rest [11] and no further reduction
is gained by a longer rest period [18].

Limitations and overall completeness

Due to the lack of research evidence, this systematic
review cannot provide a clear recommendation for the
ideal pre-test rest duration for measuring toe or ankle
systolic blood pressures. The overall completeness of
this review was strengthened by thoroughly searching
electronic databases, and communicating extensively,
in English and non-English language, with dozens of
national and international content experts and researchers
in the field. This is the first systematic review to investigate
the effects of pre-test rest duration on toe and ankle systolic
blood pressure measurements, therefore no agreements or
disagreements with other studies or reviews occurred.

More research is also needed to determine the minimum
number of participants needed to detect clinically import-
ant differences between periods of pre-test rest duration
when measuring toe and ankle systolic blood pressure.

Conclusion

There is no evidence to determine if different periods of
pre-test rest duration affect toe or ankle systolic blood pres-
sure. This review highlights the urgent need for rigorously
designed research evaluating the effect of pre-test rest dur-
ation on toe or ankle systolic blood pressures when mea-
sured after at least two periods of pre-test rest. Outcomes
should include toe or ankle systolic blood pressure and
adverse effects associated with taking the measurements.
