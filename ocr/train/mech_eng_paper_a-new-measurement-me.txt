Abstract

This article presents a novel method to measure unbalanced moments in a two-axis gimbaled seeker commonly believed to
seviously influence the tracking accuracy and stabilizing capability. This method enables individual measurement of unbal-
anced moments, and judgment of the seeker’s status—balanced or not. Furthermore, an instrument is designed based on this
method and calibrated. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a simulation. The experimental results
show a satisfied level of accuracy the measurements have. This work forms a basis for the further development of a more
stabilized gimbaled seeker with less induced vibration and consumed power.

Keywords: gimbaled seeker; weight sensors; measurement; unbalanced

1. Introduction

Gimbaled seekers have found wide applications in
modern advanced tactical missiles. Used to track the
target and stabilize the antenna’s pointing vector, the
system is mainly of a two-axis type inclusive of an
inner and an outer gimbal!'?!, However, disturbance
torques are always generated by the mass imbalance
and the gimbal geometry during it moving and vi-
brating?’*!. The induced disturbance torque is known
as the unbalanced moment.

Presence of unbalanced moments leads to a con-
siderable reduction in the motor torques, thus causing
position errors and even downgrading the seeker’s
tracking accuracy and stabilizing ability'*”!. The most
popular tool to eliminate the troubles is to counteract
them with counterweights'**!. It is the process, in
which, an extra mass is added to the gimbal at a spe-
cific locations to shift its center of gravity (CG) to
the center of rotation.

However, there exist two unbalanced moments on
other two axes of each gimbal except the rotational
axis. The four unbalanced moments cannot be meas-
ured individually and directly, for the inner and outer

gimbals are connected in series, which is naturally
accompanied by coupling effects. Therefore, it is
almost impossible to accurately determine the added
mass and its location for each gimbal in applying the
counterweights, which makes it necessary to have
resort to estimation and/or experience at present!’”!,

Rather too limited work has been devoted to the
measurement of the unbalanced moments of a gim-
baled seeker. In space electronics, there was intro-
duced the idea of orienting the gimbal axes at 45° to
the horizontal and measuring the changes in horizon-
tal CG position as the gimbal rotates about its axis'”!.
C. L. Lin and Y. H. Hsiao built the model of distur-
bance moment induced by seeker’s mass imbalance
according to the squares of the missile body’s angular
rate, angular acceleration and lateral acceleration!''!.
From the above-cited work, it is clear that to measure
the unbalanced moments in a two-axis gimbaled
seeker remains challenging.

This study proposes a brand-new method to meas-
ure the unbalanced moments in each gimbal for a
two-axis gimbal seeker. On the basis of the method, a
measuring instrument with three weight sensors is
designed and calibrated. Then simulations are pre-
formed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
method. Finally, some experiments are carried out on
the instrument with the measurement errors dis-
cussed.

2. Measurement Method
2.1. Measurement concept

Fig.l shows the schematic representation of a
gimbaled seeker, which illustrates both gimbals con-
nected in series with the outer gimbal mounted on the
base and the inner gimbal on the outer gimbal. The
antenna, not shown, is disposed on the inner gimbal.
Let y, z be the rotational axes of the outer and inner
gimbals respectively; O the center of rotation; 2, the
angular displacement of the outer gimbal relative to
the base and J; the angular displacement of the inner
gimbal relative to the outer gimbal.

Inner gimbal

Fig.l Scheme of a gimbaled seeker.

In order to balance the gimbaled seeker, the coun-
terweight should be so designed as to shift the CG of
each gimbal to the center of rotation. To do this, a
method has been developed beforehand to predeter-
mine the accurate unbalanced moments. By this
method, the gimbaled seeker to be measured is
placed on a platform supported by three weight sen-
sors. The connection between the measurement plat-
form and each sensor is designed to be of one
point-contact and unconstrained type. This is to en-
sure that the whole weight of the gimbal acts on the
sensors without any force from other directions and
also the sensors’ force-bearing points do not subject
to changes in the measurement process. The unbal-
anced moments of the gimbal are determined by
measuring the change of three weight sensors’ out-
puts when the inner and outer gimbals rotate by dif-
ferent angular orientations. If the gimbals are in bal-
ance, the outputs from all weight sensors will not
change no matter which angular orientations the ro-
tating gimbals take.

Fig.2 illustrates the principles of the measurement
method. The coordinate frame O'y’z' is parallel to
Oyz. The three sensors’ force-bearing points are de-
noted by the coordinates in O'y’z’, 1. e. D\(0,0) , Do(2,
Z>) , D3(y3, Z3) respectively.

Fig.2 Principles of a measurement method.

The measurement involves the following steps:

Step 1 Place a gimbal seeker on the measure-
ment platform.

Step 2 Calibrate the coordinates of the sensors’
force-bearing points D(y2, Z2) and D3(y3, Z3).

Step 3. Record the three sensors’ outputs when
the two gimbals are held at the zero angular orienta-
tion.

Step 4 Record the three sensors’outputs when
the outer gimbal is held at the zero angular orienta-
tion and the inner gimbal rotates by two angular dis-
placements +/; (A; > 0).

Step 5 Record the three sensors’ outputs when
the inner gimbal is held at the zero angular orienta-
tion and the outer gimbal rotates by two angular dis-
placements +/, (A, > 0).

Step 6 Calculate the unbalanced moments.

2.2. Calculation of unbalanced moments

In Step 4, according to the principles of moment
balance, the moment generated by the total weight of
the inner and outer gimbals about the point O' must
equal the sum of each sensor’s pressure multiplied by
the force arm from the sensor’s force-bearing point to
the point O’. Thus the moment balance equations
about the point O’ along y’-axis can be obtained.

Furthermore, the unbalanced moment of an inner
gimbal can be mathematically expressed by

1
G.x, =———-[(P,,, —P +
im“ 2sin/, [( 2zp oan V2
(Pap — Pan )y3] (1)
1
G. y. = —————_[(2P,. -P,.. -
Vi 1 —cosA,) 27z 2zp

Pym WV» + (2P,, 7 Prop 7 Pron V3 ] (2)

where G; is the weight of the inner gimbal; x;, y; are
the CG offsets of the inner gimbal along x-and y-axis
respectively; Pi(j = 1, 2,3; k =z, p, n; /=z, p, n) is
the sensor output at position D; when the outer gim-
bal rotates by & angular displacements and the inner
gimbal by / angular displacement; z, p, n denote the
gimbal at fixed state and the gimbal rotates by /,(;)

and -/,(-/;)angular displacements respectively.

From Eqs. (1)-(2), the unbalanced moments of the
inner gimbal are generated by the CG offsets along x-
and y-axis while the offset along z-axis does not af-
fect the unbalanced moment because the inner gimbal
rotates about z-axis.

Also the moment balance equations about the point
O' along z’-axis can be obtained from Step 5. From
them, the unbalanced moment for outer gimbal can
be mathematically expressed by

1
G,x, = Pin PP +
o%o 2sin A, (Pam sap V2

PP. —P +——_
( 3zn s2p )¥3 | 2sin A,

G+62,-——
2(1—cos A, )
(22, — Pro — Pyuz )Z2 +
(2P,, — Pry — Py )Zo | (4)

where G, is the weight of the outer gimbal; x,, Z, are
the CG offsets of the outer gimbal along x-and z-axis
respectively and z; is the CG offset of the inner gim-
bal along z-axis.

From Eqs.(3)-(4), the unbalanced moment of the
outer gimbal is generated by the CG offset of outer
gimbal along x-axis and the CG offset of the two
gimbals along z-axis while the offset along y-axis has
nothing to do with the unbalanced moment as it ro-
tates about y-axis.

From the analysis and by the above-mentioned, the
unbalanced moments of the inner gimbals, G;x; and
Gy;, and the outer gimbals, Gox, and Gz; + GoZ>, can
be calculated from the measurement results. It can
also be seen that the location of the seeker on the
measurement platform exerts no effect on the results
of the calculated unbalanced moment.

By using this method, the unbalanced moment
about each axis can not only be measured accurately,
but also be judged if a two-axis gimbaled seeker is
balanced.

3. Calibration Method

In using the proposed method, the sensors need to
be calibrated to know how large a pressure should be
applied. The weight sensors are made of aluminum
and U-shaped slots are cut to transfer the maximal
tension to the vibrating strip when a force is applied
to the end of the frame. The sensors can be calibrated
through measuring the sensors’ outputs under certain
static loads''*'?!, By recording the loads and the sen-
sor’s outputs corresponded thereto, the two sets of
data can be related to form a calibration matrix.

Besides the aforesaid sensors, the coordinates of
sensors’ force-bearing points, D2 (2, Z2) and D3(_ 3,
Z3), are required to calibrate. To do this, a steel ball is
placed on each of the three different round holes in
the measurement platform, the locations of each
hole’s center in the frame O'y’z’ being ( ya, Za) , (Vb;
Zp) ’ (Ve, Ze) ( where Za> Zp, Za> Ze and Yo Vo> Ya )
respectively. The diameter of the steel ball should be
slightly bigger than that of the holes to allow the
center of the ball coincident with the center of the
holes horizontally.

The mass of the steel balls and their relative posi-
tions of the holes in the O'y’z' frame are predeter-
mined by means of a balance and a microscope re-
spectively. According to the principles of moment
balance, the coordinates of D, and D; can be defined
as

J. = Gila — Fy, (Va —Y_.)=

(P53. — Fc Va — Mp) (5)

V3 = Ga [Poa — Foe (Va — Yb) =
(Po. — Fay Va — Ye) (6)

2, = Gal, — Pp (Za — 20) -
(P32 — Fy Za — Zp I/F (7)

23 = GalPo, — Poe Za — 2p) -
(Fy, — Foy M24 — 20) PF (8)

P= (Py, — Fy WP 5a — P30)

(Fo. — Foy (Fa — P30) (9)

where G,, is the weight of the ball and F;; (7 =1, 2, 3,
s =a, b, c) the sensor output at position of D; when
the ball is placed at the position s.

4. Validation Through Simulation

In order to validate the proposed method, a simu-
lation model of the measurement instrument with an
unbalanced gimbaled seeker is built in Automatic
Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical System (ADAMS)
software. Then the unbalanced moments can be cal-
culated with the software. In the simulation, the co-
ordinate system 1s set to follow the definition in Fig.2
and the accuracy of each sensor is specified to be 1
mg. According to Eqs.(1)-(4), the measurement errors
of the unbalanced moment decrease with the increase
of the angular displacements 4,(/;). Since the maxi-
mal angular displacement of the two gimbals is 30°,
both A, and 4; are set to be 30°.

The whole simulation process involves the steps in
Section 2.1. According to the sensor outputs from
each step and Eqs.(1)-(4), the unbalanced moments
for each gimbal can be obtained. Table 1 shows the
comparison between the calculated and the measured
unbalanced moments. It can be discovered that the

measured values are very close to the calculated ones
with the measurement errors less than | g-cm, which
evidences the effectiveness of the proposed method.

5. System Design and Experimental Results

Based on the presented method, an instrument for
measuring unbalanced moments is developed. In it,
the sensor’s load accuracy of each strain gage 1s 1/10
000 and the measurement range is 0-1 kg. The sensor
outputs are sampled by a 16-bit analog/digital (AD)
data acquisition card and the final results are attained
by averaging 100 data, which have been processed
by the inter function of the AD card.

5.1. Calibration results

In calibrating weight sensors, the loads and the
sensor outputs corresponded thereto are recorded
when the weights up to | kg are applied to the end of
frame and, by using the least square method, the rela-
tional expressions of three sensors can be described

by

v, 10.003 30 0.001 15
v, |=| 10.000 02 |m+] 0.000 72 (10)
V3 10.000 14 0.001 06

where v}, v2 and v3 denote each sensor’s out-
put(V)and m the applied load(kg). The three weight
sensors are shown to possess excellent linearity and
repeatability from a series of measurement tests.

In calibrating the coordinates of the sensors’
force-bearing points, the accuracy of the balance and
the microscope ts so high, 1. e. within 1 mg and | um
respectively, that the errors from the two instruments
can be neglected. In order to decrease the calibration
errors, the final calibration results are obtained by
averaging the results from repeated measurements.
Table 2 lists the calibration results after digital filter
processing in eight tests.

According to the theoretical analysis, it 1s reason-
able that the calibration results fluctuate within 1 mm
by using the sensors with the accuracy of 100 mg.
From Table 2, it can be seen that the range within
measurement data vary is about 0. 5 mm. This is far
better than the given value.

5.2. Measurement results and discussions

After calibrating each sensor and the coordinates
of sensors’ force-bearing points, a two-axis gimbaled
seeker to be measured is placed on the measurement
platform and tested according to the steps specified
in Section 2. 1. The test is repeated eighteen times

with the results shown in Fig.3.

By the error estimation theory!'*'®!, the measure-

ment errors are calculated when the confidence level
is 99. 7%. The results are listed below:

| AG,x;| = 3.69 g-cm
| AG; | =13.98 g -cm
| AGox | = 3.83 g-cm
| A(Gizi+ GoZo) | = 7.91 g-cm

From Eqs.(1)-(4), the maximum measurement er-
rors of unbalanced moments are

| AG,x;| = 3.34 g-cm
| AG; | = 21.29 g-cm
| AGox, | = 4.18 g-cm

----$$$$----$$$$----
No.1 Yu Shuang et al. / Chinese Journal of Aeronautics 23(2010) 117-122

| AC Gizj+ GoZo) | = 16.49 g-cm

The permissible measurement error of the instru-
ment for each unbalanced moment is set to be 50
g - cm, and it can be seen that most of the experiment
errors are well below the specified value. This means
the experiment results are satisfied. The measurement
errors are affected by several factors: the sensor’s
accuracy, the coordinates of sensors’ force-bearing
points, the angular displacements of each gimbal and
environmental variants, such as vibration, radiation,
wind and air-stream, etc. Among them, the sensor’s
accuracy gets overwhelming position over others, for
it accounts for more than 86%; and, what’s more, it
affects of itself the calibration accuracy of the coor-
dinates of sensors’ force-bearing points. Therefore,
the sensors play a decisive role in the measurement
instrument.

From Fig.3, it can be observed that though the
measured values fluctuate in a broad range, they are
still constrained to an acceptable extent. Table 3 lists
the results by averaging the measurement values and
calculating the total unbalance about y-axis and
Z-aXxIS.

The unbalanced moments in Table 3 provide the
data required to determine the amounts and locations
of added weights for a two-axis gimbaled seeker,
which enables the unbalanced moments to be limited
to an allowable value.

Table 3 Unbalanced moments of a gimbaled seeker

Gimbal Condition Value(g:cm)
Along x-axis about z-axis (G;x;) 10.98
Inner Along y-axis about z-axis (Gj) 42.53
Total unbalance about z-axis 43.92
Along x-axis about y-axis (GX) 60.37
Outer Along z-axis about y-axis (G;z;+ GZ) 10.68
Total unbalance about y-axis 61.31

Both the simulation and the experiment have borne
out the effectiveness of the proposed method. Never-
theless, there is left a problem that the measurement
errors, satisfied though, may not be qualified for the
higher performances of a seeker as a result of the
limited sensor’s accuracy of the strain gage load. One
way to contain the problem is to employ other type of
sensors, such as electromagnetic one, capable of
measuring force to within about 0.000 1%. This con-
stitutes one of contents of our future work.

6. Conclusions

This article has advanced a new method to meas-
ure unbalanced moments in a two-axis gimbaled
seeker. It is superior to other counterparts in that each
unbalanced moment can be measured directly and
individually although the inner and outer gimbals are

connected in series, and the seeker’s location on the
measurement platform cuts no ice with the measure-
ment results. Furthermore, a measurement instrument
is designed based on this method with its calibration
methods studied.

The proposed method is verified against the simu-
lation results in ADAMS software. And then the
measurement tests are carried out on the designed
instrument. The results show that the errors of most
experiment data are well under the specified permis-
sible ones. Admittedly, however, satisfied though the
measurement accuracy may be, it might be insuffi-
cient for the higher performances of a seeker owing
to the limited sensor’s own accuracy. To solve the
problem is one of the objectives of our future work.
Anyway, the research has laid the foundation for us
to push ahead with the project to develop
high-performance gimbaled seekers.
