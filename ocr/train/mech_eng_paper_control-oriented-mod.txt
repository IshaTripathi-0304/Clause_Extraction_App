Abstract

This article presents a parameterized configuration modeling approach to develop a 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) rigid-body
model for air-breathing hypersonic vehicle (AHV). The modeling process involves the parameterized configuration design, 1n-
viscous hypersonic aerodynamic force calculation and scramjet engine modeling. The parameters are designed for air-
frame-propulsion integration configuration, the aerodynamic force calculation is based on engineering experimental methods,
and the engine model is acquired from gas dynamics and quasi-one dimensional combustor calculations. Multivariate fitting 1s
used to obtain analytical equations for aerodynamic force and thrust. Furthermore, the fitting accuracy is evaluated by relative
error (RE). Trim results show that the model can be applied to the investigation of control method for AHV during the cruise
phase. The modeling process integrates several disciplines such as configuration design, aerodynamic calculation, scramjet mod-
eling and control method. Therefore the modeling method makes it possible to conduct AHV aerodynamics/propulsion/control
integration design.

Keywords: flight dynamics; hypersonic; AHV model; parameterized configuration design; aerodynamics/propulsion integration

1. Introduction

With a large altitude-velocity flight envelope,
wild-varying disturbances and complicated environ-
ment, the near space hypersonic vehicle becomes
strong coupling, fast time-varying, highly nonlinear
and great uncertain. Integration of attitude control,
engine thrust regulation and guidance control are re-
quired'"!, Therefore, the development of reasonable
air-breathing hypersonic vehicle (AHV) model is in-
evitable.

Two models are widely used for hypersonic control
research. One is winged-cone model developed by
NASA Langley Research Center and opened to public

in 1990 (that is generic hypersonic vehicle (GHV)
model). This model aims to develop a manned, hori-
zontal takeoff and landing, single-stage-to-orbit
(SSTO), air-breathing launch vehicle. It covers a large
operational range from subsonic to hypersonic, and the
aerodynamic data is sophisticated from both wind
tunnel tests and aerodynamic preliminary analysis sys-
tem (APAS). This mathematical model is applied to
reducing the vehicle trim drag force, developing the
guidance and control strategies and evaluating the ve-
hicle performances!**,

The other one is air-breathing hypersonic flight ve-
hicle (AHFV), which is a two-dimensional vertical
model based on gas dynamics and computational fluid
dynamics (CFD). AHFV is used by Multidisciplinary
Flight Dynamics and Control Laboratory at California
State University, Los Angeles (CSULA), to research
aerodynamics/propulsion coupling effect and control
methodology, also known as CSULA-GHV model!®*!,
The widely used 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) (plus
flexibility) nonlinear model for the longitudinal dy-

namics of a generic scramjet hypersonic vehicle is also
utilized by Bolender, et al.!'°""!,

However, the winged-cone model does not have
aerodynamics/propulsion integration configuration,
which is a general characteristic for hypersonic wave
rider. Only the effect of hypersonic velocity is re-
flected in the dynamic equations. Although the 6 DOF
model has been developed, it is usually reduced to
longitudinal model for control algorithms study. The
CSULA-GHV model emphasizes the aerodynam-
ics/propulsion integration design, but the model is lim-
ited in vertical plane which is mainly used for scramjet
modeling research and only simple control method is
discussed.

Besides, with fixed configuration, existing models
cannot reflect interaction between aerodynamic profile
and propulsion performance, so they cannot be used to
conduct research on aerodynamics/propulsion/control
integration. Therefore, we present a method to develop
6 DOF rigid-body model for AHV using parameterized
configuration approach. Trim calculation results show
that AHV model can be applied to the control algo-
rithm research for AHV during the cruise phase. The
modeling process integrates several disciplines such as
configuration design, aerodynamic calculation, scram-
jet modeling and control method. Therefore the mod-
eling method makes it possible to conduct AHV aero-
dynamics/propulsion/control integration design. In
addition, some advanced control actuator (vector con-
trol, direct force control and variable centroid control,
etc.) can also be introduced into the modeling process,
so it is flexible to explore and verify varieties of con-
trol methods for AHV.

The modeling procedure for AHV is as follow. After
selecting the general parameters and flight conditions
for target vehicle, the aircraft aerodynamic profile and
engine shape are obtained through parameterized de-

sign. Then, the aerodynamics/propulsion data is calcu-
lated by inviscous hypersonic aerodynamic force cal-
culation and the quasi-one dimensional combustor
calculation. Finally, the model is verified by trim cal-
culation.

2. Parameterized Configuration Design

For AHV, the magnitude of thrust is at the same or-
der with drag force. In order to reduce the drag and
obtain the thrust as large as possible, the highly inte-
grated aerodynamics/propulsion system is required.
With integrated design, the incoming flow can be
pre-compressed by the forebody before getting into the
engine inlet. The afterbody plays a role as an “outside
nozzle” to enable further expansion of burned propel-
lants. The high temperature gas stream pressed on the
undersurface of the afterbody causes further lift which
has great impact on aerodynamic performance of
AHV!?!,

Parameterized configuration approach determines
the geometric configuration of AHV by setting a series
of parameters. Table 1 lists some parameters. With
these parameters, the PLOT3D format data file 1s gen-
erated by self-developed geometric configuration pro-
gram. AHV 3D profile is shown in Fig.1. Configura-
tion modification can be achieved easily through reset-
ting corresponding parameters in the program. For the
models from CFD software, it 1s inevitable to re-mesh
the vehicle and flow field. The presented method could
avoid these troubles which brings a great convenience
at the conceptual stage of AHV design. What’s more,
this allows us to utilize the multidisciplinary design
optimization (MDO) methods which can combine
AHV aerodynamics and propulsion design to get the
best overall performance.

3. General Parameters and Flight Conditions

The general parameters and flight conditions of
AHV should be determined before aerodynamic and
thrust calculation. A few parameters can be obtained
from the similar vehicle!’®!, but most of them need to
be reassigned through times of iterations based on the
mission object function from initially estimated values.
The results are shown in Table 2.

The setting of flight conditions decides the flight
envelope which is critical to the calculation of
aerodynamics/propulsion.

AHV model is mainly established for guidance and
control investigation during the cruise phase. The mag-
nitude of angle of attack (AOA) is limited within a
typical range, and so are the altitude and velocity. On
the other hand, because AHV has aerodynamics/pro-
pulsion integration configuration, the bank to turn
(BTT) control technology has to be adopted. Thus the
sideslip angle magnitude is constrained within permit-
ted threshold. Table 3 gives the resultant flight condi-
tions.

4. Aerodynamics and Propulsion Modeling

4.1. Partitioning of aerodynamic force and thrust

The areodynamics/propulsion integration configura-
tion brings strong couplings between aerodynamics
and propulsion system. To understand their interaction
better, it is necessary to partition aerodynamic force
and thrust. AHV is divided into aerodynamics system
and propulsion system. Both of them are partitioned
with the approach in Ref.[9]. The details are shown in
Fig.2. The aerodynamics system includes forebody,
external compression part of inlet, wings, empennage,
the upper surface and side surface of the vehicle, the
cowl of the engine. The propulsion system includes the
flow passage inside the engine and the nozzle.

4.2. Inviscid hypersonic aerodynamics calculation

During conceptual design period, proper prediction
of aerodynamic performance is of great importance
because wind tunnel tests are highly time- and
money-consuming. The CFD software such as Fluent
is commonly used in the calculation of hypersonic
aerodynamics because of its high precision. But it is
still time-consuming and not suitable for exploratory
design research of AHV. Even the geometric configu-
ration parameters change slightly, the aircraft has to be
re-drawn, so a simpler and more effective approximate
aerodynamic calculation method is in need.

During the hypersonic flight, most aerodynamic
force comes from inviscid hypersonic flow. Particu-
larly, aerodynamic force and moment could be pre-
dicted through inviscid flow analysis. This method
could be applied in parameterized modeling to reduce
the modeling period.

Different methods are used to estimate the pressure
coefficient for airframe and wings, according to the

situations of the windward sides and the leeward sides.
Considering the missions, flight environment and ve-
hicle configuration, this article adopts the Dahlem-Bu-
ck method for the windward sides of airframe, and the
Prandtl-Meyer method for the leeward sides of air-
frame. The cone method and expansion-wave method
are used for windward and leeward sides for wings
respectively!'”!, Parts of the results are shown in

Fig.4 Lateral aerodynamic characteristics of AHV.

As depicted from the above figures, aerodynamic
characteristics of this AHV have the following fea-
tures:

The longitudinal static stability derivative 0C,,/0a 1s
larger than 0, demonstrating that the longitudinal mode
of AHV is statically instable; the dihedral derivative
OC, /0f is also larger than 0, which means that the roll-
ing mode of AHV is statically instable; the yawing
stability derivative OC,,/0f is larger than 0, indicating
that the yawing mode of AHV 1s statically stable. The

lift to drag ratio is relatively high, which means AHV
has good aerodynamic efficiency.

4.3. Scramjet engine modeling

There are two parts related to the thrust of AHV, air-
frame’s lower surface and engine hood, as shown in
Fig.5. The lower surface is divided into forebody,
middle part and afterbody. The scramjet engine is
composed of the middle part and the engine hood. The

details of each and corresponding functions are shown
in Table 4, and some of the results of thrust calculation
are shown in Fig.6.

Fig.6 Engine characteristics of AHV.

After analyzing the preceding calculation results,
the following conclusions are obtained.

(1) The thrust of AHV consists of two parts, one is
the uninstalled thrust from the scramjet engine, which
is yielded according to the momentum conservation
law between the vehicle and high speed exhaust eject-
ing from the nozzle; the other part is the vector sum of
the pressure generated by the high temperature exhaust
on the surface of vehicle afterbody, and this is calcu-
lated with Prandtl-Meyer formula. Generally speaking,
the thrust generated from the afterbody is larger than
the uninstalled thrust. And the afterbody contributes
about 60% to 80% of the total thrust.

(2) The states before and after the shock wave are
calculated by the oblique shock wave theory, and the
results are served as the interface conditions of scram-
jet engine. The forebody only generates aerodynamic
force which is predicted by the inviscous hypersonic
aerodynamic theory, as shown in Fig.2.

(3) The resultant data shows that exhaust flow state,
uninstalled thrust and specific fuel ratio are all influ-

- 86° LI Huifeng et al. / Chinese Journal of Aeronautics 24(2011) 81-89 No.1

enced by the states after the oblique shock wave and
the fuel equivalence ratio o;7. Uninstalled thrust is
proportional to 6; and increases as the Mach number
increases; but the increasing speed decreases with the
increase of Mach number. The specific fuel ratio also
linearly varies with respect to 67, and increases with
Mach number but decreases with altitude.

(4) As well as the thrust, lift force and pitch moment
are generated at the forebody, which are part of the
total aerodynamic force and momentum.

5. Modeling Results
5.1. AHV model

Data of aerodynamic characteristics and engine
performance can be obtained from the preceding cal-
culation. The data could be used by interpolation or
fitting. Interpolation is suitable for small amount of but
accurate sample data, such as the wind tunnel test data.
Fitting is always employed in the situation emphasiz-
ing the approximate trends while the accuracy re-
quirement is lower, such as the CFD calculation re-
sults. Hence, multivariate fitting is adopted and evalu-
ated by relative error (RE). RE is defined as

RE = 100% (1)
u

where u is original data vector, @ the vector yield from
fitting formula at the same state point, and |||| the

norm of vector.
All the resultant fitting formulas are listed as fol-

Fitting results show that

(1) The lift, drag and pitching moment are affected
by the propulsion system. Thus, they include aerody-
namics part and propulsion part. Correspondingly the
coefficients could be described as

Cr = Cra + Cre (14)
Cp =Cpa + Coe (15)

(2) The total thrust coefficient consists of unin-
stalled thrust coefficient and afterbody thrust coeffi-
cient, 1.e.

Cr = Cp + Cr (17)

(3) Because viscosity is not considered, altitude has
no effect on aerodynamic coefficient and affects pro-
pulsion coefficient by within 2%. Therefore, the influ-
ence of altitude can be ignored. However, altitude still
considerably influences fuel consumption (see Fig.6).

(4) As is consistent with the configuration, the atti-
tude of AHV is changed by the following manners:

1) Rolling motion—differential movement of the
two horizontal wings, that 1s 0.;= —dx.

2) Pitching motion—linkage movement of the two
horizontal wings, that 1s 6.;=0e2.

3) Yawing motion—BTT control method is adopted,
that is 6.;= —oOs and 6,0.

In order to establish 6 DOF rigid-body model of
AHV, equations of motion and geometric equations
still need to be selected. For hypersonic flights, equa-
tions of motion are established reasonably with ab-
sence of wind and _ curved’ Earth without

5.2. Trim flight simulation

Under the flight conditions of the given altitude,
Mach number, longitude, and roll angle, trim flight
simulation has been executed. The final trim result is
shown in Fig.7. In Fig.7, g is the dynamic pressure and
dQ the heating rate.

With the control variable limits and the angle of at-
tack limit being considered, the two triangle marked
boundaries are obtained. Since the scramjet is applied,
there are two velocity limits (Vin and Vinx) to suit the
property of scramjet. Besides, with dynamic pressure
limit (the black boundary) and heating rate limit (the
red boundary) being concerned, the whole flight cor-
ridor of AHV is acquired (see Fig.7). The state point
(V, 7) within the flight corridor indicates that

Oot min Ss Oot trim Ss Oct max (44)
Oo2 min Ss e2,trim Ss Oo max (45)
Or min < OF trim < Or max (46)
Qin Ss Crim Ss Qinax (47)
Vinin <Vs V max (48)

Vim <9 X 10° Pa (49)

dO nin < 7.910? W/m? (50)

where subscript “min” and “max” mean the corre-
sponding limits; subscript “trim” means that the vari-
able values are obtained from the trim calculation.

5.3. Model verification

The typical flight points of the similar vehicle are
utilized to verify AHV model, since the general pa-
rameters and flight conditions are mainly referred to
the vehicle (see Table 6).

Table 6 Typical flight points

Parameter Point 1 Point 2 Point 3
Vi(m-s ') 1 788.2 1 812.7 1 963.8
Alkm 24.4 24.4 30.5

Obviously, all the typical flight points are within the
flight corridor of AHV, indicating that the Eqs.(44)-
(50) are satisfied. Thus, the modeling of AHV is ac-
complished.

6. Conclusions

This article presents parameterized configuration
approach for hypersonic vehicle modeling. Through
parameterized aerodynamics/propulsion integration,
inviscous hypersonic aerodynamic calculation and
scramjet engine modeling, a 6 DOF rigid-body model
of AHV is obtained. Trim results prove the rationality
and effectiveness of AHV model.

Further work will be focused on model analysis,
such as evaluating the impact of typical configuration
parameters on the vehicle performance, analyzing ve-
hicle’s flight envelope and path constraints (angle of
attack limit for scramjet, heating rate and dynamic
pressure for body and wings, etc.).
