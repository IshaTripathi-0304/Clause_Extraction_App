Office of i No. 49 FY 19/20
The Governor DATE April 29, 2020

AN ORDER TO STAY SAFER AT HOME

WHEREAS, I proclaimed a state of emergency on March 15, 2020 and a renewed state of
emergency on April 14, 2020 to authorize the use of emergency powers in order to expand and
expedite the State’s response to the serious health and safety risks of the highly contagious COVID-
19; and

WHEREAS, between March 18" and April 3°? I issued Executive Orders 14, 19, 28 and 34 FY
19/20 that, for the reasons and upon the authorities stated therein, imposed until April 30 certain
emergency rules and limitations necessary to respond to COVID-19; and

WHEREAS, it is necessary to extend the effective dates of those Orders to continue to protect
public health while, at the same time, implementing the Together We Are Maine: Restarting
Maine’s Economy Plan (hereinafter Restarting Plan), as the deliberative process to identify how
certain restrictions on businesses and activities can be safely and incrementally eased over time;

NOW, THEREFORE, I, Janet T. Mills, Governor of the State of Maine, pursuant to 37-B M.R.S.
Ch. 13, including but not limited to the authorities cited in the Proclamations and Orders referenced
above, do hereby Order as follows:

L PURPOSE

The purposes of this Order are to continue to prioritize protection of public health and safety by
keeping certain existing public safety measures for business and personal activities in effect
through May 31, 2020 and to implement the Restarting Plan to assess how certain restrictions may,
consistent with expert public health guidance, be safely eased to permit more economic and
personal activity.

----$$$$----$$$$----
IH. CONTINUED PRIORITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH

Protection of public health and our health care delivery system shall remain the first priority. The
Commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Director of the
Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shall continue to advise on COVID-19
trends and metrics to guide the timing, pace and scope of any easing of current restrictions. Maine
CDC currently tracks, subject to change, three primary metrics:

A. a downward trajectory of reported influenza-like illnesses and COVID-like
syndromic cases;

B. a downward trajectory of documented cases and newly hospitalized patients; and

C, the capacity of Maine’s hospital systems to treat all patients without crisis care and
the ability of the State to engage in a robust testing program.

HI. EXISTING EXECUTIVE ORDERS EXTENDED

To continue to protect public health, the effective dates of Executive Orders 14, 19, 28 and 34 FY
19/20 are hereby extended through May 31, 2020 unless sooner amended. All other provisions of
such Orders remain in effect and subject to interpretive guidance. Such guidance includes, but is
not limited to, the implementation of the Restarting Plan, incorporated into this Order by this
reference.

IV. STAGES OF THE RESTARTING PLAN

Starting May 1, 2020, and consistent with Maine CDC/DHHS tracking metrics and
recommendations, the Commissioner of the Department of Economic and Community
Development (DECD) shall implement the Restarting Plan and identify businesses and activities
where current restrictions may be adjusted to safely allow for more economic and personal activity.
Businesses and activities so identified may receive a conditional approval consistent with the
Restarting Plan. Any such approval is subject to change depending upon the demonstrated efficacy
of the conditions imposed or the changing or general needs of public health. Any such approval is
also subject to suspension or revocation depending upon actual and consistent compliance with
such conditions. DHHS shall issue guidance for DECD and others on the process for health
services identified in the Restarting Plan.

V. CLOTH FACE COVERINGS

Consistent with guidance from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
individuals must wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other physical distancing
measures are difficult to maintain.

A. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following
meanings.

----$$$$----$$$$----
l. “Public settings” mean:

a. indoor spaces that are accessible to the public such as grocery stores,
retail stores, pharmacies and health care facilities;

b. outdoor spaces such as playgrounds, busy parking lots, and other
areas such as lines for take-out service where the public typically
gathers in a smaller area; and

C. public transportation such as a taxi, Uber, Lyft, ride-sharing or
similar service; ferry, bus, or train; and any semi-enclosed transit
stop or waiting area.

Employers in settings that are not typically accessible to the public may
determine the persons who should wear a cloth face covering at their
workplace and shall permit any employee who wants to wear a covering to
do so.

2. “Individual” means any person in such settings irrespective of whether the
person is an employee, customer, vendor, invitee or other.

3. “Cloth Face Covering” is a protection that covers the nose and mouth; fits
snugly but comfortably against the side of the face; is secured with ties or
ear loops; has multiple layers of fabric; allows for breathing without
restriction; and is able to be laundered and machine dried without damage
or change to its shape.

Exceptions. Cloth face coverings are not required for children under age 2, a child
in a child care setting, or for anyone who has trouble breathing or related medical
conditions, or who is otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. A
person who cannot wear a cloth face covering because of a medical condition is not
required to produce medical documentation of the condition, provided that an
employer may require such documentation from an employee in accordance with
state and federal law.

Other. Cloth face coverings are not a replacement for adhering to social distancing
protocols. As recommended by current CDC guidance, surgical masks and N-95
respirators are critical supplies that will remain be reserved for health care workers,
medical first responders, and other workers as recommended by Federal guidance.

----$$$$----$$$$----
VI. EFFECTIVE DATE

This Order takes effect on April 29, 2020, with section V taking effect on May 1, 2020.
