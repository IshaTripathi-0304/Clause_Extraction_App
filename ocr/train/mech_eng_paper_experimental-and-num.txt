Abstract

The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of externally applied magnetic fields on the weld quality in laser beam
welding. The optimization of the process parameters was performed using the results of computer simulations. Welding tests
were performed with up to 20 kW laser beam power. It was shown that the AC magnet with 3 kW power supply allows for a
prevention of the gravity drop-out for full penetration welding of 20 mm thick stainless steel plates. For partial penetration
welding it was shown that an 0.5 T DC magnetic field is enough for a suppression of convective flows in the weld pool. Partial
penetration welding tests with 4 kW beam power showed that the application of AC magnetic fields can reduce weld porosity by
a factor of 10 compared to the reference joints. The weld surface roughness was improved by 50 %.

laser beam forms a narrow weld pool with nearly parallel side walls. During solidification of the weld pool, the
longitudinal and transversal shrinkage stress variations along the keyhole axis are much lower than in most other
welding technologies. This results in very low buckling and bending of the workpiece (Ready et al. (2001)).
Moreover, full penetration welding can suppress the development of the so-called process porosity due to the
keyhole instability near its bottom tip, see Seto et al. (2001). However, for full penetration welding of thick metal
parts the surface tension cannot completely compensate the hydrostatic pressure in the melt. This can result in
sagging of the root side of the weld or even a complete drop-out of the melt when the workpiece thickness is above a
threshold.

Both AC and DC magnetic fields can be effectively used to control large amounts of molten metal in many
industrial processes, e.g. crystal growth and metal casting. The so-called electromagnetic (EM) processing is widely
used and well-known to stabilize the surface of solidifying material, to accelerate (EM stirring) or decelerate (the
Hartmann effect) the convection in metal flows to refine the melt from oxide particles and gas bubbles (EM
rectification), see e. g. the proceedings of the last EPM (Electromagnetic Processing of Materials) conference 2012.

The idea to use this technology to prevent the gravity drop-out in high power laser beam welding of thick
stainless steel plates was developed in Jones et al. (2003) and successfully verified in full penetration welding tests
of up to 12 mm thick stainless steel (Avilov et al. (2009)) and 30 mm thick Al-alloy plates (Avilov et al. (2012)).

The numerical investigations in this paper were made with the commercial finite element solver COMSOL
Multiphysics 4.2 to get insights into the process zone and a detailed description of the underlying effects as well as
to analyze the MHD interactions with the fluid flow and subsequent solidification behavior in the weld pool.
Moreover, a simulation allows for an optimization of the process parameters including the amplitude and the
frequency of the magnetic field.

2. Physical Background
The interaction between the fluid flow during welding and the applied magnetic fields is due to the Lorentz force
F, ={xB, (1)
where j and B are the electric current density and the magnetic flux density. When the applied magnetic field is

of oscillatory nature, electric eddy currents develop in the workpiece inside the skin depth which depends on the
applied oscillation frequency according to the classical skin effect theory, see Landau et al. (1984):

0= (muaf , (2)

with the magnetic permeability in vacuum My, the electric conductivity o and the frequency f . The time-
average of the resulting electromagnetic force is directed against the gravity force. Thus, a drop-out of metal can be
suppressed. A further component to the electric current density is due to the movement of the electrically conducting
material transverse to the magnetic field:

J, =uxB. (3)
The part of the Lorentz force due to this effect is directed against the melt velocity acting as a braking force. That

force is also present for the application of time-invariant magnetic fields and is called Hartmann effect. The strength
of the electromagnetic deceleration can be expressed in terms of the Hartmann number:

Ha? =o(BIL) /n, (4)

with the half weld bead width L and the dynamic viscosity 7. Schematic illustrations of both effects can be seen
in Figure 1.

where B is the rms-value of the applied magnetic field on the weld pool surface.

An oscillating magnetic field can effectively remove gas bubbles and other non-conducting inclusions from the
melt (EM rectification, see e.g. Takahashi et al. (2003)). All non-conductive inclusions (e. g. bubbles or oxide
particles) in the melt disturb the ideal profile of the electric current density. As a result, the inclusion is forced to
move in the opposite direction of the electromagnetic force F,. Based on the Lenov—Kolin theory
(Lenov et al. (1954)) the total EM Archimedes force F', (per unit volume) acting on a small inclusion (smaller than
5) can be written as follows. The Lenov-Kolin factor G,, for spherical bubbles is 0.75.

Another EM technology is the stabilization of the weld pool
surface (Garnier-Moreau effect). This effect can be explained
in terms of the so-called EM contribution to the surface
tension. .

3. Numerical simulation of a weld pool support by oscillating magnetic fields

The availability of high power laser systems enables the full-penetration welding of very thick components, e.g.
for pressure vessels or power station components. The hydrostatic pressure in the melt can exceed the pressure due
to surface tension and results in sagging or even a complete drop-out of the melt, see Figure 3. Experimental results
from Avilov et al. (2009) show the possibility of a contactless weld pool support system by oscillating magnetic
fields that works in all welding positions. A moderate magnetic flux density of around 141 mT was necessary to
compensate a 12 mm melt column of AISI 304 at an oscillation frequency of 3.18 kHz.

3.1. Aluminum

The simulation results for the full-penetration welding of 20 mm thick aluminum with a welding speed of
0.5 m/min without applied magnetic fields (reference case) as well as with three different magnetic flux densities are
shown in Figure 5. The hydrostatic pressure in the reference case is linearly increasing with the depth in the weld
pool. Applying a magnetic field tends to lower the pressure differences between the surfaces up to a balance state
with nearly no gravity driven drop-out or sagging of melt which was detected at around 70 mT and an oscillation
frequency of 450 Hz. According to the Lorentz force distribution, the flow dynamics in the weld pool is only
affected in the lower part within the skin depth of the applied magnetic field, see Figure 6. Large-scaled Marangoni
vortex formations occur near the surfaces due to the temperature variation of the surface tension. In the lower part of
the weld pool, the electromagnetic forces induce a second vortex acting against the Marangoni vortex which
indicates a Lorentz force gradient there which is due to the relation of the magnet pole and the length of the molten
zone (see Bachmann et al. (2012)). Hence, the weld pool shortens by the applied forces. The magnitudes of the flow

velocities in the upper weld pool remain nearly unaffected. Experimentally obtained weld pool macrographs of
AlMg3 (Figure 5) show the same trends found in the simulations, namely sagging was avoided and the weld
geometry was Y-shaped. A detailed description can be found in Bachmann et al. (2012).

3.2. Stainless steel AISI 304

The same approach as for aluminum was also pursued for 20 mm thick stainless steel AISI 304. In the
simulations, the material was assumed to behave ideally non-ferromagnetic. Three different oscillation frequencies
were investigated corresponding to skin depths of a quart, a half and the full weld depth. The welding speed was set
to 0.4 m/min. Figure 7 shows the pressure and Lorentz force distributions for the reference case and the magnetic
support cases. Increasing the frequency produces a steeper Lorentz force and accordingly a steeper pressure gradient
in the lower part of the weld pool due to the skin effect. Nevertheless, an optimal control of the hydrostatic pressure

in the melt was proven for all frequencies. Increasing the frequency leads to lower magnetic flux densities for the
compensation of the 20 mm stainless steel, see Bachmann et al. (2014), which is due to a frequency-dependent
relation between the applied magnetic flux density and the resulting Lorentz force.

In comparison to aluminum, stainless steel has a significantly lower thermal conductivity. Therefore, the weld
pool length for a similar welding speed is smaller, see Figure 8. The main characteristics of the fluid flow inside the
molten pool also just remain the same. Due to the smaller weld pool dimensions at a constant magnet pole geometry,
the Lorentz force gradient in the liquid region is smaller compared to aluminum. Therefore, the flow characteristics
in the lower part of the weld pool is still similar to that in the upper region outside the penetration depth of the
magnetic field when welding with electromagnetic support system. Experimental results for different thicknesses
can be seen in Figure 7.

4. Numerical simulation of a weld pool deceleration by steady magnetic fields

Another MHD effect to control unfavorable dynamics in the weld pool especially when welding very thick
components associated to severe spattering is called the Hartmann effect. Experimental work in this field in welding
was done by Kern et al. (2000) with a CO, laser. He observed a distinct smoothing of the weld pool surface and the
humping phenomenon was suppressed depending on the polarity of the applied magnetic field. However, the
Hartmann number was only around 100. A disk laser was used in the present investigation for the partial penetration
welding of aluminum with a keyhole penetration of around 21 mm. Permanent magnets were mounted on both sides
of the workpiece to maximize the magnetic flux density in the weld pool, see Figure 9. The numerical model used
the standard two equation k-e turbulence model.

Velocity streamlines for the reference case as well as the case with an applied magnetic field of 0.5 T are shown
in Figure 10. In the reference case, the flow characteristics is mainly due to the Marangoni stresses which cause the

liquid metal to flow from hot regions around the keyhole to the boundary regions. When a magnetic field is applied,
the flow velocities in the weld pool are significantly smaller due to the braking nature of the Hartmann effect, see
Figure 11. In the depth of the weld pool, the reversal of the flow due to the Marangoni effect is limited to an ever
thinner boundary region with increasing magnetic flux density. It was found that a Hartmann number of around 10°
was necessary for a dissipative influence of the applied magnetic forces (Bachmann et al (2013). Furthermore, the
suppression of the flow dynamics leads to a regular V-shape of the weld bead in the simulations and in the
experiments as well (Figure 12).

5. Partial penetration laser welding with EM control of the weld pool

In the next two subsections, the results of partial penetration laser beam welding tests of Al alloy components
are shown. The first problem of partial penetration laser beam welding is the keyhole-tip instability representing the
main source of porosity — gas bubbles leave the keyhole near its tip, see Seto et al. (2001). The second problem is
very intensive thermocapillary (Marangoni) convection in the upper part of the weld pool. The surface tension
cannot completely suppress oscillations of the weld pool surface and the re-solidified welds show very rough
surfaces with large undercuts. Here, AC magnetic fields were used to suppress porosity formation and to
stabilize the weld pool surface in bead-on-plate partial penetration laser beam welding of 10 mm thick AIMg3
plates in flat position.

5.1 Experimental set-up

521

All welding experiments were performed using
4kW laser beam power. The AC magnet was
mounted direct on the welding head of the laser
welding optics. The externally applied AC
magnetic field was oriented perpendicularly to the
welding direction. To prevent optical feed-back
the incident angle a of the laser beam was taken
to be 18° to the vertical, see Figure 13. The
magnet core was made of 0.05 mm thick Fe-Si
lamination (microsil). The cross-section of both
magnet poles (Fluxtrol A) was 20 mm x 20 mm.
The gap between the magnet poles was 20 mm
and the distance between the AC magnet and the
sample was 2 mm. The shielding gas (argon with
a flow rate of 20 l/min) was supplied to the front
side of the weld pool.

The main parameters of the laser beam source
(TRUMPF Yb:YAG thin disk laser TruDisk
16002, max. beam power 16 kW) are listed in

5.2 Results and discussion

Figure 14 illustrates the welding tests without and with oscillating magnetic field applied. The reference
welds with the focal position set on the surface (z = 0) show a very intensive formation of process porosity.
However, this type of pores is quasi-spherical and they are located in the center of the weld pool. Hence, it is
expected, that the magnetic field can successfully prevent this type of pores. The amplitude of the magnetic
field must be large enough and the skin depth in the order of the penetration depth (around 6 mm).

Figure 14(b)-(d) show x-ray side views of the welds with EM weld pool control as well as metallographic
cross sections. Analyses of the cross-sections and the x-ray images show a drastic reduction (more than 90 %)
of the weld porosity for an optimal oscillation frequency. The observed effects can be explained in terms of
EM Archimedes forces as well as the EM stirring in the weld pool.

Further improvements by the application of the magnetic fields were also observed in terms of the surface
quality, see the cross sections in Figure 14 and the measured surface profiles in Figure 15. The usage of AC
magnetic fields results in a significant reduction of up to 50 % of the weld surface roughness. Figure 16 shows
the surface quality in terms of welding-induced undercuts according to DIN EN ISO 13919-2:2001. Here, a
clear reduction is remarkable and the quality level could be improved from group D in the reference case to
group B with all oscillation frequencies of the magnetic fields applied.

6. EM weld pool control for laser beam welding with filler wire

A series of welding tests was performed magnet poles
to demonstrate that the EM weld pool
control can also be used for industrial laser
beam welding applications with filler wire
such as the welding of butt joints of
complex non-planar parts. Figure 17 shows
the experimental setup, which simulates the

The diameter of the beam delivery fiber was 0.2 mm. The beam diameter at the focal plane corresponds to 560 um
and the focal length was 350 mm. The focal position was z = -3 mm (under the surface). The shielding gas nozzle
(industrial grade argon with a flow rate of 20 l/min) was placed behind the laser beam. The welding velocity and the
wire feed rate for all welding tests were taken to be 1.7 m/min and 2.2 m/min, respectively. The gap between the
magnet poles was 22.5 mm and the gap between the magnet and the workpiece was 2 mm. Both the focal position of
the laser beam and the contact point of the filler wire correspond to the middle of the area located between the
magnet poles. For full penetration welding the AC magnet can be placed near the root of the specimen and the filler
wire nozzle can be mounted on the welding head on the front side. If the skin-depth is lower than the workpiece
width, the AC magnet field does not influence the filler wire. However, for the container closing process there is no
access to the interior space of the workpiece. Thus, only partial penetration laser welding process is possible. Both
the AC magnet and the filler wire nozzle must be located on the outer side of the container wall. The filler wire
nozzle was made of electrically non-conductive material (Teflon) and the filler wire system was electrically
disconnected from the workpiece to prevent the excitation of eddy currents.

analysis of the weld cross-sections. The welds with EM control are wider than their references and their penetration
depth becomes smaller. This can be explained by an intensive stirring in the melt due to an inhomogeneous Lorentz
force distribution in the weld pool caused by the asymmetric workpiece setup. This effect, in addition to the pore
removal, is especially useful for the dilution in the weld material when welding structures with very deep weld
beads with filler material. The inhomogeneous Lorentz force distribution is also noticeable by the asymmetric weld
macro sections when welding with EM control in Figure 18.

7. Summary & Conclusions

The present investigations reveal that oscillating and steady magnetic fields can have a significant positive effect
on the quality as well as the stability of high-power laser beam welding processes of aluminum alloys and stainless
steel. The results in this paper point to various EM applications in welding, e.g. the EM weld pool support, the EM
braking of the flow velocities, the EM rectification, and EM weld surface improvements that can be used for a
variety of industrial applications.

The most decisive quantities for a successful application of EM technologies in welding are the magnetic flux
density and, in the case of oscillating magnetic fields, the frequency and the according skin depth. Additionally, the
orientation of the applied magnetic fields relative to the workpiece is relevant for the performance of the MHD
effects in the weld bead.

Clear improvements in terms of avoiding melt sagging, reducing spattering, decreasing surface roughness, and
the reduction of pore content could be demonstrated. Thus, the EM technology could be numerically and
experimentally proven to be an appropriate tool for a successful implementation in various welding applications.
