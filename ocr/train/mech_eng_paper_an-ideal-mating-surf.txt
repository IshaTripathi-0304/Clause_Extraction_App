Abstract

A method to substitute the actual mating surfaces into an ideal mating surfaces is proposed in this paper. A unit normal vector is
used to express their position and orientation. To simulate the variation propagation in assemble process, an error accumulate model
was built in the foundational coordinate system and can be solved by the homogeneous transformation matrix (HTM). Thus the
accuracy prediction of mechanical system could be realized in the condition of rigid body. The ideal matting surfaces under loading
could be calculated by finite element method. The parameters of the normal vectors would be varied due to the part deformation.
By discretization of vector elements in tolerance zone, the actual element variation under loading can be calculated and the
distribution and probability density function compared to the rigid body can be obtained. A grind dress was taken as an example to
illustrate this method.

1. Introduction

In machine tools and other high precision mechanical
systems, the precision of parts significantly impacts on
product performance. An effective model is needed to
analyze system accuracy and determine the parts’
accuracy considering a variety of requirements. However
the traditional accuracy predicting methods have a
tedious and error-prone calculation. More importantly, it
separates the combined effect and interaction of
dimensional tolerances and geometric tolerance in
precision forming process. In recent years, many scholars
had great achievement on the tolerance analysis of
complex mechanical system. Alain[1] and Philippe[2]
applied Jacobian matrix to establish the statistically
tolerance analysis model. ZHOU[3] used _ several
simulation generates pseudo-random number to improve

ring structure, proposed one statistical tolerance design
method. Anselmetti[5] discussed a variety of surface
tolerance chain. Zhang[6] used polychromatic sets to
describe the feature-based hierarchical tolerance
information, reasoned constraint meta-level of the
underlying framework. Shen[7] comparative studied the
currently four analytical methods.

This paper proposed the part model with dimensional
tolerances and geometric tolerances information, from
the changes range of ideal face. This paper extracted the
unit normal vector of ideal surface, obtained the spatial
location and distribution of the mechanical systems’
ideal assembly plane by the homogeneous
transformation matrix, then achieved the accuracy
prediction of the whole mechanical system.

2. Methodology
2.1. Model of the ideal surfaces

The ideal surfaces are the ideal planes of parts with
assumed full contacting; they could produce the same
effect of error propagation and accumulation as the
actual surface. Ideal surface could use the geometric
centre unit normal vector of the parts to represent the
spatial position and _ orientation, includes angles
(a, B,yv) and coordinates (x, y,z). For a single part, the
Cartesian coordinate system could be established in one
geometric centre of the ideal surface of parts. In this
coordinate system, the unit normal vectors of the parts
could be used to present the actual mating surfaces. Then
the mathematical model of single part could be gotten
for the accuracy prediction, including all geometry
information.

Fig. 1. The ideal surface of parts

In Figure 1, P’ , B are the ideal surface
corresponding, FP, is the ideal location of P, , the
coordinate system origin located at the geometric center,
V,, V, are the unit normal vectors of P’, P, . The
unit normal vector of ideal surface representation is:

D =[R3T] =[a,B,yix,y.2z)

R is the rotation sub-matrix, including a , 6 and y
parameter, T is the displacement sub-matrices, including
x, y and z parameters.

The variation range of unit normal vector parameters
could express three-dimensional space change range
constrained by tolerances. Firstly, the parameters of the
unit normal vector could be gotten from surface design
information conversion methods, and then the range of
unit normal vector’s variation could be obtained
according to the tolerance principle of requirements.

2.2. Variation propagation of assembly processes

The geometry error of feature during assembly will be
converted to the unit normal vectors in the part
coordinate systems, by using the homogeneous
transformation matrix to embed the unit normal vectors
in the assembly path. The error accumulation model in
the assembly process could be gotten.

In a single coordinate system, define the unit normal
vector from the origin to point of position vector,
convert it to a reference coordinate system:

2.3. Variation of ideal surface under loading

When the working condition is considered, the
position and orientation changes of the vectors of the
ideal surface due to part deformation should be
calculated.

Firstly, the discrete elements of unit normal vector in
variation zone could be picked out to simulate the
geometry trend. The geometry model could be built
according to these discrete elements. The actual feature
changing under loading can be obtained account into
FEM-based approaches. The mapping function between
corresponding elements before and after loading is
established by the independent variables of elements
after loading. Then the probability density function after
loading can be obtained by substitution of the mapping
function into former probability density function, and
this probability density function also expresses the error
distribution after loading. This process is shown in Fig.

Taking grinding dresser’s feeding system as an
example, the process of accuracy prediction will be
illustrated by the ideal surface method. Shown in Figure

part 6 reflects the final assembles precision in the base
coordinate system.

The actual assembly process is: firstly part 2 and 3
join part 1, secondly parts 4 and part 5 join 6. Finally the
whole assembly could be gotten. The coordinate system
of part 1 is the mechanical system’s reference, the ideal
surfaces of part 2 and part 3 will be converted to the base
coordinate system, then the ideal surface 2 * is overall
fitted from parts 1,2 and 3. The ideal surface 4 * could
be gotten by the same method. Finally it is converted to
the basic coordinate system of part 1.

3000 random error samples were selected from the
variation range of unit normal vector in normal
distribution to simulate numerical analysis the assembly
precision. The contours of P position in the reference
coordinate system could be gotten.

The space coordinates of point P could be gotten
after 3,000 times accuracy analysis simulation. The
average value of position error is 57.1, and the variance
is 46.8.

3.2. Under working condition

According to the method mentioned in 2.3, based on
the simulation on nominal size of FEA model under
loading, the corresponding tolerance zone and
distribution variation could be analysed in the following
processes.

As showed in Fig. 11, taking the a element of unit
normal vector in the A surface of base part as an
example.

Fig. 11. The variation of angle element a of A surface

A rigid surface was modeled and moved close to the
contact surface to generate a displacement constraint.
The mapping curve between displacement and reaction
force can be obtained by FEA approach. Conversely,
according to the actual loading on the fitting surface
corresponded to the displacement of the rigid surface,
the variation of the corresponding element can also be
calculated, and the multi-loading condition can be
simulated in the same way.

As shown in Fig. 12, the variation zone of angle
element a of A surface is dispersed into some points.
The relationship between the displacement of the rigid
surface and the reaction force of the fitting surface is
illustrated.

Based on the variation zone and distribution of unit
normal vector of the ideal surface calculated in this
method, the tolerance analysis of the assembly under
loading would be more easily.

The grinding dresser is taken as the example.
Considering the normal work condition, the error
samples are obtained according to the tolerance
specification, and revised through FEM approach. The
assembly accuracy is predicted by the variation
propagation model. In this example, 3000 samples were
picked to simulate the normal distribution of the
geometry tolerance of each feature.

Comparing the two figures in Fig. 15, the distribution
and probability density function of the working point
under loading is different to the former simulation
without considering part deformation.

4. Conclusions

(1) This paper proposed a part precisions model

covered dimensional tolerances and geometric tolerances
information.

(2) The method of unit normal vector’s variation is
proposed in the rigid condition. The variation range and

311

distribution of unit normal vector by the load is discussed.

(3) The accumulation error model is established based
on ideal mating surface method. It realizes the accuracy
prediction of the mechanical system. The accuracy
prediction could be calculated by selecting the samples.
The samples could be gotten by the variation range and
distribution of unit normal vector.

(4) The distribution would be different as the part
deformation under loading was considered. As the error
variation is much less than the nominal dimension, it is
not a significant difference.
