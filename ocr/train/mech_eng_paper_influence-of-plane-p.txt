Abstract

The purpose of the present paper is to determine a mathematical model in order to evaluate theoretically the roughness of a
spherical surface finished with a torodial end mill. The parameters that influence the theoretical value of the roughness are: (1)
technological parameters (cutting speed, feed per tooth, radial feed) or (11) geometrical (the geometry of the semi-product, the
geometry of the cutting tool). The calculus to determine the roughness value is a difficult task taking into consideration the
complexity of the mathematical relations; the paper presents a graphic method using a CAD application (AutoCAD) and a
programming environment (AutoLISP).

1. The Premises of the Mathematical Model

The optical block of a motor vehicle is commonly-known as the headlight; it serves to light up the road in
conditions of low visibility and it comes under road lighting regulations. The main components of the optical block
are (Figure 1): (1) cover; (i1) reflector; (111) the transparent optical part.

In addition to these, there is also the light source, the vertical control system of the light spot, the wire harness
and the necessary contacts, fasteners. The three main components are manufactured by plastic injection.The
aesthetical and functional requirements for the headlights affect the complexity of the injection molds proper to
these components. The emergence of CNC processing machines and of the computer aided design and
manufacturing applications revolutionized the engineering of plastic injection molds, this NC-CAD-CAM trio
giving free hand to the auto designers. The quality of lighting is decided by the quality level of the mold cores
surfaces, though despite the technological progress, the manual polishing perfection is still to be achieved. The
present paper deals with aspects regarding the quality of the mold cores and offers technological recommendations,
taking into account cost and productivity issues.

The active interior surface of the reflector and implicitly the forming surface of the injection mold’s core is a
sculptural surface that cannot be expressed by mathematical relations. In order to define equations for determining
the theoretical roughness of a mill-generated surface, it is required an approximation of this forming surface with a
pitch surface (plane, cylinder, cone, sphere, torus), respectively with a spherical surface (Figure 2). The spherical
section defines the portion between two parallel planes intercepting a sphere.

The mathematical approach accounts using a 3 axis processing centre, setting vertically the milling tool axis. The
accounted finishing paths are plane-parallel and radial. The following index presents the inputs in the mathematical
evaluation of the theoretical micro asperities’ heights:

2. The Mathematical Model

Consider a reference system XjYoZo attached to the core of the mold and a reference system X, YZ, attached to
the torodial end mill. The torodial end mill is revolving around its axis with a rotative speed n and shifts on
trajectories in the form of circular contour lines, sweeping the entire forming surface (Figure 3). The torodial end
mill can move on a contour line by cut-up milling or cut-down milling.

NN ZI TOOLPATH TRAJECTORIES

Fig. 3. Case of plane-parallel paths

Both Z axes —of the cutting tool and of the workpiece — are positioned in such way to have the same direction as
the Z axis of the CNC machine and its positive sense. As the workpiece is of revolution, the direction and the sense
of the X and Y axes are taken randomly.

The bit edge that generates the torus of the cutting tool’s active area, is defined by the parameters R1 and R2 and
v (Figure 3). The equation of the bit edge, of the circular curve described by point P in figure 3 can be written in a
parametric form, using the following expression:

X,= 0

Y, = R, + R2sinv (1)
Z, = R2sinv

where v passes through the range v € t ; “|.

Fig. 4. Positioning the horizontal plane

The directory path on which the cutting tool is moving is a circular trajectory obtained by intersecting the
spherical area with the horizontal plane —positioned by the parameter 0 (Figure 4). Considering the tangency of the
bit edge to the spherical area between the position angle v of the point P and the angle 0 that defines the position of
the horizontal plane, we define the relation:

Q=7-v (2)

As such, the vector that defines the position of point P is written as:

0
R, + R, cos 6
R, cos @

According to figure 5, the cutting tool executes a roto-translation movement along the circular directory path
(starting from the initial moment t0) and a point P on the bit edge will describe a curled epicycloid.

The theoretical roughness of this mill-generated surface is the distance between the directory path and the
interior intersection point of the curled epicycloid. More bit edges generate more curled epicycloids that intersect
themselves, influencing directly the roughness value, meaning that more teeth the mill cutter has, higher the quality
of the surface will be.

Next, a proposition for a mathematical model to determine the equations for these curled epicycloid curves and to
determine the theoretical roughness of the mill-generated surface, depending on the technological parameters, on the
cutting tool’s parameters and on the geometry of the finished product. As a mathematical instrument, it was used the
coordinate transformation method.

Fig. 6. Defining the secondary system

In order to write easier the curves’ equations, it was used a secondary reference system, which executes a
translation motion along the equidistant circle to the directory path, and a rotary motion chose in such a manner that
the Y axis is oriented towards the origin of the base system attached to the workpiece (Figure 6). Angle y forms
between the two reference systems, the secondary system and the one attached to the milling tool. The angle can
have a positive value corresponding to cut-up milling or a negative value corresponding to cut-down milling.

As such, the position vector of point P on the bit edge — in connection to the reference system XOYOZO attached
to the workpiece — is described with the following relation:

To = Mor * Ma ° 14 (4)

The transition matrix from the secondary system to the base reference system takes the following form:

My» = sinu. cosu OO —(R,+(R,+R,) cos @)cosu (6)

The following expressions are obtained after the calculus:
Xo = —X, cos sinu — x, sinWcosu+t (R, + (R, + R,) cos @)sinu
Vo = X, cos Wcosu—x,sinwsinu — (R, + (R, + R,) cos @)cosu (7)

Zo = (R2 + R,) sin @

Using trigonometric relations, we obtain the expression for the curled epicycloids curve:

----$$$$----$$$$----
416 Paul Chetan et al. / Procedia Technology 12 (2014) 411 — 419

Xo = —X,sin(u+ ww) + (R, + (R, + R,) cos @) sinu
Vo = X, cos(u +) — (R, + (R, + R,) cos 8) cosu (8)
Zp = (R2 + R;) sind

The final expression must contain the parameters defined at the beginning, such as cutting speed (V.), feed per
tooth, the cutting tool’s number of teeth, the diameter of the milling tool, corner radius and workpiece radius. 0 is
the position parameter for the horizontal plane and time ¢ is the incremental parameter. The rotative speed depends
on the cutting speed and on the effective diameter (defined by the position of point P in Figure 4), according to the
relation:

n= otc _ [rot/min] (9)

7 2*(Ry+R2 Sinv)*1

By defining the angular speed we obtain:

1000*V,

w = 2nn = —————
(R1+R2 sinv)

[rad/min] (10)

Or

@ = eee _ [rot/sec] (11)

~~ 60*(R1+Rp sinv)

The tool’s feed along the directory curve becomes:

1000*V,
2*60* (R1+R2 sinv)*

Vp =f, *Z* [mm/sec] (12)

The angle positioning the bit edge is described by the following relation:
180
p=wxt= wx——*t [deg] (13)

Introducing into the relation we obtain:

3000*V ot

y=+—_—_—__ [deg] (14)

~~ 70*(Ry+R2 sinv)
The covered distance is expressed as:
s=t*Vp=ux*(R, +(R,+R,)cos@) [mm] (15)

Expressing the angle u in degrees we obtain:

_ 3000*V.*f7*Zz4t
u= 2*m**(Ry+Rz2 sin v)*(R1+(R2+Rs) cos 8) [deg] (1 6)
Introducing into the relation:
g@="-y (17)

We obtain the expressions for the parameters u and W:

y= 4 30008Vext [deg] (19)

~~ 710*(R1+R2 cos 8)

Introducing these parameters in relation no. 8 we obtain the requested parametric equations — the curled
epicycloids described by the bit edge during the processing of the spherical area.

3. Evaluation of the mathematical results

The determination of the intersection points for the curled epicycloids curves according to the relations above is
an extremely difficult problem, with complicate relations. A more approachable solution is to use graphic methods.
This kind of curves can be easily generated with the help of a CAD environment and of a programming language.
This vectorial construction can load up any necessary information, including the required roughness.

Next, a calculus application for plotting the curled epicycloids curves, generated by finishing a spherical area
with plane-parallel trajectories. As CAD environment we used AutoCAD and as a programming language
AutoLISP.

Considering the next inputs:

Cutting speed Vc = 180 [m/min]
Feed per tooth fz = 0.05 [mm/rot]
Teeth number Z = 2

Diameter of the milling tool D=6 [mm]
Corner radius of the tool R2=2 [mm]
Radius of workpiece Rs = 50 [mm]

The LISP’s routine plots two curled epicycloid curves (Figure 7) displayed red and green, proper to the curves
described by the two bit edges of the tool. These curves are generated in the plane positioned by the 8 parameter on
a circle (displayed blue).

4. Conclusions

The numerical and theoretical study presented above reached the following conclusions:

e The active interior surface of a reflector is a sculptural surface that cannot be expressed by mathematical
relations;

e Creating a mathematical model to determine the theoretical roughness obtained by milling sculptural surfaces
requires an approximation for this surface, using a pitch surface through a spherical section;

e The calculus to determine the value of roughness represents a difficult problem due to the complexity of the
mathematical relations. The recommendation 1s for the use of graphic methods, a CAD environment along
with a programming language (in this case AutoCAD and AutoLISP);

e The curves described by the intersection point between the bit edge and the workpiece’s spherical area are
curled epicycloids;

e Plane-parallel finishing trajectories generate a surface with a theoretical variable roughness, better as the
surface is tilted.
