Abstract: In this paper, an impedance control algorithm based on velocity for capturing two
low impact docking mechanisms (LIDMs) is presented. The main idea of this algorithm is
to track desired forces when the position errors of two LIDMs are random by designing the
relationship between the velocity and contact forces measured by a load sensing ring to
achieve low impact docking. In this paper, the governing equation of an impedance
controller between the deviation of forces and velocity is derived, and simulations are
designed to verify how impedance parameters affect the control characteristics. The
performance of the presented control algorithm is validated by using the MATLAB and
ADAMS software for capturing simulations. The results of capturing simulations
demonstrate that the impedance control algorithm can respond fast and has excellent
robustness when the environmental errors are random, and the contact forces and torques

satisfy the low impact requirements.

1. Introduction

In order to dock two vehicles using a conventional mechanical docking assembly, the vehicles must
be pressed together with sufficient forces to re-align the misalignment of the soft capture ring [1]. The
action of forcing two vehicles together, particularly in space, might result in damages to one or both of
the vehicles or sensitive systems [2]. Thus, a type of docking mechanism which provides low impact
mating (i.e., a low impact docking mechanism, abbreviated as LIDM) has been developed by NASA [3],
ESA [4] and Chinese research institutions [5], respectively, in order to solve the problems noted above.
In particularly, the LIDM has a reconfigurable control system [1], which permits a load sensing ring
with an electromagnetic capture mechanism to perform a “soft” capture and mate two vehicles together.
As a result, a specified desired force, the ideal contact force between two docking mechanisms, could
be tracked during the capture process. Force tracking is the key to the success of capturing, which can
be solved by compliance control. Impedance force tracking control is very practical in the field of robotic
compliance control and the main concept is based on the impedance equation, which is the relationship
between force and position/velocity error [6].

The impedance control technique proposed by Hogan [7] is one of the fundamental approaches for
force tracking control of robot manipulators with constrained motion. Then, the performance of impedance
control was improved and the application was expanded to other fields by many researchers [8—10].
Differing from the hybrid position and force control approach [11], impedance control regulates the
force between a manipulator and the environment by defining the target impedance between position
and contact force. The desired force is indirectly controlled by prespecifying a robot-desired
displacement, which is determined by the stiffness and location of the environment [12]. One of the
major practical difficulties with impedance control is that the environmental stiffness cannot be known
precisely. Therefore accurate desired displacement cannot be designed to achieve accurate force control.
In the past, many attempts have been made to solve this problem. Lasky and Hsia [13] employed a
separate desired displacement modification control loop by using integral control. Lee [14] formulated
the generalized impedance relationship between a motion error and a contact force error, and Seraji [15]
generated a reference position using adaptive control. A neural network or fuzzy approach of force
control was introduced to solve a number of uncertainty problems [16]. Besides, the accurate
environment positions cannot be available in advance in impedance control, another difficulty for its
implementation, and poorly estimated environmental information may cause poor force tracking
results [17]. Especially for application of force control with random errors by applying a desired force,
the exact estimation of environment position is difficult. Therefore, it 1s difficult to design an expected
docking trajectory of two LIDMs, as the relative position errors of two vehicles are random.

In this paper, an impedance control algorithm based on velocity is proposed. The practical difficulties
mentioned above of impedance control and the environmental stiffness that cannot be known precisely,
are satisfactorily solved in this paper by introducing feedback information of contact forces and torques
measured by force sensors. In addition, a desired velocity is introduced instead of the desired
displacement since the precise desired displacement cannot be deduced from the position random errors
between two LIDMs. A relational function between contact force and velocity of load sensing ring 1s
designed in this algorithm to track desired force as well as the shape of contact surface. Besides, a filter
is set in this algorithm as the control law of contact forces and torques of two LIDMs. The filter, which

----$$$$----$$$$----
Sensors 2014, 14 23000

can directly affect each of the contact forces and torques, can affect the trajectory whereby the LIDM
responds to the same external forces and torques by changing the filtering functions, and a group of
suitable filtering functions may result in a better trajectory for the capturing process. In order to validate
the algorithm, a series of simulations with MATLAB and ADAMS are presented. First of all, the
governing equation between deviation of forces and velocity of an impedance controller is derived, and
simulations are carried out to validate how impedance parameters affect the control characteristics. Then,
the model of LIDM is built in ADAMS referring to the Low Impact Docking System of NASA, and a
control module of LIDM is generated in ADAMS. Finally, the control system is built in MATLAB via
the usage of the control module. The results of capturing simulations demonstrate that impedance control
based on velocity is suitable for the LIDM, as well as, that the present algorithm is robust and the filter
is necessary for the impedance control system.

2. Features of the LIDM and Dynamic Model

The LIDM comprises a six-DOF platform, a tunnel and a control subsystem [1,2]. As shown in
Figure la, the six-DOF platform is composed of a load sensing ring, a base ring, one or more
electromagnets, one or more striker plates, a plurality of actuators, and a plurality of alignment guides.
The load sensing ring and the base ring are coupled together using several actuators, base connection
points and upper connection points. Structurally, the load sensing ring is comprised of an annular outer
face, an inner face and a variety of load cells as shown in Figure 1b.

In addition, the six-DOF platform incorporates an active load sensing system so as to automatically
and dynamically adjust the load ring during capture, instead of requiring significant force to push and
realign the load ring. Unlike the mechanical trip latches that require a tripping force for capture, the
LIDM uses electromagnets to achieve “soft” capture. Furthermore, the LIDM could also be controlled
as a damper in lieu of interconnected linear actuators and separate load attenuation system, to eliminate
the residual motion and dissipate the forces resulted from ramming two vehicles together. Therefore, the
contact force and torque fluctuations can be maintained within a small range, and according to
reference [18], it can be known that the maximum of contact forces and torques are not more than 450 N
and 450 N-m, respectively. The dynamic model of the LIDM can be expressed as follows:

M(q)q+C@9.Qqt+gQaFktFk,+F, (1)

where M(q), C(q), g(q) represent the inertia matrix, centrifugal term and gravity term respectively; q
represents the six-DOF generalized coordinate vector of the load sensing ring; F,, Fr and Fe represent the
generalized driving force vector, generalized friction force vector and generalized external force vector
respectively. In this paper, each generalized force is named “Force” below, which represents a
six-dimensional vector and contains three forces and three torques along three axes of the coordinate.
Similarly, the generalized displacement and the generalized velocity are named “Displacement” and
“Velocity” respectively below. F is given from reference [19]:

F=J'f (2)

where J represents the Jacobian Matrix, f= [fi 23/45 fe]! represents the driving force matrix of actuators.
In addition, there should be a certain relationship between external force and load cells as described
previously, which can be expressed as follows.

Firstly, two coordinate frames are defined, namely O-XYZ and O1-X1YiZ1, which are fixed to the base
ring and the load sensing ring respectively as shown in Figure 1. Then, the coordinates of load cell
connection points ai and Ai can be described in O1-X1Y1Z1. Through the screw theory [20], the Jacobian
Matrix Js' and the external Force in O1-X1¥1Zi can be obtained, as expressed below:

J. = Axa, A,Xa, A,X, ©)
a, — A|| la, — A,| la, — A,
F.=J, f. (4)

where ai and Ai represent the coordinates of the upper and the base connection points of load cells
separately in O1-X1Y1Z1, Fe' represents the external Force vector in O1-X1YiZ1, fs is a vector composed
of the values of six load cells. Thus, the external Force vector in O-XYZ can be described as follows:

F,=RF.=RJ'f. (5)

where R 1s the rotation matrix transformed from O1-X1YiZi to O-XYZ, and can be expressed as:
l 0 0 cos(B) 0 sin(f) || cos(@) —sin(~) 0
R=|0 cos(@) —sin(@) 0 1 0 sin(@) cos(@”) 0O
0 sin(@) cos(@) | —sin(f) 0 cos(f) 0 0 l

----$$$$----$$$$----

where a, /, 8 represent the Euler angles about axes Z, Y, X respectively. According to Equations (2) and
(5), the dynamic model of LIDM can be rewritten as:

M(q)g+C(g.gq+gqQ=J'ft+F,+RJ f. (6)
3. The LIDM Control System
3.1. The Flexible Model of LIDM

The LIDM is a rigid structure system, but when controlled by a force tracking control system, it can
be treated as a flexible system with spring and damper characteristics. Therefore, the LIDM is supposed
to be a mass-spring-damper system. The supposed model along one direction is shown in Figure 2, where
md, ka, and ba represent the mass, stiffness and damping respectively, x and xa represent the actual
displacement and the desired displacement respectively, f; and f represent the desired force and the
external force respectively. The flexibility of supposed model is determined by parameters ma, ka, and
ba, which are selected based on Equation (6). According to the flexible model of LIDM, the governing
equation of an impedance controller can be built as descried in next section.

Figure 2. The flexible model of LIDM.

3.2. Impedance Controller Based on Velocity

The impedance control is based on the concept that it is neither position nor force, but the dynamic
relationship between them that should be controlled [6]. In this section, g is replaced by X for the purpose
of mathematical tractability, where X represents the six-DOF generalized coordinate vector of load
sensing ring. According to Figure 2, the relation is an impedance equation given by:

M, (X-X,)+ By (X-X,)+K (X-X)=E (7)

where E represents the deviation of Force between the external Force and the desired Force, while
E = F. — F;, in which F; represents the desired Force; X and Xa represent the actual Displacement and
the desired displacement, respectively; Ma, Ba and Ka are respectively 6 x 6 constant-positive-diagonal
matrices of desired inertial, damping and stiffness. Apparently, a desired Displacement is necessary for
an impedance control system based on the position from Equation (7). However, the desired
Displacement of load sensing ring cannot be obtained, since the initial docking conditions of LIDM are
random. Therefore, an impedance control method based on velocity is introduced to solve this problem.
Thus, the relationship between force and velocity can be expressed as follows:

----$$$$----$$$$----
Sensors 2014, 14 23003

M,V -V,)+B,V -V,)+ K,|V -V, )dt = E (8)

where V and Va represent actual Velocity and desired Velocity, respectively. When the initial docking
conditions are zero, Equation (8) can be expressed in the Laplace domain as follows:

M s[V(s)-V,(s)]+ ByV (s) -Va(s)]+ KV (8) -Via(s) Vs = E(s) (9)

Let:
V;(s) =V(s)-V(s) (10)

where Vf (s) represents the Velocity offset, thus, the Vr (s) can be obtained from Equation (9), and
expressed as follows:
E(s)s

V.(s) = —___+"—_
r(s) M,s° +B s+K, (1)

According to Equation (11), the structure diagram of the impedance controller is established as shown
in Figure 3. If there is no external Force on the LIDM (e.g., Fe = 0) and the desired Force is assumed to
equal to zero (e.g., Fr = 0), the motion of load sensing ring follows the desired Velocity. Conversely, the
motion of the load sensing ring is controlled by the correction of Velocity and the desired

Velocity simultaneously.

According to Equation (11) and Figure 3, the dynamic relationship between deviation of Force and
correction of Velocity can be adjusted to adapt to external environment by changing the impedance
parameters. Detail information about how impedance parameters affect control characteristics will be

shown in the next section.
3.3. The Influences of Impedance Parameters on Control Characteristics

The purpose of impedance control based on velocity is to achieve an ideal dynamic relationship
between the velocity of the load sensing ring and external forces by choosing a set of suitable impedance
parameters. Thus, it is necessary to research how to choose the suitable impedance parameters. In this
section, three simulations in one direction are presented to introduce how the impedance parameters
affect control characteristics. The input function of simulations is a step function, and the results are

shown in Figures 4—6.

The first simulation shows how inertial parameter Ma affects control characteristics by changing the
value of Ma and keeping Ka and Ba constant, while Ka = 200 N/mm, Ba = 2000 Kg/s. According to
Figure 4, the inertial parameter Ma of the impedance controller primarily affects the reaction rate of the
responses. If a lower value is selected for Ma, there will be a rapid response to external forces, but it will

----$$$$----$$$$----
Sensors 2014, 14 23005

result in a larger acceleration on actuators simultaneously. On the contrary, if a larger value is
selected for Ma, the response rate of the impedance controller would be slow, resulting in a stronger
external force.

The second simulation shows how damping parameter Ba affects control characteristics by changing
the value of Ba and keeping Ka and Ma constant, while Ka = 200 N/mm, Ma = 100 Kg. According to
Figure 5, the damping parameter of the impedance controller primarily affects the peak and regulation
time of responses. With the increase of Ba, the peak of response decreases, and the regulation time
reduces first and then increases. When the value of Ba is equal to zero, the response of the impedance
controller is undamped oscillation and the regulation time approaches to infinity. The vibration of
response is not suitable for the compliance of LIDM, because it could result in an enormous
external force.

The third simulation shows how the stiffness parameter Ka affects the control characteristics by
changing the value of Ka and keeping Ma and Ba constant, while Ma = 100 Kg, Ba = 2000 Kg/s.
According to Figure 6, 1t can be concluded that the stiffness parameter Ka of the impedance controller
primarily affects the attenuation of response. When Ka is equal to zero, there is no attenuation.
Additionally, the decay rate of response would increase, if the value of Ka increases.

According to the results of simulations, if one or more of contact forces or/and torques are more than
the maximum of requirements of low impact, a smaller Ma should be selected to decrease them by
increasing the reaction rate of the responses. The damping parameter Ba must be maintained in a certain
range where the oscillation of LIDM can be eliminated. When one or more of contact forces or/and
torques are over the maximum of requirements of low impact, a greater Ba should be selected to decrease
them by increasing the peak of responses. The stiffness parameter Ka of the impedance controller
primarily affects the attenuation of responses. It is positive to maintain two LIDMs constant contact with
each other during the process of capturing when the responses can decay (e.g., Ka > 0) in this control
system. However, some larger internal forces of LIDM may be caused, if one greater Ka is selected.

3.4. The LIDM Model in ADAMS and the Control Module in MATLAB

The model of LIDM built in ADAMS is shown in Figure 7. In order to simplify the simulations, the
inoperative parts of LIDM are removed. The ADAMS model comprises two docking assemblies, the
active docking assembly (below in Figure 7) and the passive docking assembly (above in Figure 7).

Figure 7. The LIDM model built in ADAMS.


----$$$$----$$$$----
Sensors 2014, 14 23006

The active docking assembly is composed of base ring, actuators and load sensing ring. The passive
docking assembly is only comprised of annular outer face and alignment guides. Contact forces and
torques of two docking assemblies, delivered to the impedance controller, can be measured by load
sensing ring in real-time. The actuators can receive velocity signals from impedance controller to adjust
the position and posture of load sensing ring. Besides, the initial docking conditions of two LIDM can
be set through adjusting the position and posture of passive docking assembly.

The ADAMS model can be used to generate a control module through “controls” of soft ADAMS.
The control module of LIDM in MATLAB 1s shown in Figure 8. Vj, vi, v2, v3, v4, v5, Vo are input variables
of the control module, where V; represents the relative closing speed of two LIDMs, and v1, v2, v3, v4, vs,
v6 represent the driving velocities of six actuators. a, 6, 0, x, y, z, fil, f2, fh, f4, fs, fo , 8 are the output
variables, where fi, 2, 3, /4, 5, f6 represent the values of the load cells, and s represents the relative

distance single of two LIDMs, through which completion of capture tasks can be detected.

3.5. The Components of the Control System

The desired Force provides desired forces and torques along three Cartesian axes, which represents
the ideal interaction Force between the two LIDMs. The input of impedance control part is the difference
between actual external Force Fe and desired contact Force F;. The output is Velocity offset Vs. V:;
represents the actual Velocity of load sensing ring in Cartesian-space which has been adjusted to adapt
to the docking environment, while V;= V+ Va. vr is driving velocity vector of six actuators, converted
from velocity V; by equation v;= J Vr. The length vector of six actuators / can be converted to the position
and attitude angles (i.e., x, y, z, a, 6, 0) of load sensing ring in Cartesian coordinates by forward solution.
In addition, the control module is generated in ADAMS, which is the interface between ADAMS and
MATLAB, and contacts the LIDM model in ADAMS with control system in MATLAB. Therefore, the
control module can be seen as a MATLAB module that has the same effect on the model in ADAMS.
In order to reduce computational complexity, x, y, z, a, 6, 9 can be directly obtained from control module,
thus the forward solution in this simulation is unnecessary. However, this method is not suitable for
physical test. Besides, the values of load cells can be converted to the contact Forces Fe in
Cartesian-space through Jacobian matrix RJs!.

A filter is set in the feedback loop to control the values of external Forces passing the filter. When
any one of the absolute values of input forces and torques of filter (except Fey) is less than or equal to
critical value, the output of it is equal to zero, on the contrary, the output value is equal to input. In
addition, whatever the input value is, the output of filter about Fey is always equal to zero. The filter can
not only remove some interference from environment, but also control the sensitivity about forces and
torques along three Cartesian axes, which determines who responses to the same input data first. Without
filter, the docking of two LIDMs may not be successful.

4.2. Simulation of the Capturing Process of Two LIDMs

The purpose of the simulation is to study whether impedance control based on velocity is suitable for
low impact docking of LIDMs or not. In this simulation, the impedance controller controls the velocity
of actuators, so the load sensing ring can track the desired Force F; = [0,0,0,0,0,0]' as well as the desired
Velocity Va = [0,0,0,0,0,0]'. The results are shown in Figures 11-19, where alpha, beta, and theta
represent a, /, 6 respectively.

Figures 11 and 12 show the simulation results of Case 1. The initial contact time of two LIDMs 1s
close to 27 s, and the contact forces do not exceed 150 N and torques do not exceed 60 N-m during the
capturing process.

Figures 13 and 14 show the simulation results of Case 2. The initial contact time of two LIDMs 1s
around 19 s, and the contact forces do not exceed 200 N and torques do not exceed 100 N-m during the
process of capturing.

close to 27.5 s, and the contact forces do not exceed 200 N and torques do not exceed 40 N-m during the

Figures 18 and 19, the initial contact time of two LIDMs 1s close to 16 s, and the contact forces do not

Figures 11—19, it is easy to find out that there exist some larger forces or torques changing suddenly in
all the results of simulations. This phenomenon is triggered by changing the type of contact of two
LIDMs from one to another.

According to the simulation results of the four cases, it can be concluded that the contact forces and
torques between two LIDMsS are instantly translated to adapt to the docking environment with impedance
control based on velocity, and the contact forces and torques can be controlled in a small range during
the process of capturing. Furthermore, the maximum of contact force and torque are less than 250 N and
150 N-m, respectively, in simulations meeting the requirements, the maximum of contact force and
torque are not more than 450 N and 450 N-m, respectively, of docking two LIDMs with low impact
forces. Besides, the instantaneous stronger forces are caused by changing the type of contact of two
LIDMs from one to another suddenly.

4.3. The Influences of Filtering Functions on Control Characteristics

The purpose of this section is to study how filter affects the control characteristics of LIDM. In this
section, another filtering function is given as shown in Equation (13). So the corollary can be obtained
by comparing results of two simulations. The results are present in Figures 20—25:

(i= X,2Z; / =X, y,Z) (13)

As shown in Figures 20—25, the largest contact force is close to 4000 N while the largest contact
torque is more than 300 N-m. Comparing the forces and torques of Figures 20 and 21 with
Figures 18 and 19, the largest contact force and torque based on Equation (13) are far more than the
values based on Equation (12). Besides, the largest value of force changing suddenly is far more than
the value of normal forces during the process of capturing. By comparison, the filter based on
Equation (12) is more suitable for the process of capturing, because the sensitivity of forces and torques
along three axes of filter has more significant influences during capture.

The final values of translation displacement and angular displacement are shown in Figures 22—25.
Two simulations are consistent with the same initial docking conditions as shown in Table 2, but the
process of moving is entirely different. Without prewired movement path in this method, the motion of
load sensing ring is not regular. Thus, how to set the sensitivities about forces and torques of filter along
three axes in Cartesian can affect the moving path of the load sensing ring in a manner. In summary, it

can be concluded that a filter with suitable filtering functions might greatly improve the capturing process.

5. Conclusions

In the capturing simulation by ADAMS and MATLAB, the results of force tracking based on suitable
filtering functions are satisfactory. The contact forces and torques of two LIDMs are controlled in a
small rang, that the maximum of contact force and torque are not more than 250 N and 150 N-m,
respectively, meeting the requirements of docking two LIDMs with low impact forces. In particular, the
control system can maintain the contact forces/torques close to expected values when the initial docking
conditions are random. Thus, the impedance control algorithm based on velocity is robust and the control
system is suitable for LIDM. Although the results are effective, there is still space or room for
improvement to reduce the values of contact forces and torques, possibly by choosing more proper
impedance parameters or filtering functions.
