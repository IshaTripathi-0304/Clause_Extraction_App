The paper presents the kinematics of mutual movement of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a ground target. The controlled
observation and tracking head (OTH) is a device responsible for observing the ground, searching for a ground target, and tracking
it. The preprogrammed movement of the UAV on the circle with the simultaneous movement of the head axis on Archimedes spiral
during searching for a ground target, both fixed (bunkers, rocket missiles launching positions, etc.) and movable (tanks, infantry
fighting vehicles, etc.), is considered. Dynamics of OTH during the performance of the above mentioned activities is examined.

Some research results are presented in a graphical form.

1. Introduction

Due to the advantages of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)
in relation to manned aircrafts, the multitask UAVs have
become the basic equipment of a modern army [1]. They
can carry out various tasks, such as aerial and radiolocation
reconnaissance, observation of the battlefield, radioelectronic
fight, adjustment of the artillery fire, target identification,
laser indication of the target, assessment of the effects of
striking other types of weapons, and imitation of air targets.
UAVs can also have a wide civilian application, for example,
observation and control of pipelines, electric tractions and
road traffic. Because of that, more than 250 UAV models are
developed and manufactured all over the world [2]. Many
scientific institutions are engaged in developing and identi-
fying models of dynamics and flight control of UAVs. For
instance, papers [3, 4] present the comprehensive research
on modelling the dynamics of flight of K100 UAV and
Thunder Tiger Raptor 50 V2 Helicopter, respectively. Mathe-
matical models of UAV with 6 degrees of freedom (6-DoF)

introduced on the basis of the Newton’s rules of dynamics
were presented, whereas [5] presents the methodology of
modelling the dynamics of UAV flight with the use of neural
networks. Paper [6] presents the mathematical model and the
experimental research on SUAVI. That vehicle can take off
and land vertically. The model was carried out with the use of
the Newton-Euler formalism. Moreover, the controllers for
controlling the height and stabilizing the vehicle's location
have been developed. Paper [7] describes the problem of flight
dynamics of the UAV formation with the use of models with
3 and 6 degrees of freedom.

An operation of UAV during the completion of a task is
a complex process requiring comprehensive technical means
and systems. The control system of UAV is one of the most
important systems. Its task is to measure, evaluate, and
control flight parameters, as well as properly control the
flight and observation systems. Thanks to the use of complex
microprocessor systems, the comprehensive automation of
the mentioned processes is possible. Formerly, during the
completion of a mission it was necessary to maintain bilateral

communications with the ground control point. In modern
UAVs, autonomy plays an important role during detecting
and tracking a ground target.

Paper [8] presents the model of the UAV autopilot and its
sensors in the Matlab-Simulink environment for simulation
research. Papers [9-11] pertain to planning and optimizing
the trajectory of movement of the vehicle. The aspects of
designing PID controllers for the systems of UAV flight
control have been discussed in papers [12, 13].

From the quoted review of the literature it appears that the
research mainly concentrates on UAV dynamics and control,
without the consideration of the model of movement of the
observation and tracking head (OTH) which is one of the
most significant elements of the unmanned aerial vehicle.
OTH is used for automatic searching for and tracking of
targets intended for destruction [14]. This paper presents the
mathematical model of kinematics of the movement of UAV,
the ground target, and the dynamics of the controlled head
located on the UAV deck. It needs to be emphasized that the
problem of modelling, examining the dynamics, and control
of such heads in the conditions of interferences from its base
(deck of the manoeuvring UAV) is still topical. The paper
examines this type of OTH with the built-in television and
thermographic cameras and the laser illuminator.

2. Model of Movement Kinematics of
UAV, OTH and Ground Target

General view of the process of searching for a target on the
surface of the ground by OTH from UAV deck is shown in
Figure 1, whereas the operation algorithm of OTH during
scanning the ground surface and tracking a target detected
on it is shown in Figure 2.

During the search for a ground target from UAV deck,
the axis of OTH should perform the desired movements and
circle strictly defined lines on the ground with the use of
its extension. The optical system of OTH, having a certain
viewing angle, may in this way encounter a light or infrared
signal emitted by the moving object. Therefore, one should
choose the kinematic parameters of mutual movement of
UAV deck and OTH in such a way that the likelihood of
detecting a target was the highest [15]. After locating a target,
OTH goes to the tracking mode; that is, from that moment
its axis has a specific location in space being pointed at the
target.

Figure 3 shows the kinematics of mutual movement of
the head axis and UAV during searching for a target on
the ground surface. Individual coordinate systems have the
following meaning:

Ox, ¥g%q—Earth-fixed reference system,

Cx,V,2a—coordinate system connected with target
observation line (TOL),

Cx.¥-Z,-—movable coordinate system connected with
UAV velocity vector.

The velocity of changing vector R in time, during search-
ing for and tracking a target, is as follows:

dt - (1)
+ [H (ty, t,) + I (t,, te) , (V. — V,) >

where R is vector of the mutual distance of points C and
H (during scanning the space) or points C and T (during

We project the left side of (1) on the axes of the coordinate

For the simplification of reasoning, we assume that the
movement of UAV, during searching and tracking, is done on
a horizontal plane at a set altitude H., whereas the target and
point H move in the ground plane. Then, we can assume that

account (7)—(9), (3) will have the following form:

where r is mutual distance of points C and H (during
scanning) or C and T (during tracking); x? is angle of
deflection of UAV velocity vector during scanning the ground
by the head; y“ is angle of deflection of UAV velocity vector
during the passage from preprogrammed flight to tracking
flight; and x! is angle of deflection of UAV velocity vector
during the flight tracking the detected target.

We demand that, at the moment of detecting the target,
UAV automatically is starting the passage to the flight
tracking the detected target; that is, it is moving at a set
constant distance from the target rg = R.9 cos € = const (in a
horizontal plane at a constant altitude H.).

If the mutual distance r of points C and T is different from
r-q then the angle of deflection of UAV velocity vector x, = yi
changes in accordance with the relationship:

2.1. Scanning the Ground Surface during UAV Flight on a
Circle. We assume that during scanning the set area of the
ground, UAV flight is at a constant altitude H, in a horizontal
plane on the circle of the set radius r. with constant velocity
V.. (Figure 3).
Then the preprogrammed UAV flight can be determined
from the following relationships:
Vi = @.° Te Xo = wet. (22)
At the same time, we control the head axis in such a way
that it drawn on the surface of the ground a curve in the shape
of Archimedean spiral with angular velocity

_ 27V),
Ph )

Velocity V; is to be chosen in such a way that OTH
mounted on UAV deck could in the set time t, scan densely
enough the set surface of the area in the shape of a circle of
the radius R,.

If the angle of vision of the head's optical system amounts
to ¢;, then lens coverage embraces the surface similar in shape
to a circle of the radius:

1
Pr = 5 Hebn: (24)

After detecting a target at the moment t,, UAV passes into
the tracking flight according to the relationship (12), while
the target is lit with a laser beam for the period of time t,.
Hence, the total time of the process of detecting, tracking, and
lighting the target amounts to t, = ty + ty.

3. The Model of Dynamics of the Controlled
Observation and Tracking Head

A spatial model of dynamics of the head presented in Figure 4
was adopted for the paper. OTH comprises two basic parts:
external frame and internal frame with camera. Movement
of the head is determined with the use of two angles: angle of
head deflection y,, and angle of head inclination 9, [16].

The following coordinate systems, shown in Figure 5,
have been introduced:

It should be emphasized that the mathematical model

head described with (29) allows for conducting a number of
simulation tests of searching for and tracking a ground target
from the UAV deck. Thanks to that, one can know about the
areas of stability and permissible controls with the influence
of kinematic excitations from the UAV deck.

Kinematic excitations from UAV deck adversely affect the
operation of the head. It can particularly be seen in Figures 11
and 14. In case of the nonoptimum choice of the parameters
of the regulator, the deviations of the head axis from the set
location are particularly visible (Figures 8 and 9). Smaller
values of deviations can of course be achieved for optimum
head controls (Figures 14 and 15). Control moments take
small values.

(i) it is possible to search for a target on the area of any
size, which is only limited to the durability and range
of UAV flight;

(iii) the programme of scanning the surface of the ground
is simple;

(iv) there occur relatively small values of OTH axis angle

(v) full autonomy of UAV during the mission of searching
and laser lighting of the detected ground target
secures the point of control against detection and
destruction by an enemy;

(vi) the interference of an operator in controlling UAV
may only be limited to cases of the vehicle's total com-
ing off from the set path or the loss of the target from
OTH lens coverage (due to gusts of wind, explosions
of missiles, etc.). Hence, the possibility of automatic
sending of information about such occurrences to the
control point and the possible taking of control over
UAV flight by the operator should be introduced.

5. Conclusion

The considerations presented in this paper will allow us
to conduct the research on the dynamics of OTH when
manoeuvring UAV on which this device is mounted. It may
enable the construction engineers to choose such parameters
of OTH so that the transient processes occurring in the
conditions of kinematic influence of UAV deck and at the

moment of passing from scanning to tracking mode were
minimized and disappeared in the shortest possible time.
