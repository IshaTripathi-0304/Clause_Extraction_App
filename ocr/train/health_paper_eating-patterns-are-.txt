Abstract

doi:10.1017/jns.2012.8

The association between diet and CVD cannot be assigned to a single nutrient, but rather to a set of nutrients and non-nutrients, and eating pattern analyses
have become an important tool in investigation of this relationship. Our objective was to investigate eating patterns in relation to nutrient intake and serum
concentration of folate, vitamin B,2 and TAG in ninety-five healthy adult participants. Dietary information was collected by an FFQ, and eating patterns
were obtained by principal components analyses of thirty-three food groups. Three eating patterns were extracted, a sweet eating pattern identified by
intakes of cakes, snacks, sugar-sweetened drinks and chocolates; a prudent eating pattern identified by vegetables, fruits and olive oil; and a traditional
food pattern identified by red meat, lean fish and cheese. Blood samples were collected in the morning after an overnight fast. Linear regression analyses
adjusted for age, BMI and smoking showed a negative association between the sweet eating pattern scores and the serum concentration of folate (B =
—2:31 95 % CI —4-14, —0-45)) and a positive association with serum concentration of TAG (B = 0-35 95 % CI 0-12, 0-57)). The prudent eating pattern
scores were positively associated with the serum concentration of folate (B = 1-69 (95 % CI 0-44, 2-92)). In conclusion, a sweet eating pattern was associated
with risk factors for CVD, whereas a prudent eating pattern was associated with protective factors.

Key words: Eating patterns: Biomarkers: Serum folate: TAG: CVD

An unbalanced diet contributes to the development of chronic
diseases, whereas a healthy diet promotes health and reduces
the risk. Findings from the Health Professionals Follow-Up
Study and the Nurses’ Health Study cohorts suggest that an
eating pattern associated with high consumption of fruits, veg-
etables, whole grains, lesumes and poultry (known as the
prudent pattern) is associated with a lower tisk of CVD.
An eating pattern, known as the Western pattern, and character-
ised by high consumption of refined cereals, processed and red
meats, desserts and high-fat dairy products, has been associated
with an increased risk of CHD and type 2 diabetes°. The eat-
ing pattern approach intuitively has an appeal because the
human diet does not consist of single nutrients, but of food
items composed of many nutrients. However, combination

studies referring to nutrient intake and eating patterns might
add further insight into the impact of nutrition on disease.
A reduced intake of folate, vitamins B;> and Bg results in an
increased concentration of plasma homocysteine, and an
increased concentration of plasma homocysteine has been
found to be associated with CVD“. Large epidemiological
studies have shown a clear association between intake of vita-
min B and CVD“ OT) and intervention with folic acid fortifi-
cation of grain products has resulted in reduction in stroke
mortality outcomes”. Meta-analyses of folic acid supplemen-

with elevated serum TAG concentration”. High dietary intake
of carbohydrates, especially sucrose and fructose, is known to
increase TAG concentration, and dietary patterns with a high
content of sucrose have also been associated with dyslipidae-

mia“°!'?, Thus, both nutrient intake and eating patterns are use-
ful to explore diet and disease associations. The aim of this study
was to evaluate eating patterns in relation to nutrient intake and
serum concentrations of folate, vitamin B;2 and TAG.

Methods
Design and subjects

Data collection was carried out from March to May 2008 at
the University of Agder, Kristiansand, Norway. This project
(ref: S-0627a, 2008/1851) was part of an intervention study
with folic acid supplementation for 2 weeks, where the partici-
pants wete given 800 ueg/folic acid per d in a double-blind
cross-over trial. Healthy students and employees were invited
to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy,
those on medication and use of vitamin B supplements for
the last 3 months. Different approaches were used to recruit
the participants. The students were contacted in the student
canteen and the employees were recruited from three different
faculties and among the technical and library staff. This study
was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the
Declaration of Helsinki and all procedures involving human
subjects were approved by the Regional Committee of
Ethics and the Data Inspectorate in Norway. Written informed
consent was obtained from all subjects.

Blood sample

Blood samples were collected in the morning between 07.30
and 08.30 hours after an overnight fast. The blood samples
were placed on ice and plasma was isolated within 30 min.
The serum and plasma samples were stored at —80°C. The
concentrations of serum folate, vitamin B,. and TAG were
measured with a Cobas 6000 at the Laboratory of Medical
Biochemistry, Sorlandet Hospital, Arendal. The analytical
method for the measurement of serum TAG has a CV of
2:0—2:6 %. The analytical methods for the measurement of
serum folate and vitamin B,, have a CV of 5 and 10%,
respectively.

Dietary data

A validated semi-quantitative FFQ was used for the dietary
information, which included 255 different food items grouped
into twenty-six main questions. In the FFQ, habitual dietary
intake for the last 12 months was asked. Nutrient calculations
were performed with the use of FoodCalc, a software program
for nutrient calculation on the Internet”, and the Norwegian
Food Composition table©”. All participants had a calculated
energy intake between 4500 and 20 000 kJ”. A total of thirty-
three different food groups were included in the principal
components factors analysis to identify independent clusters
of eating patterns. In all, three different food patterns were

recognised with an eigenvalue >2-5 and accounting for 34%
of the total variation. The three patterns were extracted on
the basis of the scree plot and the factor loading matrix was
evaluated after orthogonal (varimax) rotation. Food groups
with loadings >0-4 were used to identify the eating patterns.
For each participant, factor scores were produced by multiply-
ine factor loadings with the standardised value for each food
and summing across the food items. These factor scores
were used for further analyses. A high factor score will indicate
a high intake of the foods in the special food pattern, and a
negative factor score will indicate a low intake of foods in
that pattern.

Statistics

Data ate given as mean values and standard deviations if
normally distributed and as median and interquartile range if
non-normally distributed. Group differences for normally
distributed variables were analysed using independent samples
¢ tests and skewed distribution group differences were analysed
with the Mann—Whitney U test. The x* test was used for
nominal data. To investigate correlations between factor
sores and nutrient intakes, we used the Spearman correlation
coefficient. Multiple linear regression models were built with
serum folate, vitamin B,. and TAG as dependent variables
and factor scores of the food patterns were added as continu-
ous variables. The models were checked for normality of the
residuals and because of non-normality the model for vitamin
By could not be used. In all regression models, all three eating
patterns were included in addition to energy as suggested by
Newby ef al©*). In the adjusted models, age, sex, smoking
categories (non-smokers and daily smokers) and BMI were
adjusted. All analyses were performed using PASW version
18 (SPSS Inc.) and P<0-05 was regarded as statistically
sienificant.

Results

We recruited forty-five university students and fifty-three uni-
versity employees. Blood samples from ninety-five subjects
wete available for biochemical analyses (Table 1). There was
no significant difference between the groups except for age.
Mean age was 52 years among employees and 23 years
among the students. Intake of energy and nutrients was similar
in the two groups, except intake of added sugar, where the stu-
dents had a higher intake.

In all, three different eating patterns were extracted with the
use of the principal components analysis method: a ‘sweet’ eat-
ing pattern that was identified by sweets and snacks; a prudent
eating pattern identified by vegetables, fruits and poultry; and a
traditional eating pattern identified by red meat, fish products
and boiled potatoes and jam (Table 2). There was a statistically
sienificant difference in food intake between the first and third
tertile in the sweet and prudent eating patterns, but not for the
traditional eating pattern (data not shown). The sweet eating
pattern score correlated positively with the total intake of
energy, protein, fat and carbohydrate (Table 3). When energy
adjusted the correlations with protein, fibre, folate and vitamin

Bi2 were changed and negatively correlated. The prudent eat-
ing pattern correlated positively with the intake of fibre, folate
and vitamin C, and these correlations did not change when
energy was adjusted. The traditional eating pattern correlated
positively with protein, fat, carbohydrates, fibre and fat, but
not with the energy-adjusted intakes.

Significantly, more employees than students were cate-
gorised in the third tertile of the traditional eating pattern,
55% compared with 9% (P<0-001, x test), while there
was no significant difference between the two groups for
adherence to the sweet and prudent eating patterns. Of the
males, 12 % were categorised in the third tertile for the pru-
dent diet, while 41% of the females were categorised into
this tertile (P = 0-001).

The concentrations of serum folate, vitamin B,2 and TAG
did not differ between the students and the employees
(Table 1). Serum folate concentration was positively associated
with energy-adjusted intake of folate (8 = 0-03, P= 0-001). In
the sweet eating pattern, serum folate concentration decreased
with increased adherence, whereas in the prudent eating pat-
tern serum folate concentration increased with increased
adherence (Table 4). No association was identified for serum
vitamin B,2 concentration and the tertiles of the eating pat-
terns, but there was a positive correlation between the
enerey-adjusted calculated intake and the serum concentration
of vitamin B,» (B = 0-03, P= 0-005). For the sweet eating pat-
tern, there was a positive association with the serum concen-
tration of TAG, whereas there was a negative association
with the prudent eating pattern and serum TAG. The serum
concentration of TAG was significantly associated with intake

In the multiple regression models, adherence to the sweet
eating pattern was negatively associated with serum folate con-
centration, whereas adherence to the prudent diet was posi-
tively associated with serum folate concentration (Table 5).
Adherence to the sweet eating pattern was positively associated
with TAG concentration.

The sweet eating pattern was identified by intake of cakes,
snacks, sugar-sweetened drinks and chocolates, and the pru-
dent eating pattern was identified by intake of vegetables, fruits
and olive oil. The traditional food pattern was identified by
intake of red meat and cheese. In the multiple linear
regressions, we found that the sweet eating pattern was nega-
tively associated with serum folate concentration and positively
with increased serum concentration of TAG, while the pru-
dent eating pattern was associated with an increase in serum
folate concentration.

Dietary patterns have been recognised as useful tools in
nutritional science to evaluate the multidimensional nature of

diets-”, In dietary studies with disease outcomes, different
methods have been used to construct not only eating patterns,
such as the Healthy Eating Index, but also posterior methods
such as cluster and factor analyses have been used. However,
vety few studies have exploited biomarkers in relation to
different food patterns“, In the present study, we investi-
gated eating patterns developed by principal components
analysis, which is a data-driven statistical method designed to
isolate and identify independent clusters.

Our extraction with the sweet eating pattern explaining most
of the variance was surprising, because in many studies most
variance is explained by the healthy (i.e. a prudent) or the tra-
ditional eating pattern®*”, Although students had a higher
intake of added sugar compared with the employees, as
many of the students were ranked in the third tertile of the
sweet eating pattern as the employees. This might indicate
that students are a less homogeneous group, with both
health-conscious and not-so health-conscious individuals,
and students are known to have a more irregular life style.
The only eating pattern that was preferred by the employees
was the traditional eating pattern, indicating a different life
style in the two groups”. It has been demonstrated that
women more often adhere to a prudent diet, i.e. eat more veg-
etables, and that was also seen with this method, where signifi-
cantly more women were included in the third tertile of the
prudent eating pattern”.

Calculated nutrient intake correlated significantly with the
sweet and the traditional eating pattern scores, similar to
results from earlier studies~>. However, adjusted for energy,
the correlations were negative between the nutrients and the
sweet eating pattern, which indicates a poor-nutrient-dense
pattern (ie. nutrient per kJ). The energy adjustment of fibre,
folate, vitamin B,2 and vitamin C did not remove the cortre-
lations with the prudent eating pattern, confirming a more
nutrient-dense eating pattern.

An increase in serum folate concentration with increased
adherence to the prudent eating pattern and a reduction
with adherence to the sweet eating pattern might indicate an
association between these patterns. This was not seen and
would have also been in disagreement with the principal com-
ponents analysis method”. In the linear regression model, the
inclusion of all three patterns did not weaken the associations,

which indicates that the three patterns were not correlated
factors.

None of the extracted dietary patterns correlated with serum
vitamin B,> concentration. Important sources of vitamin By,»
are animal proteins, and although only meat and fish were
identified in the traditional food pattern, all participants had
a diet including both meat and fish. An evenly distributed
intake of these food items in the three eating patterns might
explain why vitamin B,2 did not correlate with any of the
extracted eating patterns in the present study, while there
still was a positive correlation between calculated vitamin
By> intake and the serum concentration.

A high concentration of serum TAG 1s an indicator and pre-
dictor of CVD, and has been shown to correlate with intake of
disaccharides”. In the present study, we found a positive
association between TAG and the sweet eating pattern and
an indication of an inverse association with the traditional eat-
ing pattern. The sweet eating pattern was also the only eating
pattern that correlated with the intake of added sugar. The
positive associations with TAG and the sweet eating pattern
add strength to the association between sugar intake and CVD.

The present study is limited by the low power, with only
ninety-five participants, and by a selected population consisting
of university students and employees. Furthermore, with an
FFQ it is impossible to register all food items eaten by an indi-
vidual, and the nutrient calculations are always dependent on the
quality of the nutrient database. However, the study included
only healthy individuals who were not on medication and with-
out vitamin B food supplements during the last 3 months. In
addition, folate fortification was not present in Norwegian
food at the time of the study inclusion. In most epidemiological
studies, this factor is impossible to adjust for because medi-
cation ot food supplements are rarely reported. Furthermore,
in Norway there is virtually no fortification with vitamins and
minerals, which strengthen the nutrient calculations.

In conclusion, the present findings indicate that adhering to
the prudent eating pattern is associated with reduced known
risk factors for CVD, whereas adhering to the sweet eating pat-
tern may be associated with increased risk for chronic disease.
The eating pattern approach is interesting and can be used in
epidemiological studies in combination with the more traditional
nutrient approach to shed light on the impact of diet on disease.
