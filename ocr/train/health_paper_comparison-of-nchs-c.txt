Introduction

The monitoring of growth and nutritional status during
childhood and adolescence enables the early diagnosis of
potential problems such as malnutrition, overweight, or
obesity in adulthood.! For this evaluation, anthropometry is
an important tool for the analysis of children’s health and
nutritional status. In the last three decades, the use of two sets
of growth curves, by the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS/1977) and by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC 2000),*°> has predominated. The 1977 reference
has some limitations, such as samples consisting mostly
of formula-fed children, all from North America, among
others.® To try to minimize some of the problems of the
previous reference curves, the CDC reconstructed the
1977 reference using a series of modifications, releasing
it in the year 2000. The sample of children was increased,
incorporating data of children who had been breastfed, more
modern statistical methods were used, and the body mass
index (BMI) was included, among other changes.’

In 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) established
the new standard for infant growth, based on a multicenter
study involving six countries: Brazil (Pelotas), Ghana (Accra),
India (New Delhi), Norway (Oslo), Oman (Muscat), and United
States (Davis). The sample of assessed children and their
families should comprise different eligibility criteria, including:

exclusive breastfeeding at four months of age; intention to
follow the dietary recommendations; socioeconomic situation
that would not hinder the child’s growth; mother who did not
smoke before and after delivery.? The use of this standard
was recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health in
2007, and the growth curves were included in the Child
Health Handbook.?° In the same year, this new standard was
extended to children aged between 5 and 19 years, after the
analysis of the original NCHS/1977 sample, by using advanced
statistical methods.!t3

There have been few studies in literature that compared
the three curves and included children who already had
cardiovascular risk factors treated at referral centers. Most
studies that compared the curves assessed children younger
than 5 years from unselected populations, where the proportion
of children at risk is much lower. There is evidence that the
atherosclerotic process begins in childhood and progresses
with age, and that its severity is directly proportional to the
number of risk factors displayed by the individual."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the new
WHO/2006 curves with the old NCHS/1977 and CDC/2000 curves,
regarding the nutritional status of children and adolescents
aged 2 to 19 years treated at the Pediatric Preventive Cardiology
Clinic (ACPP) of the Instituto de Cardiologia de Porto Alegre (IC/
FUG), and to describe the proportion of children with diagnostic
disagreement between the three curves, identifying their
nutritional profile and the associated risk factors.

Methods

This study was carried out with a database obtained from a
cohort study, started in 2001 by the research group of ACPP
- IC/FUC, entitled “Risk factors for ischemic heart disease
in children and adolescents: primary prevention and early
detection outpatient strategy”.

For the present study, data were extracted from specific
cohort files, comprising 522 evaluations of 118 individuals aged
2 to 19 years. The BMI analyses were performed using data
from 522 evaluations and, in order to verify result validity, an
analysis was carried out with data from the first consultation
of 118 patients. The study included individuals who had
associated cardiovascular risk factors, such as dyslipidemia,
obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and family
history. Fifteen individuals were excluded from the study due
to incomplete data in the file, or loss to follow-up, as well as
those with some type of congenital heart disease.

Three indices were analyzed to assess the nutritional
status of the studied population: weight/age (W/A), height/
age (H/A), and BMI. These indices were obtained by comparing
the information on weight, height, age, and gender of the
patients from the original study. Weight was measured
using a Welmy digital scale accurate to 0.1 kg, coupled to the
scale stadiometer, accurate to 0.1 cm. These measures were
collected by properly trained interns or professionals from
the outpatient clinic, so that data collection standards were
maintained.

The collected data were classified and analyzed according
to the NCHS/1977, the CDC/2000, and the WHO/2006 reference
curves. The BMI variable was compared only to the CDC/2000
and WHO/2006 references (the NCHS/1977 has no classification
for BMI). The weight/age (W/A) and height/age (H/A) variables
were compared using the NCHS/1977, CDC/2000, and
WHO/2006 references; however, as the WHO/2006 reference
has no classification of these two variables for ages above
10 years, it was decided to only assess children under
10 years using the three references, totaling 50 evaluations.
The WHO/2006 curves were adopted by the Brazilian Ministry
of Health and the Food and Nutrition Surveillance System
(Sistema de Vigilancia Alimentar e Nutricional - SISVAN),'* and
are adopted nationally as the gold standard regarding the
nutritional status of children and adolescents.

The cutoff points for BMI according to the WHO/2006 curves
are underweight, percentile < 3; adequate weight, 3 < percentile
< 85; overweight, 85 < percentile < 97; and obesity, percentile
> 97.14 The cutoffs for W/A according to the curves are very low
weight for age, percentile < 0.1; low weight for age, 0.1 < percentile
< 3; adequate weight for age, 3 < percentile < 97; and excess
weight for age, percentile = 97. As for the H/A criterion, the
following classification was used: low stature, percentile < 3;
adequate height for age, percentile > 3.14 For the BMI assessment,
data from 522 patients were considered, and for the assessment
of W/A and H/A, a subsample of 50 subjects was selected.

Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) release 11.0. Continuous
variables were described as means and standard deviations
or medians and interquartile ranges. Percentiles obtained

in the three curves were compared using concordance
analysis; the non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used for
BMI, and the non-parametric Friedman’s test was used for
the others. Two analyses were performed: one considering
only the first assessment of each patient (n = 118) to describe
the frequencies. The other analysis included all other
evaluations regarding the concordance. Significance was
set at p< 0.05.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Instituto de Cardiologia do Rio Grande do Sul, protocol No.
4401/09 of December 18, 2009.

Results

A total of 118 children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years were
studied, with a total of 522 evaluations (from 1 to 17 evaluations
per patient, with a mean of 4.35). The general characteristics of
the study population are shown in Table 1. The prevalences of
overweight and obesity according to the different references
are shown in Table 2.

Figure 1 shows the distribution of the population
according to BMI in percentiles, using the CDC/2000 and
WHO/2006 references. The WHO reference shows a significant
increase in obesity when compared to the CDC reference, and
a consequent reduction in normal weight and overweight
(p < 0.001). When the BMI prevalence values were analyzed
by gender, no statistical difference was observed (p = 0.58)
between the CDC/2000 and WHO/2006 references.

Regarding the distribution of the population with high
weight for age in years, it was observes that from the age of
5 onward there were differences among the three references,
with the WHO/2006 curves showing a higher index of high
weight for age.

Discussion

According to the results obtained, it was observed that the
study population is mostly obese, according to BMI and W/A

overweight or obese have an earlier growth spurt than the
general population,’ so children and adolescents in this study
may have had greater height for age when compared to the rest
of the population, explaining the high rate of height adequacy
in this study.

Percentiles and Z-scores are the most frequently used scales
to compare anthropometric measurements as a standard
reference.’ In this study, BMI percentiles were used, since they
were already used in clinical practice at ACPP, in addition to
being an excellent reference.

One of the best parameters to assess the nutritional status of
children and adolescents is the BMI, as it considers age, weight,
and height, and it is also applicable into adulthood.’”""8 For
evaluation according to the BMI, the WHO reference was more
sensitive for obesity, and it is indicated for the evaluation of
children and adolescents, as it allows for early identification
of children who may develop obesity. In 2009, one in three
Brazilian children was overweight; considering that excess
weight may persist into adulthood, early identification is
crucial for prompt intervention.

Obesity is associated with dyslipidemia, hypertension,
and diabetes mellitus type 2, among others.?°.7! The various
cohorts from the Bogalusa study showed that cardiovascular
risk factors are present from childhood/adolescence, and are
related to atherosclerotic lesions demonstrated in autopsy
studies of young individuals.??

Table 1 shows that this study population already presented
such associated risk factors. It is known that obesity in
childhood and adolescence tends to continue into adulthood. If
not controlled, it can lead to increased heart disease incidence
and a consequent decrease in life expectancy.*?*?° Thus,
early detection is essential for children at higher risk for the
development of obesity, so that effective control measures
can be taken to achieve a more favorable prognosis in the
long term. The WHO/2006 curves resulted in the earlier
identification of these children,’*7© as shown in Figures 1, 2,
and 4; that is, when using this reference, risk factors can be
prevented in advance. Farias et al.?” found that BMI according
to WHO/2006 tends to show greater sensitivity than that of the
CDC/2000 reference.

The weight/height criterion was not analyzed, as this type
of reference is found only for children younger than 5 years,
according to the WHO/2006, and it has maximum values of
only 145 cm and 137 cm for males and females, respectively,
according to NCHS/1977 and CDC/2000. The weight/height
data are not available for most males older than 11 years and
females older than nine years.* Moreover, 97.3% of the study
population was older than 5 years, thus the authors decided
against this type of analysis.

The results show that the study population does not have
low weight for age. The same occurs with the classification
according to the BMI, where only 0.2% of the population had
low weight.

This can be explained by the fact that the assessed children
were treated at a clinic specializing in children and adolescents
with cardiovascular risk factors, and obesity is one of the most
prevalent risk factors.

This study had some limitations, as it was retrospective;
however, data were carefully collected, considering it was

performed in a referral service. Another limitation is the fact
that up to the age of 6, the analyses were compromised, as
the total number of evaluations at this was only 25, which is
insufficient for a correct and significant analysis.

Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that
the new WHO curves are more sensitive to identify children
and adolescents with obesity, and their use is recommended for
the assessment of these individuals. These results can direct
outpatient care, as the identification and early intervention on
lifestyles can have an impact on behavior in adulthood.
