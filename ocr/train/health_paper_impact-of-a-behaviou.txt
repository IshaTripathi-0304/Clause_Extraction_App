Abstract

Background: The importance of net durability and the average useful life of a net is increasingly recognized as one
of the critical factors that determine how often nets need to be replaced. A study to assess the effect of a net care and
repair behaviour change communication (BCC) programme on net durability was conducted in one district in Eastern
Uganda with a district in a neighbouring region serving as a comparison. Both districts had received LLINs in Septem-
ber of 2012.

Methods: The intervention was comprised of radio programmes, school and community events. Two-stage cluster
sampling household surveys to assess net condition, exposure to BCC messages, and attitudes towards net care and
repair were conducted in both districts at baseline (2-3 months post net distribution) and endline (20-21 months
post distribution). Net condition was assessed using the proportionate hole index, with nets being classified as either
serviceable or too torn.

Results: The intervention led to an additional 31.2 % increased exposure to net care and repair messages in the
intervention district. Respondents in the intervention district had a more positive attitude towards net care and repair
(32 % of respondents were classified as having a very positive attitude compared to 10 % in the comparison district),
which was positively associated with the number of channels through which messages had been received (P < 0.001).
Nets belonging to respondents with a very positive attitude were more often categorized as serviceable (80.2 %)
compared to respondents with a poor/average attitude (66.4 %; odds ratio: 2.05, P = 0.028); however, this was only
observed for the net brand with the greater physical integrity. Additionally, socio-economic status was a significant
predictor of net condition. Although nets in the intervention district had significantly more repairs done per net, the
act of repairing alone did not improve net condition.

Conclusions: |n conclusion, the evaluation showed that the BCC programme resulted in improved knowledge
and attitudes towards care and repair, which impacted positively on net condition. Repairs alone were not sufficient
to improve net condition. Additional research on which care behaviours and attitudes are most associated with
improved net condition would help BCC planners hone their campaigns.

sub-Saharan Africa in recent years [1]. As many countries
have now achieved high ownership coverage with LLINs
and are approaching the universal coverage target of one
net for every two people of the population at risk as rec-
ommended by the World Health Organization (WHO)
[1], the question of how these high coverage levels can
be maintained becomes the focus of discussion. In this

context, the importance of net durability and the “average
useful life” of a net is increasingly recognized as one of
the critical factors that determine the frequency at which
nets need to be replaced, and methods to measure net
durability in the field have been established [2]. There is
a paucity of data available on how the durability of a net
is influenced by behaviour of net maintenance, care and
repair and whether behavioural change communication
(BCC) interventions could improve net life-span.

Nets are exposed to a number of factors that may
impact on its durability. Rodents have been implicated as
a major cause of net damage in some communities [3],
but also children, fire, sharp objects, and certain sleeping
materials such as mats, are mentioned by owners of bed
nets as common sources of damage [4—6]. Such damages
may be partly associated with net hanging and storing
habits, as well as other household practices around food
storage and preparation which could attract rodents.
Besides mechanical damage, washing and drying prac-
tices of nets impact on the insecticidal properties of the
net, and there is some evidence that over-washing may
also deteriorate fabric integrity [5, 7]. While it is unclear
to what extend household owners can prevent some of
these damages, it is likely that increased knowledge of net
care and awareness of potential net damage are beneficial
to improve the overall lifespan of the net.

Besides net care, repair of nets that have acquired holes
is advocated to maintain an effective barrier against the
mosquito vector and to increase overall lifespan of the
net. In this light, the early repair of small holes, before
they become bigger, has been put forward as an effec-
tive way to repair nets [6]. Where investigated, net repair
behaviour can vary considerably between regions, with
nets in some communities showing few signs of repair
[5, 8] while in others more repairs are observed [9, 10].
The effect of such repair behaviours on net longevity has
not been studied to a great extent, yet in Kenya nets that
showed signs of repair did not have an improved overall
net condition compared to unrepaired nets [5]. Authors
noted, however, that repairing of nets was not a com-
mon practice in this study site, and that nets with signs of
repair had many holes [5].

Intensive BCC programmes have been associated with
increases in LLIN use in Cameroon [11] and Zambia [12],
and with increases in other malaria preventive behav-
iours elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa [13-16]. However,
only two BCC interventions focusing on care and repair
are found in the literature. Implemented in the Gambia,
a 2006 study observed a significant increase in repair
behaviours, specifically the proportion of holes repaired,
following an intervention composed of community song
competitions and posters, but did not measure overall
durability [17]. A recent study in Nigeria, similar to the

Page 2 of 15

present one in design and scope, is described elsewhere
[18].

The main goal of this study was to determine how the
durability of a net is influenced by behaviours of net
maintenance, care and repair and whether BCC could
significantly impact on net durability.

Methods
Study areas
The study took place in Eastern Uganda. Serere district
was selected as the intervention district receiving the
BCC programme while Kaliro, a nearby district, was used
as the comparison district. The two districts are geo-
graphically and culturally similar with similar housing,
however different languages are spoken (Teso in Serere
and Lusoga in Kaliro) and districts do not share borders.
The Government of Uganda distributed 22.2 million
LLINs as part of a national universal coverage campaign
from 2012 to 2014. The intervention and comparison dis-
trict participated in the four-district pilot phase of the
universal coverage campaign (UCC) and received their
nets in September 2012.

Design of the BCC intervention programme

The net care and repair BCC programme started in the
intervention district in June 2013 (9 months post-distri-
bution) and ran for 10 months until April 2014. The cam-
paign was designed by BCC experts jointly with district
leaders, school teachers and community health workers.
Activities were conducted in two phases (June—Novem-
ber 2013 and January—April 2014; Fig. 1). The two-phase
approach was used to give planners an opportunity to
refresh campaign approaches, prevent audience fatigue
and incorporate monitoring and midline qualitative data.
Phase I was based on data from an unpublished quali-
tative study on the culture of net use in Uganda; while
phase II used data from a qualitative midline assessment
[19] and monitoring reports from phase I. Target audi-
ences for the interventions were mainly mothers and pri-
mary school children in classes P2-P7 (ages 9-15). Both
qualitative studies had identified women as the main
household members responsible for net care and repair
and children’s behaviour as a leading cause of damage.
Men were not a primary audience of the campaign but
field coordinators tried to encourage and increase male
participation. During phase I, community activities were
mostly attended by women and children. However, dur-
ing phase II, more men attended the events although
overall women were still predominant.

The key messages of the campaign focused on ben-
efits of net care, methods to take care of and repair nets
including early repair of holes and tying up the net and
net washing practices. The messages were selected based

on the theory that perceptions of malaria risk, the feasi-
bility of net care and repair, and the value of repaired nets
are vital to behaviour change, as described in the concep-
tual model by Koenker et al. [18]. The activities that were
organized were mass media and community mobilization
events. As part of the mass media activities, 3230 radio
spots, 2188 DJ mentions (i.e., short 45-s scripts) and 19
radio talk shows were aired on two radio stations in the
intervention district. In addition posters were used in
health facilities, market areas and schools of the 30 vil-
lages in which the household surveys took place.

Community mobilization events took place in the 30
villages and their associated schools and consisted of a
number of activities. Community events included com-
pound dialogues, 34 song competition events, home vis-
its, and 45 forum theatre performances, and were mainly
led by village health team (VHT) members. District
education leaders set aside two arts and craft class ses-
sions for net care and repair and created a curriculum on
this topic. School events consisted of net care and repair
classes, quizzes, debates, and music, dance and drama
competitions, and were mainly organized by teachers.
The radio shows featured community and school events
and their participants and brought district leaders and
project members to discuss net care and repair. Radio
and print materials and drama scripts were pretested
with groups of men and women to ensure the acceptabil-
ity and relevance of the messages.

The project paid for the cost of radio spots, DJ men-
tions, and talk shows, the training of teachers and VHTs,
supervision visits and public address systems and awards
for selected community activities. VHTs, troupes and
teachers were not compensated for their time but they
received allowances for food and transportation for train-
ings, the semi-final and final rounds for the song compe-
tition, the school music, dance and drama competition

Page 3 of 15

and for all forum theater events. VHTs and teachers
were also equipped with kits for demonstrating net care
and repair that were used in the school, community and
drama activities.

Uganda distributed LLINs throughout the country
as part of the main national campaign from September
2013 onwards. BCC messaging to support this campaign
was ongoing through national and regional channels
(mainly radio) to inform people about the distribution
and how to use and take care of their nets, and it is likely
that respondents in both districts were exposed to some
degree to these messages.

Surveys

The principal evaluation design was that of repeated,
cross-sectional, two-stage cluster sampling household
survey representative of the rural population of the two
selected districts participating in the LLIN distribution.
Data was collected at baseline (2-3 months post-net
distribution) and at endline (18 months post-baseline,
and 20-21 months post-distribution; Fig. 1). Qualitative
data was collected at midline to monitor the reach and
reception to the campaign and collect further insights on
behavioural motivators and barriers that could be used to
improve the programme and its methods and results are
described elsewhere [19].

A sample of 30 clusters with 15 households each (450
households) per site and time point was used. First stage
sampling involved selection of clusters using probabil-
ity proportionate to size (PPS). Clusters were taken as
villages, and the number of households in a village was
obtained from LLIN campaign registration lists. At sec-
ond stage, households were randomly selected from a
listing of all households in the village. Clusters for the
household survey were selected at baseline and main-
tained during endline while households were randomly
selected at each survey round.

Households were eligible if they had received nets as
part of the September 2012 campaign. Survey respond-
ents were at least 18 years of age. Where possible, these
respondents were the head of household or his/her
spouse. Prior to field survey activities, local authorities
and chiefs were informed of the purpose and expected
time of the survey and their support sought. Commu-
nities were sensitized and mobilized in order to obtain
maximum cooperation for the survey.

The household questionnaire asked questions regard-
ing household characterization (composition, assets etc.),
net care and repair behaviour of all nets in household,
including exposure to care and repair messages, nets
received from campaign, loss and reasons for loss, use
of nets, and care and repair behaviour of campaign nets,
including net hole assessment. The endline questionnaire

----$$$$----$$$$----

contained a number of additional questions not asked
during baseline to provide more detailed information
to assess the BCC programme. For these questions only
endline comparisons between intervention and compari-
son district are presented.

Oversampling Olyset nets at endline

During the baseline survey it was found that while the
comparison district had exclusively received the LLIN
Olyset® made from polyethylene, the intervention dis-
trict had primarily received the LLIN PermaNet® made
from polyester with only a small number of Olyset nets
distributed in a few clusters. To account for this unantici-
pated and uneven distribution, during the endline survey
Olyset nets were purposively oversampled in the three
clusters where the baseline survey had identified them
alongside PermaNet. In these clusters, following the ran-
dom sample as above, all households were visited and
interviewed if Olyset nets were present. In two of these
clusters, a nearby village was also sampled to increase
sample size. The full questionnaire was administered to
the respondents yet questionnaires were marked to dis-
tinguish them from the random sampling ones.

Outcome measures

Each campaign net found in the household was assessed
for physical condition and signs of repair after permis-
sion was given by the respondent. All sides and roof of
the net were examined for holes or repairs, with existing
holes counted and categorized into four different sizes
(size 1: 0.5—2 cm, size 2: 2-10 cm, size 3: 10-25 cm and
size 4: larger than 25 cm in diameter) based on WHO
guidelines [20]. Nets that had too many holes to count, or
were damaged severely such that large parts of the nets
were missing, were scored as having 10 size 4 holes. The
presence and number of repaired holes was noted but
these were not counted as holes. Partially repaired holes
were counted as holes and as partial repairs. Data from
the net hole assessment was transformed into the pro-
portionate Hole Index (pHI) for each net [20]. Based on
the pHI, each net was categorized as “good’, “damaged”
or “too torn’ condition [21]. Any net that is not “too torn”
is considered “serviceable”

Net attrition was calculated for the campaign nets
received and defined as the proportion of originally
received nets (as reported by the households) which had
been (1) lost overall (overall attrition) and for (2) those
nets which had been lost due to wear and tear (thrown
away, destroyed) at the time of assessment (attrition due
to wear and tear). Net survival was then defined as the
proportion of LLINs functionally surviving to time x,
which is calculated as the proportion of received nets not
given away for use by others that are still present and in

Page 4 of 15

“serviceable” condition. Nets received but given away for
use by others or stolen were excluded from the denomi-
nator for the net survival.

Data processing and analyses

A double data entry and validation system was designed
in EpiData 3.1 software. Analyses were conducted using
Stata v12.0 (StataCorp, USA). Despite the sampling
expected to generate a self-weighting sample, weighted
analyses were conducted since the cluster sizes were
found to have varying sizes. Sampling weights were com-
puted and used through use of the “svy” command in
Stata.

The socioeconomic status (SES) was calculated at the
household level based on household characteristics and
assets using a principal component analysis (PCA) and
a wealth index was created from the first component.
Households were then classified into wealth quintiles
(five) according to their index value.

To evaluate the impact of the BCC programme, com-
parisons were made between districts for each survey
round (baseline or endline), or between survey rounds
for each district, dependent on what was most relevant.
Tests of differences were analysed using Chi square tests
for categorical variables and use of Student’s t-tests for
continuous variables. For some indicators, a difference
in differences (DID) was calculated, using either logis-
tic regression or the “diff” command in Stata. The DID
calculates the effect of the intervention on an outcome
indicator by comparing difference between the change in
the outcome indicator for the intervention group to the
change for the comparison group.

A series of 11 positive and negative statements on net
care and repair (i.e., benefits of net care and repair, ease
of net care and repair) were read to respondents and
their attitudes were captured on a Likert-type scale |i.e.,
strongly disagree (—2), somewhat disagree (—1), some-
what agree (1), strongly agree (2)] during the endline
survey. Negative statements scores were inverted dur-
ing analyses. A composite index was created using these
responses to ascertain attitudes of respondents. Average
scores were generated per respondent and were classified
in three groups; poor/average attitude (<1), positive atti-
tude (1-1.5), and very positive attitude (>1.5). Ordered
logistic regression was used to determine the associa-
tion between attitude and exposure dose and attitude and
number of messages heard.

Multivariate logistic regressions were generated for
each LLIN brand (PermaNet and Olyset) separately using
the physical net condition as the outcome variable (0
“too torn’, 1 “serviceable”) and a number of predictors
were included as independent variables. Potential pre-
dictors included in the model were those known based

----$$$$----$$$$----
Helinski et al. Malar J (2015) 14:366

on previous research, those independently associated
with net condition, as well as others that the study team
believed would impact on net condition. First, a crude
model was built by assessing the relationship between
each predictor on net outcome. The final adjusted model
was arrived at by iterative removal of predictors whose
removal had no impact on the model as determined by
the Wald test, starting from least significant predictor.

Purposively sampled households

Purposively selected households were not included in the
analyses with the exception of results around net condi-
tion. Sampling weights were re-calculated and applied
when the purposively sampled households were included
in the analyses. Due to observed significant differences in
net durability between the two net brands, for the endline
dataset Olyset nets from the randomly selected house-
holds in the comparison district were compared versus
the randomly and purposively sampled Olyset nets in the
intervention district. In addition, a separate analysis was
done for nets identified as PermaNet in the intervention
district.

To ascertain that key variables were similar between
random and purposively sampled households in the
intervention district, data analyses were also done com-
paring the two groups. Besides some minor differences
in distribution of answers in multiple answer questions,
there were no differences between random and purpo-
sively sampled households when looking at key variables.

Ethical clearance

Ethical clearance was obtained from the institutional
review boards of the Vector Comparison Division of the
Uganda Ministry of Health and the Uganda National
Council for Science and Technology (SS-2982) and Johns
Hopkins School of Public Health (IRB #4534 and #5549).
In addition, oral consent from the participants was
obtained prior to the start of the interview.

Results

Response rates during baseline and endline surveys var-
ied between 94 and 100 % (i.e., 425-450 households). In
the intervention district, an additional 266 households
were purposively sampled during the endline survey to
obtain a sufficient sample of Olyset nets. This was short
of the desired 425 due to limited number of clusters in
which Olyset had been found at baseline and the total
number of households available in these clusters.

Household characterization

Respondents were mainly female and the head of
the household or the spouse in both districts. Age of
respondents was similar between districts and was on

Page 5 of 15

average 39.9 years (P = 0.708). Significant differences
were observed in the education level of the respondents,
these were overall higher in the comparison district. In
contrast, reading abilities were significantly better in the
intervention district, where 63.4 % of respondents were
able to read to some degree compared to 51.4 % in the
comparison district (P < 0.001). The percent of house-
holds that had children in school classes P2—P7 (approxi-
mately 9-15 years of age) was similar between districts
and was on average 71.9 % of households.

Radio ownership was similarly high for both dis-
tricts and at endline ownership was on average 71.8 %
(P = 0.307). During baseline it was observed that the
comparison district had significantly more households
belonging to higher wealth quintiles than the interven-
tion district (P < 0.001). Therefore, wealth quintiles were
created separately for each district to determine if there
was a change in distribution from baseline to endline. In
the comparison district, no differences were observed in
SES between endline and baseline surveys. In the inter-
vention district, more households during endline were
classified into higher wealth quintiles compared to base-
line figures (P = 0.027).

Food was stored regularly in sleeping rooms in both
districts (69.8 %; P = 0.317). In the intervention district,
cooking occurred in rooms also used for sleeping signifi-
cantly more often, although this happened only in 10 %
of households (P = 0.004). Presence of rodents were
reported in the large majority of households in both dis-
tricts, more so in the comparison district (95.7 %) com-
pared to the intervention district (90.2 %; P = 0.009).

Household net ownership in both districts was high,
and almost all households (>98 %) owned at least one
mosquito net (i.e., previously owned nets and campaign
nets combined) at endline. This reflects the eligibility cri-
teria that only included households that had received nets
as part of the September 2012 campaign. Households in
the intervention district owned significantly more nets
(average 3.2 nets) at endline than the comparison district
(average 2.7 nets; P = 0.003). At baseline, 72.4 and 77.6 %
of households owned enough nets to cover all its resi-
dents assuming one net for every two people, in the com-
parison and intervention district, respectively. Eighteen
months later, the percent of households with at least one
net for every two people had dropped to 39.2 and 46.0 %,
respectively, translating to a similar percent point drop in
both districts of around 32 %.

Exposure to net care and repair messages

Before the start of the BCC programme, there was no
significant difference between the districts in the per-
cent of respondents who had ever heard any messages
on net care and repair, on average 29.8 %. At endline, a

----$$$$----$$$$----
Helinski et al. Malar J (2015) 14:366

significantly greater percent of respondents had heard
net care and repair messages compared to the baseline in
both districts, yet the increase was much greater in the
intervention district where at endline 81.1 % of respond-
ents had ever heard such messages compared to 49.0 % in
the comparison district (Fig. 2).

Radio was the main medium through which respond-
ents had heard these messages at endline in both dis-
tricts (81.4 %), followed by health workers (Table 1).
Respondents in the intervention district had also heard
messages at religious gatherings due to the tendency
of VHTs to schedule their events around such venues.
Other channels through which the BCC programme
operated, i.e., students, community events, and post-
ers/banners, were another source of information in the
intervention district, albeit at lower recall frequency
(<21 %). The exposure dose, i.e., the number of chan-
nels mentioned by respondents who had heard such
messages, was similar at baseline between districts and
was on average 1.5 channels (P = 0.118). However, at
endline the exposure dose was significantly higher in
the intervention district with 3.2 channels mentioned
per respondent compared to 1.7 for respondents in the
comparison district (P < 0.001). There was no signifi-
cant difference in frequency of messages heard on net
care and repair in both the comparison and intervention
district, and the majority of people (58.0 and 66.5 % in
the comparison and intervention district, respectively)
had heard such messages six or more times in the past
12 months (P = 0.373).

The main message recalled in the intervention district
was to “repair holes early” (Table 1), followed by “handle
the net carefully” This latter message was also recalled
in the comparison district at a high rate. A message spe-
cific to the BCC programme (Silent nights, Happy days:
care, repair, protect) was remembered by one quarter

of respondents in the intervention district, against only
1.1 % of respondents in the comparison district.
Respondents from the intervention district were also
more likely to remember messages around tying up a net
when not in use, inspecting nets for holes, drying nets
in the shade, avoiding bleach for washing, keeping nets
away from fire and reducing the frequency of washing.
Reach of a national LLIN campaign message was similar
between districts, with limited exposure of respondents
to this message (18.1 %). The mean number of messages
recalled was significantly higher in the intervention dis-
trict (4.6 messages) than in the comparison district (3.0
messages; P < 0.001) at endline.

Significantly more families in the intervention district
(83.6 %) reported discussing net care and repair in the
preceding 12 months compared to the comparison dis-
trict (51.1 %; P < 0.001). Additionally, significantly more
children had discussed net care and repair in their fami-
lies in the past 12 months in the intervention (49.7 %)
compared to the comparison district (23.5 %; P < 0.001).

Knowledge about net care

More people in the intervention district (58.5 %) identi-
fied repairing holes as a method to take care of their nets
compared to the comparison district (10.3 %; Table 2). In
addition, respondents in the intervention district men-
tioned more often to protect nets from damage inflicted
by rodents and children. In contrast, more people in
the comparison district mentioned that nets should be
washed less often and with ordinary soap (Table 2).

Significantly more people in the intervention dis-
trict were able to cite various methods to repair a net,
including sewing, tying and patching. In the compari-
son district, more often respondents indicated they did
not know what the recommended way was to repair a
net (16.5 %) compared to only 0.3 % in the intervention
district (Table 2). In addition, repairing holes early was
significantly more often mentioned in the intervention
compared to the comparison district.

The composite attitude index showed that respondents
in the intervention had a more positive attitude, with
31.8 % of respondents classified as having a very positive
attitude towards nets and net care and repair, compared
to 10 % in the comparison district (Table 2). The number
of sources respondents could recall regarding messages
on net care and repair was positively associated with
their attitude in both districts (P < 0.001; Fig. 3). Addi-
tionally, respondents that could recall more messages had
a better attitude in both districts (P < 0.001).

At baseline there was no significant difference in the
average number of times respondents thought a mos-
quito net should be washed each year in both districts,
and the average frequency was 18.4 washes. In the

comparison district there was no change at endline.
However, in the intervention district a significant reduc-
tion was observed at endline compared to baseline figures
(P < 0.001) and respondents indicated that a net should
be washed on average 9.9 times a year. The majority of
people in the intervention district knew that nets should
be washed gently (55.5 %), and with ordinary soap, not
detergent (73.7 %), and this was significantly higher com-
pared to respondents in the comparison district where
34.8 % of respondents knew that nets should be washed
gently and 55.0 % mentioned ordinary soap, not deter-
gent. Respondents in the comparison district, however,
overwhelmingly knew that nets should be washed in a
basin (82.2 %) compared to respondents from the inter-
vention district (33.0 %). Also, in the comparison district,
significantly more people knew that nets should only be
washed when dirty.

Net care and repair behaviours

At baseline, significantly more respondents in the inter-
vention district reported to have ever experienced holes
in any of the nets they owned compared to the compari-
son district (Fig. 4a). Additionally, significantly more
respondents in the intervention district reported to have
ever tried to repair these holes (Fig. 4b). Because of these
inherent differences in reported behaviour and experi-
ence prior to the BCC programme, a difference in differ-
ence (DID) was calculated.

The percent of respondents that had noticed holes
in their nets increased in both districts, and at end-
line 86.0 and 93.6 % of respondents had ever expe-
rienced holes in their nets in the comparison and
intervention districts, respectively, yet the the rate of
increase was significantly greater in the comparison
district compared to the intervention district (Fig. 4a).

Similarly, the percent of respondents that had ever

pared to baseline figures, yet in the comparison dis-
trict a significantly greater increase in percent points
was observed compared to the intervention district
(Fig. 4b).

The main cause of tears/holes in both districts were
reported to be rodents (i.e., significantly more often men-
tioned by respondents in the intervention district (61.1 %)
than in the comparison district (50.2 %; P = 0.030 at end-
line) followed by nets getting caught on edges/nails and
nets that were pulled and tore on corners.

Of the households who reported repairing nets at
endline, the majority of repairs were done using stitch-
ing (68.7 and 86.8 % in the comparison and intervention
district, respectively), followed by knotting or tying. The
majority of repairs were done by the respondents of the
survey, which were mainly the heads of households or
their spouses. Of the households who did not repair nets
at endline, more respondents in the comparison district
indicated they did not know how to repair nets (31.4 %)
compared to 11.2 % of respondents in the intervention
district (P = 0.003). Other common reasons mentioned
for not repairing nets were not enough time for repairs,
materials not available for repairs, and too difficult to
repair.

Campaign nets distribution and attrition

Households received on average 2.4 nets from the cam-
paign in 2012 (Table 3). During baseline it was observed
that the net distribution campaign did not distribute the
same nets in both districts. The comparison district had
received exclusively Olyset nets while in the intervention
district PermaNet was almost exclusively distributed,
alongside a few Olyset nets (ie., 5.5 %). The proportion
of all nets that were campaign nets increased in both dis-
tricts at endline compared to baseline figures, most likely
because older, non-campaign nets had been discarded in
the meantime.

The percent of households that still had all campaign
nets given to them was 82.7 and 86.8 % at endline in
the comparison and intervention district, respectively
(Table 3). Overall attrition was 8.9 % of nets in the com-
parison district, and 6.8 % of nets in the intervention dis-
trict (Table 3) at endline. When only taking into account
those nets lost due to wear and tear, attrition was signifi-
cantly higher in the comparison district, with an attri-
tion rate of 5.4 % compared to 1.7 % in the intervention
district.

Almost half of all nets in the intervention district that
were no longer in the possession of the household were
reported to be lost within the first 3 months after receiv-
ing the nets (48.5 %) while in the comparison district
the majority of nets were lost within 6-12 months after
receiving them (44.9 %). The average age that nets were
lost in the intervention district was thus lower than in
the comparison district (Table 3). At baseline, the large
majority of nets no longer in the possession of the house-
hold were given away to relatives or others (80.8 %),

indicating that these nets were not lost but rather redis-
tributed. At endline this was still the case for the inter-
vention district and 62.6 % of all lost nets had been given
away to others, against only 35.4 % in the comparison
district. In the comparison district, a much larger num-
ber of respondents indicated having thrown away the net
(49.0 %) compared to the intervention district (17.1 %;
P = 0.036). The main reason for no longer keeping the
net in the comparison district was because it was too torn
(53.7 %), while in the intervention district most often
respondents indicated that they had given the net away to
others because they needed it more (45.3 %; P = 0.007).

Campaign nets, location and use

During the endline survey, the majority of campaign nets
in the intervention district were observed to hang loose
over the sleeping place (61.4 %), compared to 49.3 % in
the comparison district (P < 0.001). Although the tying/
rolling up of hanging nets was a key message of the BCC
intervention to prevent net damage, a similar percent of
nets were observed tied in the intervention (26.7 %) com-
pared to the comparison district (27.0 %).

Of all the nets that were reported to be in use (i.e.,
excluding nets never used), more than 94 % of nets at
endline were slept under by a person the previous night,
and no differences were observed between intervention
and comparison district (P = 0.331). The majority of nets
(>91.2 %) were used every night of the week, although
use frequency rates were slightly higher in the interven-
tion district during both surveys (P < 0.01). The main
reason mentioned for not sleeping under a net was that
there were already sufficient nets available in the house-
hold and the net was surplus.

Campaign nets, net care and repair behaviours

Almost all campaign nets had been washed at least once
in both districts at endline (>97 %). The average wash
frequency was similar between districts and was three
washes in the last 3 months, or once a month (P = 0.212).
In both districts bar/liquid soap was used by the large
majority of respondents for net washing (75.7 % in com-
parison and 90 % in intervention district). Importantly,
bleach was never reported to be used to wash the nets.
An increasing number of nets were reported to be dried

in the shade as is appropriate in both districts compared
to baseline figures, yet significantly more respondents
indicated doing this in the intervention district (78.4 %)
than in the comparison district (65.8 %; P < 0.001).

Net durability and survival

Net care and repair behaviour was assessed for the cam-
paign nets that were in use. Analyses were done sepa-
rately by net brand as there were significant differences
in the durability of the two brands observed (P < 0.001).
Since no PermaNets were observed in the comparison
district, only data for the intervention district are pre-
sented for this brand.

At baseline, nets had just been received and few nets
were reported to have had holes, and there were no dif-
ferences between districts in the proportion of nets with
any repairs or in net condition (Table 4). Twenty months
post-distribution, the large majority of nets had at least
one hole. More Olyset nets in the intervention district
were reported to have had a hole compared to nets in the
comparison district. The percent of Olyset nets with evi-
dence of any repair done (i.e., full or partial) was similar
between districts and varied between 48.0 % of nets for
the comparison district and 56.4 % of nets for the inter-
vention district. The average number of repairs done,
either full or partial, per net were greater in the inter-
vention than in the comparison district (Table 4). Net

condition was worse in the intervention district, where
20—21 months after net distribution on average 42.2 %
of Olyset nets in the intervention district had survived in
‘serviceable’ condition, against 55.4 % of nets in the com-
parison district. The PermaNet brand nets were in better
condition, and 74.6 % of nets were considered serviceable
(Table 4).

Net survival, i.e., the proportion of received nets not
given away for use by others that are still present and in
“serviceable” condition for Olyset nets overall was esti-
mated at 55.2 % [95 % CI 48.2—62.3] which was similar to
a two-year median survival curve, while for the PermaNet
sample survival was 74.3 % [95 % CI 68.3-—80.4] and nets
followed closer to a 3 year median survival curve.

Predictors of net condition

A number of factors were assessed to see if they could
predict net outcome using a logistic regression model.
The main analysis was done for PermaNets as these
nets were in significantly better overall condition.
Exposure to net care and repair messages, respond-
ent’s attitude towards net care and repair, and socio-
economic status were all positively associated with a
better net condition (Table 5). Seventy-eight and 80 %
of PermaNets belonging to respondents with a positive
or very positive attitude, respectively were in service-
able condition, compared to only 66 % of nets from

The crude predictors are presented, as well as the final adjusted model

respondents classified as having a poor to average atti-
tude (Fig. 5). Increasing washing frequency was nega-
tively associated with net condition. In addition, nets
that had any signs of repair were in significantly poorer
condition compared to nets that had not been repaired.
Some other predictors, i.e., the presence of children
under the age of five in the household, the number of
messages recalled, sleeping material used, universal
coverage status of the household, and reported pres-
ence of rodents did not have a significant impact on
net condition. After adjusting for other variables, SES,
repair status of the net and attitude were still signifi-
cant in the final adjusted model for PermaNet (Table 5),
with SES and attitude positively associated with net
condition, while net repairs were negatively associated
with net condition.

When a multivariate model was run for Olyset nets,
net repairs were also more commonly seen for nets in
‘too torn’ condition (P < 0.001). Additionally, presence
of rodents was negatively associated with net condition
(P = 0.005), and nets that were used over reed mats or
sleeping spaces on the ground were significantly more
often classified as ‘too torn’ than nets used over bed
frames or foam mattresses (P < 0.003), while nets that
were hanging folded or tied up over a sleeping space were
less often classified as ‘too torn’ compared to nets that
were not (P = 0.019). SES, attitude and washing frequency
were not significant. In this model, net condition was no
longer significantly different between districts (P = 0.060).

Discussion
The main objective of the study was to assess whether the
BCC programme could positively impact on net durabil-
ity. While the BCC programme was successful in reach-
ing a large proportion of households in the intervention
district, results show that durability of Olyset nets was
similar in the intervention and comparison areas at end-
line. However, the uneven distribution of net brands and
overall poor durability of Olyset nets make it difficult to
draw conclusions on whether the lack of impact observed
was due wholly to failure of the BCC programme. Fur-
ther analysis within the intervention district (PermaNets)
showed that the number of channels heard and num-
ber of messages recalled were positively associated with
respondents’ attitude towards net care and repair, and
that, in turn, nets belonging to respondents with a more
positive attitude were in significantly better condition.
However, repairs made to nets did not improve their con-
dition. The findings indicate that BCC may play a role in
improved net condition by improving attitudes towards
care and repair.

The BCC intervention was a multi-channel activity
that used mass media messaging, interpersonal commu-
nication, and school and community events as its main

----$$$$----$$$$----
Helinski et al. Malar J (2015) 14:366

channels. Respondents in the intervention area reported
a significantly increased exposure to net care and repair
messages compared to baseline levels, but this trend was
also observed to a lesser, but still significant degree in the
comparison district. This is likely due to mass media of
the ongoing national LLIN distribution campaign that
was taking place countrywide. Indeed, at least one mes-
sage from the national campaign was remembered by
around one-fifth of respondents in the intervention
and comparison districts, indicating a similar reach in
both districts. In addition, some messaging from the
BCC intervention in the intervention district may have
reached the comparison district. During the design
phase, intervention district representatives specifically
requested that activities take place in Teso and English as
they were the dominant languages in their district. The
addition of English may have made it easier for messages
to reach the comparison district, although a specific slo-
gan from the BCC intervention was only recalled by 1 %
of respondents in the comparison district.

The BCC campaign stressed the importance of han-
dling nets with care, only washing nets when dirty, and
the benefits these actions would give (less malaria, better
sleep, saving money). In addition, substantial emphasis
was placed on the inspection of nets and early repair of
holes. The intervention led to an overall improved knowl-
edge of respondents in the intervention district. In addi-
tion, the attitude of respondents towards net care and
repair was better in the intervention district, although
no baseline levels were available. In both districts, but
to a greater degree in the intervention area, a positive
relationship between the dose, i.e, number of chan-
nels respondents had been exposed to, and attitude was
observed. This dose-response relationship, as observed
in a similar study in Nigeria [18], provides an indication
that a plausible causal relationship between exposure and
attitudes is present.

Better attitudes, in turn, were positively associated
with more PermaNets being in serviceable condition at
endline in the intervention district when controlling for
other factors, and a similar positive effect of attitude on
net condition was found in a similar study performed in
Nigeria [18]. The same was not observed for the Olyset
nets, which were in general in poor condition in both dis-
tricts, and their lifespan, with around half of all surveyed
nets found in too torn condition approximately 2 years
post-distribution, followed a two-year net survival curve
[21]. Poor durability of Olyset nets was observed in
other studies [7, 22—24], and the manufacturer has since
changed the knitting pattern of the product (Nick Brown,
personal communication). Given that the intervention-
area Olysets showed no improvement over Olysets in the
comparison district, it seems likely that while behaviour

Page 12 of 15

change interventions can improve net care and repair
behaviours and improve net condition, there is a limit in
its ability to prevent deterioration when the physical con-
struction of LLINs is suboptimal.

Repair was a large focus in the BCC intervention as
it was hypothesized to have a significant impact on the
pHI. The proportion of nets with observed repairs was
similar between districts, with approximately 50 % of all
nets showing signs of repair, although more repairs per
net were achieved in the intervention district. However,
this increased repair behaviour did not contribute to bet-
ter net condition, and when including other predictors in
the model, there was no significant difference in the per-
cent of nets classified as serviceable for the Olyset brand
between both districts. In fact, repaired nets were in sig-
nificantly worse condition than non-repaired nets for all
brands assessed, which was also observed in the Nigeria
study [18]. This suggests that repairs were not made early
or thoroughly enough to move a net into a less-damaged
pHI category. The findings reported here mirror those
in the Gambia, where an increase in net repairs follow-
ing a BCC intervention was also observed. However, nets
remained badly torn and very few households succeeded
in repairing all of the holes in their net [17]. It is possible
that repairs may have been initiated too late, once the net
condition had already deteriorated so significantly that
it was beyond repair, and additional studies are required
to understand whether early repairs can make a signifi-
cant impact. On the other hand, attitudes towards repair
specifically were an integral component of the overall
attitude score that significantly contributed to improved
net condition. It is reasonable from this data that repair
messages influence overall attitudes, and that therefore,
while repair behaviour is not sufficient to improve net
condition, repair messages still play an important role in
establishing and strengthening the attitudes that improve
the standing of a net in a household to a highly valued
item that should be well-cared for. Qualitative data col-
lected from the area and from another study in Nigeria
identified a number of motivators for net care and repair,
including caring for one’s family, avoiding mosquito bites,
saving money, and maintaining the positive opinion of
others by keeping a clean and intact net [4, 19]. Repair
messages should, therefore, not be ignored when design-
ing BCC activities to improve net integrity.

Looking at the PermaNets in the study, the other fac-
tors that impacted on net condition included socioeco-
nomic status of the household, with wealthier households
having nets in better condition. More frequent washing
(more than three times in the previous 3 months) was
associated with poorer net condition. For Olyset nets it
was observed that nets that were used over reed mats or
for sleeping places located on the ground were less likely

----$$$$----$$$$----
Helinski et al. Malar J (2015) 14:366

to be in serviceable condition than nets observed over
foam mattresses or bed frames, likely due to the fabric
integrity issues of this group of nets. In addition, pres-
ence of rodents negatively impacted on Olyset condi-
tion. Presence of rodents was negatively associated with
net condition in some parts of Nigeria [25]. The different
predictors that were observed for each net brand sug-
gest that factors which may contribute towards a service-
able or too torn net condition are dependent on physical
integrity; weaker nets may be more susceptible to some
factors earlier in their lifespan compared to stronger nets.
A similar study in Nigeria also observed that 100 denier
polyester nets were more likely to be in serviceable condi-
tion in wealthier quintiles, and if the net was tied up dur-
ing the day, but that neither washing frequency, presence
of rodents, nor education level of the head of household
had a significant effect on net condition, in a multivari-
ate regression model [18]. While some of the predictors
observed to influence net condition may be more eas-
ily addressed by household owners themselves, such as
washing frequencies, households are less able to reduce
their rodent populations, or easily improve their bedding
materials. This is particularly the case for the poorest
quintile, whose nets were more likely to be too torn than
were the higher quintiles. Understanding the behavioural
actions that people with a more positive attitude towards
net care and repair take should be investigated further.
Net use was overall high in this survey. Although net
coverage of at least one net for every household remained
high, the majority of households no longer had enough
nets to cover all of its residents 20-21 months post-dis-
tribution. Although the two districts, alongside the other
two that received nets in September 2012, did not receive
any additional nets from the LLIN mass campaign in
2013/2014, results suggest that especially districts that
received Olyset nets require replacing nets in the imme-
diate future through either campaigns or continuous dis-
tribution to achieve high levels of net ownership.
Although the use of this multiple-channel BCC inter-
vention was beneficial in improving attitudes around net
care and repair, more research about the combination of
channels that is most significant would be useful. Such
research should also segment participants by vulnerabil-
ity to net damage. Unlike many HIV and family planning
messages, net care is not sensitive and can be openly dis-
cussed in large fora. For this reason, care messages may be
easily added to radio and news programmes and to large
community events and achieve high reach. However, the
poorest households—who are also more likely to have nets
in poor condition, as well as less educated, less literate, less
likely to access services and also sleeping on mats—are less
likely to be reached by radio, and may benefit from targeted
interpersonal interventions. Community health workers,

who are already tasked with identifying and reaching
the poorest households, can include net care messages
in their work. Instead of having a stand-alone campaign,
programme planners may be able to leverage existing pro-
grammes. Net care messages can be included as part of net
use messaging in other BCC campaigns, community case
management programmes and in continuous net distri-
bution programmes where nets are distributed by health
workers, school teachers or community-based individuals.
Other programmes may also be able to convince educa-
tion officials to incorporate net care and repair into school
curricula. Although this study evaluated a BCC inter-
vention (specifically, a combination of mass media and
community/school activities), other approaches to bring
about change in behaviour, such as community-directed
approaches, core groups/support groups or positive devi-
ance, may also be effective in improving net care behav-
iour. Introducing net care messages may in fact, help make
net use messages feel “fresh” to communities with years of
exposure to net use messaging.

Strengths and limitations

This is one of few studies documenting the impact of
a BCC intervention on household behaviour and net
condition over time. The study was hampered by the
unanticipated uneven distribution of net brands in the
intervention and control districts, and the overall poor
durability of Olyset nets, which complicated the analyses
and interpretation of study findings. Different net brands
were used because the nets for the campaign distribution
in those districts did not arrive in time. As a result, nets
were pulled from the stock that was in country at the time.

There is some indication that the success of the BCC
intervention was limited by its late start, 9 months after
the nets had been distributed. Given the rate of decay it
is likely that nets had already acquired holes and some
might have already been beyond repair during these ini-
tial months. Indeed, nets in the comparison district had
been predominantly lost from household 6-12 months
post-distribution, and the main reason indicated was that
net was too old/torn.

This study rested on the premise that a net in service-
able condition is more protective against malaria. More
research on the relationship between pHI and malaria
prevention is needed to fully understand the contribution
of net care and repair behaviours to malaria prevention.

Conclusions

The evaluation showed that the BCC programme resulted
in improved knowledge and attitudes of respondents,
which impacted positively on net condition. This was
likely the result of overall better care for the nets. Repairs
themselves were not sufficient to improve net condition,

although repair attitudes were a critical component of the
attitudes that positively affected net condition. Additional
research is needed to understand whether early repairs
could improve net condition. As such, BCC messages on
net care and repair should be part of malaria control pro-
grammes and can be integrated in existing services. This
study also provided specific recommendations for such
programmes as it lent insights on channel, audience and
message selection. Due to the range of care behaviours that
can be promoted, additional research on which attitudes
and care behaviours are most associated with improved net
condition would help BCC planners hone their campaigns.
