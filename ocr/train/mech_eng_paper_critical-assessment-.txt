Temperature distribution during any welding process holds the key for understanding and predicting several important welding
attributes like heat affected zone, microstructure of the weld, residual stress, and distortion during welding. The accuracy of the
analytical approaches for modeling temperature distribution during welding has been constrained by oversimplified assumptions
regarding boundary conditions and material properties. In this paper, an attempt has been made to model the temperature
distribution during submerged arc welding process using finite element modeling technique implemented in ANSYS v12. In the
present analysis, heat source is assumed to be double-ellipsoidal with Gaussian volumetric heat generation. Furthermore, variation
of material properties with temperature and both convective and radiant heat loss boundary condition have been considered. The
predicted temperature distribution is then validated against the experimental results obtained by thermal imaging of the welded

plate, and they are found to be in a good agreement.

1. Introduction

Submerged arc welding (SAW) process is a widely used weld-
ing process in the industry for welding of thick plates, partic-
ularly steel. SAW is essentially an automatic or semiautomatic
process with consumable electrode being continuously fed
from a wire electrode roll. The process involves generation
of heat by an arc produced between the consumable wire
electrode and the work piece. The arc so produced is covered
in a mass of fusible granular flux. The flux aids the process
in many ways: it forms a protective coating over the weld,
removes impurities form the weld in the form of slag, shapes
the weld bead, and influences the chemical composition of
the weld and its mechanical properties. Since the arc as well
as the weld pool is covered by a layer of granulated flux,
the loss of heat energy is considerably reduced. This makes
SAW one of the most efficient welding processes with arc
efficiencies reaching as high as 0.84+0.03 [1]. The diameter of
the consumable electrode ranges from 1 to 5 mm. A constant-
potential DC power source, which allows the arc length
control by self-adjusting effect, is generally used with thin
wires (up to 2.4mm). For wires having higher diameter,

constant current DC source is used. However, at very high
welding currents, AC is preferred in order to minimize arc
blow [2]. Owing to the higher heat generation in this process,
high welding speeds up to 5 m/min are attainable. Higher heat
generation and rapid welding considerably reduce distortion
during welding, which occurs due to the expansion and
contraction of the weld adjacent base metal [3].

Analysis of temperature distribution during welding is
important because temperature distribution has a significant
influence on residual stress, distortion, and hence, the fatigue
behavior of weld structure [4]. This problem, a transient heat
transfer type, essentially involves consideration for the type
of heat source, temperature dependent material properties,
effect of latent heat, heat of phase transformation, plate geom-
etry, and convection and surface depression in weld pool, and
convective and radiant heat loss at boundaries [5]. Over the
years, several attempts have been made to solve this problem
by making various assumptions regarding the aforemen-
tioned factors. Rosenthal formulated an analytical solution to
transient temperature field in a semi-infinite body subjected
to an instant point heat source, line heat source, or surface
heat source [6]. Christensen et al’s work showed a good

----$$$$----$$$$----
agreement between Rosenthal's point heat-source based solu-
tion and actual weld bead geometry, under a wide range
of welding conditions and material properties, over several
orders of magnitude. However, the work also reported exper-
imental scatter ranging up to a factor of three [7]. Rykalin
and Nikolaev and Lin stressed on the need to consider
nonconstant thermal properties, heat of phase transforma-
tion, heat input magnitude and distribution, convection and
surface depression in weld pool in transient heat flow model
to improve its accuracy [8, 9]. Grosh and Trabant showed
that the effect of nonconstant thermal properties can only
contribute about 10-15 percent error observed in weld pool
geometry [10]. The effect of latent heat has also been shown
to produce only 5-10 percent error in prediction of weld
geometry [5]. This clearly highlighted the importance of other
factors, besides latent heat and nonconstant thermal proper-
ties, in contributing to the scatter observed in Christensen’
experiments. Investigations into the actual heat intensity dis-
tribution in arcs on a water-cooled copper anode made it pos-
sible to determine the effect of distributed heat source on the
weld geometry [11]. This solution retained all the assumptions
in Rosenthal’s analysis, including absence of convection in
weld pool, variation of material properties, and latent heat of
phase transformation, except the assumption to consider arc
as a point heat source. Rosenthal’s solutions can satisfactorily
predict temperature field only in the region far from the
weld pool. However, solutions considering arc as a distributed
heat source were able to eliminate much of the experimental
deviations in close vicinity of weld pool. Eagar and Tsai mod-
ified Rosenthal’s solution to include a two-dimensional (2-D)
surface Gaussian distributed heat source with a constant dis-
tribution parameter (which can be considered as an effective
solution of arc radius) and found an analytical solution for the
temperature of a semi-infinite body subjected to this moving
heat source [12]. Although the 2-D Gaussian heat distribution
was able to reduce the experimental scatter, it still could not
include weld penetration into the picture. A more generalized
formulation of heat source was much required. Goldak et al.
first introduced a 3-dimensional double ellipsoidal moving
heat source. A finite element analysis was performed using
the double ellipsoidal heat source, and it was found to be
accurate in predicting temperature distribution in welds
having deeper penetration [13]. Subsequently, both analytical
and numerical solutions have been formulated using this
heat source to predict temperature distribution in various
welding processes [14]. However, same assumptions except
about the heat source still applied to the analytical solutions,
thus constraining their accuracy. In this paper, numerical
solution using finite element approach has been applied to
model transient temperature field in SAW process. Unlike the
analytical approach, assumptions regarding constant material
properties, semi-infinite plate geometry, and no heat losses
at boundary have been eliminated for realistic simulation of
transient temperature field in SAW process.

2. Mathematical Modeling of Heat Source

In the initially proposed ellipsoidal heat source, the volu-
metric heat generation is distributed in a Gaussian manner

throughout the welding region. A major problem associated
with this type of heat source is that it tends to provide a less
steep temperature gradient ahead of the arc and steeper gra-
dient behind the arc than what was experimentally observed.
The above problem was solved by a double ellipsoidal heat
source which consists of a combination of two different
semiellipsoidal heat source volumes as shown in Figure 1. The
spread of the front semiellipsoid along the weld direction
is roughly four times the spread of the back semiellipsoid.
A double ellipsoid is specified by four parameters, namely,
ay, a, b, and c. Values of these parameters can be obtained
from the measurement of the weld pool geometry, that is,
weld bead width and weld penetration [14]. Consider the
following:

where Q is the volumetric heat generation at a point, Q, is
net heat input in the process, x, y, and z are the coordinates
measured from starting point of the welding process; v and
t are welding speed and time elapsed, respectively, f, and
f, are proportion coefficients representing heat appointment
in front and back of the heat source. Their values can be
found by equating the heat generated from the front and rear
semiellipsoid at their interface in the middle. Consider the
following:

3. Finite Element Modeling

3.1. Material Properties. As mentioned earlier, the analytical
method to model temperature distribution during welding
assumes the material properties to be constant. However,
in the present analysis, the variation of material properties
as well as the effect of phase transformation and weld
pool convection is given due consideration. The material
properties required in the preprocessing step of finite element
analysis are density, thermal conductivity, and specific heat
capacity of steel. It is dificult to obtain accurate tempera-
ture dependent material properties data from the literature.
Hence, a basic assumption that the material property does
not vary much with only a slight variation in composition
of the material has been made while obtaining the material
properties data. The density of low carbon steel or struc-
tural steel is taken as 7850kg/m’*, and it is assumed to
remain constant throughout the process. The same, how-
ever, cannot be said about conductivity and specific heat
capacity.

3.1.1. Conductivity. Conductivity of low carbon steel varies
considerably with temperature. Thermal conductivity of low
carbon steel is about 53 W/mK at room temperature and
shows an almost linear reduction with temperature to a value
of 27 W/mK at approximately 800°C [15].

Weld pool convection increases the heat transfer in the
molten weld pool due to its stirring effect. Since the exper-
imental measurement as well as the simulation of the weld
pool convection is an extremely complex task, the effect of
weld pool convection is approximated by increasing the con-
ductivity of the metal beyond the liquidus temperature by a
multiple, which is usually between eight and ten [16]. Goldak
et al. (1984) suggested the use of a fictitious value of thermal
conductivity of 120 W/mK to account for the enhancement in
heat transfer in the liquid zone due to weld pool convection
[13]. In this paper, same approach as that of Goldak et
al. (1984) has been adopted, and the thermal conductivity
of low carbon steel has been artificially set to 120 W/mK
in the liquidus region. Figure 2 shows the variation of the
conductivity with consideration of weld pool convection.

3.1.2. Specific Heat. Specific heat is defined as heat energy
absorbed by a unit mass of a material to raise its temperature
by 1K. Like conductivity, specific heat of low carbon steel also
varies with temperature. Latent heat of phase transformation
also affects the specific heat of the material near the vicinity of
phase transformation. The first phase transformation in low
carbon steel occurs as ferritic structure changes to austenitic
crystalline structure at about 723°C. This increases the
specific heat capacity at phase transformation temperature
(723°C). Consider the following:

The above variation (Eurocode 3-EN 1993-1-2 (2005) speci-
fications [17]) is not feasible to be used directly in the FEA
model as it will make the system highly nonlinear and will
increase the processing time tremendously. A compromise
was made by taking a linear approximation of the graph
segments to prevent the model from becoming unwieldy.

Another phase transformation occurs at solidus-liquidus
phase change, which has a latent heat of about 260 KJ/Kg.
However, some researchers suggest that latent heat of fusion
has insignificant effect on temperature distribution [18].
Nonetheless, in this paper, the effect of latent heat of fusion
has been considered. The release of latent heat has been
assumed to be uniformly distributed between the solidus
and the liquidus temperatures. The effect of latent heat can
be incorporated in the model by artificially increasing the
specific heat capacity of low carbon steel in the solid-liquid

phase transformation region [19]. The overall variation of
specific heat with temperature is shown in Figure 3.

3.2. Boundary Condition. Heat losses in the welding process
take place by both convection and radiation. The radiation
heat loss being proportional to the fourth power of tempera-
ture becomes prominent only at higher temperature, which is
encountered in the close vicinity of the weld pool. As opposed
to the radiation heat loss, convective heat loss becomes a
primary mechanism of heat loss at low temperature region
away from the weld line. Some researchers prefer using a
single heat loss equation to model both processes proposed
by Vinokurov (7) [20, 21].

This equation was, however, reported inaccurate by Goldak
as compared to applying Newton's law of cooling and Stefan
Boltzmann law of radiation separately. Therefore, in this
analysis, the radiant heat loss and the convective heat loss
have been applied separately.

In submerged arc welding process, the granular flux cov-
ers the weld region completely thereby providing insulation
to it. This results in a more gradual decrease in temperature of
the welded zone. Since the flux covers the maximum part of
the plate (20 cm x 20 cm x 1.5 cm) used in the experiment, the
top face of the plates has been assumed to be insulated; that is,
convection and radiation heat losses are ignored in the upper
face of the plate. This assumption is valid only for submerged
arc welding process and distinguishes it from other welding
processes which use an inert gas for shielding the arc like TIG
and MIG.

3.3. Meshing and Time-Stepping. A finite element model of
the submerged arc welding process was created using ANSYS
vl2.0. The accuracy of a model depends upon its element
size or number of nodes and time step size. The increase
in number of nodes not only increases the accuracy of the
model, but it also increases the processing time of the model.

Advances in Materials Science and Engineering

of interest on the welded plate.

An optimum solution could be reached by increasing node
density near the region of high temperature gradient, which
is in the vicinity of weld line, and decreasing node density
near the region of low temperature gradient, which is away
from the weld line. Also, automatic time stepping, which aims
at reducing the processing time of the solution especially of
nonlinear and transient dynamic problems by automatically
estimating the next time step based on the present state of the
system and the previous processing step, has been applied.

4. Experimental Procedure

For validation of numerical solution, temperature variation,
both temporal and spatial, has to be determined experi-
mentally. In the present work, infrared thermography has
been used to determine the temperature profile of the plate
at various time steps, thereby capturing both temporal and
spatial variation of temperature. In submerged arc welding
process, the molten weld metal is covered by an envelope of
molten flux and a layer of unfused flux [22]. The granular
flux provides insulation to the weld and makes the thermal
imaging of the region infeasible. Even the sides of the weld
are covered by stray flux particles, thus interfering with
the measurement of temperature by IR camera [23]. This
necessitates the use of a method to remove this flux, thereby
eliminating any interference in thermal imaging, for example,
a vacuum flux remover provided just behind the welding
torch head [23]. In the present work, a (13cm x 5 cm) piece
of sheet metal was bent in a U-shape having a gap of about
1 cm between the two arms. A layer of insulation was provided
at the bottom of the U-shaped sheet metal to minimize the
heat transfer coefficient at the bottom. This U-shaped sheet
metal with closed end facing the weld line was inserted into
the flux covered region at the middle of the weld line from
the side as shown in Figure 4. The U-piece cleared the flux
from that zone and provided a window (region of interest
(ROI)) to measure the temperature profile of the region
without much altering the profile itself. This was because
the uncovered region was much smaller as compared to the
covered region; therefore, the convection and radiation heat
loss from the uncovered region could not much affect the
temperature profile of the plate. Also, the negligible area of

performed on MEMCO semiautomatic welding equipment

Auto melt Gr II AWS/SFA 5.17 Granular, and the electrode
used was ADOR 3.15 diameter copper coated wire. The
203 welding parameters were noted during the actual welding
process for any fluctuations. The U-shaped sheet metal was
inserted at the middle as shown in Figure 4, and thermal
images of the region of interest (ROI) were taken using an
IR camera (RayCam C.A. 1888) at a regular interval of 10 sec
134 from 55 sec to 265 sec. The welded plate was then allowed to
cool, flux was removed using a chipping hammer, and width
and penetration of the weld bead were measured (see Table 1).

addition to the insulation provided at the bottom of U-piece
ensured minimum heat transfer to the sheet metal, while it
was in contact with the weld plate.

A structural steel plate of dimension (200 mm x 200 mm
x 15mm) was cut into two equal parts. A V-groove of 60°

vl2.0, and temperature at specific instances of time was
extracted for the whole plate. To determine the temperature
in the region of interest (ROI) from the FEA model, the
temperature was mapped along the path defined by the line
perpendicular to the weld line on the upper face of the plate
and intersecting it at its middle. The pseudocolor thermal
image of ROI was converted to gray-scale image, and the
intensity value along the middle line was extracted by using
Matlab code.

These values were then scaled to give the actual temper-
ature profile along the contour. The predicted temperature

modeling of the material properties and the boundary heat
loss condition. Particularly, the assumption that no heat loss
due to convection or radiation occurs on the upper face,
which is largely covered by stray flux particles, compromises
the accuracy of the model in the outer region and at a later
time as the outer bare region of the upper face gets heated
enough to make the heat loss significant. The aforementioned
factor can be noticed in Figures 12-14, where increased error
in the region farther from weld line can be seen.

It can be observed from Figure 15 that the temperature
gradient is much higher in front of the arc than at its back.
Therefore, the weld region in front of the arc plays no role
in heat transfer until the arc reaches there. This observation
justifies the assumption of ignoring the addition of mass of
the filler electrode by birth and death of the element in FEM.

The dissipation of heat in the plate can be clearly dis-

of stray flux particles in obstructing the view of IR Camera
is also patent from the thermograms. Moreover, Figure 16
clearly shows the extent to which the stray flux particles
shield the upper surface of the plate, thereby supporting our
assumption of ignoring the heat losses from the upper face.

flux. This makes it infeasible to observe the temperature
profile directly using either infrared thermometer or camera.
Thermocouple could provide information regarding tem-
perature at a point, but due to practical difficulties, like
their interaction with the measurement, they cannot be used
in sufficiently large numbers to provide spatial resolution
necessary to capture temperature pattern reliably and accu-
rately [5]. Though the experimental methodology followed
in this paper allows measurement of temperature close to
weld line, it still does not completely solve the problem
of direct observation of the weld pool, thereby failing to
analyze the performance of the FEA model closer to the
weld pool. Nevertheless, the present work has validated the
accuracy of FEA modeling in prediction of temperature
profile sufficiently close to the weld region.

Once the credibility of FEA has been established, it opens
the door to modeling and understanding a number of other
properties associated with welding. The heat affected zone
(HAZ) can be predicted by plotting all the points whose
maximum temperature reaches more than recrystallization
temperature 973 K but less than melting point temperature
(1683 K) [4]. The temperature profile obtained from the tran-
sient thermal FE analysis can be used as an input loading con-
dition for uncoupled structural analysis, which assumes that
structural loads act independently of thermal loads. Similarly,
the knowledge of temperature history of the plate can shed a
significant insight on the microstructure of the weld region.
