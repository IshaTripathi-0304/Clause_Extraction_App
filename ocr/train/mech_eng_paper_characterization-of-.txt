Abstract

In this paper, an experimental vapour compression cycle (VCC) prototype is developed. The VCC system
composes of a high performance 300W linear compressor with variable capacity control, expansion
valve, air-cooled condenser, and two microchannel plate heat exchangers acting as evaporator and
recuperator. Wide range of experimental characterization is performed to investigate the influence of
changing the compressor capacity, evaporating temperature and expansion valve opening position on the
VCC performance. The prototype unit is able to achieve a high coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.5.
Component and refrigeration cycle models are developed and validated with the experimental data. The
proposed cycle model provides the insight to guide energy-efficient compact cooling system design and
operation.

1. Introduction

Vapor compression cycles (VCC) are widely used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems, which
are considered as one of the most energy-consuming domestic appliances. Refrigerators and air
conditioning systems represent 13.7% and 16% respectively of all residential electricity consumption in
USA for 2001 [1]. Also, air conditioning systems consume up to 70% of the UAE total energy
consumption [2]. Hence, better designs of cooling systems are required to minimize the energy
consumption. The trend in electronic industry is towards more compact systems. These systems required
more effective cooling as they produce a lot of heat. Therefore, compact vapor compression cycles are
sought for portable high-end electronic systems. A study has been done by Trutassanawin et al. [3] to
develop a compact refrigeration system prototype to demonstrate its feasibility in electronic cooling

applications. The system cooling capacity varied from 121 to 268 W, with a COP of 2.8 to 4.7, and with a
second-law efficiency ranging from 33% and 52%. A test-bed has been developed by Chang et al. [4] to
examine the thermal performance of a miniature VCC for electronic cooling purposes. The effect of the
compressor speed and the expansion valve opening on the COP of the cycle has been studied. The study
concluded that the condensation phenomena were improved when the compressor speed was reduced
from 4200 to 3840 RPM.

A detailed study of a VCC test-bed has been carried out by Arora and Kaushik [5] to analyze the cycle
COP and exergetic efficiency for different refrigerant, where experiment were performed with evaporator
and condenser temperature range from -50 °C to 0 °C and 40 °C to 55 °C respectively. This study
concluded that when the evaporator temperature increases, the pressure ratio across the compressor
decreases which lead to a lower compression work and then a higher COP. In order to enhance the COP
of the refrigeration systems, the flow within the evaporator should remain in two phase region. Heat
transfer coefficient deteriorated in superheated zone. Therefore, two phase flow is preferable to achieve
higher heat transfer coefficient [6]. An analysis has been conducted by Torrella et al. [7] described a
general methodology for analyzing six possible configuration of VCC. They found that configuration with
higher subcooling degree has higher COP, due to the fact that the degree of subcooling increases the
difference in specific enthalpy across the evaporator. The study by Jensen and Skogestad [8] focused on
the optimal operation for a simple VCC. It discussed the effect of having sub-cooling and super-heating
degrees on the compressor power consumption. The study found that super-heating degree should be
minimized whereas some sub-cooling is optimal. The work in Aprea et al. [9] discussed the advantages of
using suction-liquid heat exchanger on the performance of refrigeration systems from a thermodynamic
point of view. It showed the influence of using the recuperator on the COP enhancement by adding some
sub-cooled and super-heated degrees on the refrigerant.

In the above studies, there are limited discussions on developing recuperator-based VCCs with linear
compressors. Linear compressor has the inherent advantage for refrigeration applications since it can be
easily controlled to provide variable refrigeration cooling capacities upon demand. This work highlights
the effect of installing a fluid-to-fluid recuperator on the system COP. Wide range of parametric studies
are performed to analyze the influence of changing component operating conditions on the system
performance. Additionally, components and cycle level characterizations are developed to predict the
cycle performance at different operation conditions. This study contributes to the development of energy-
efficient compact vapor compression cycle. It also shows the potential of the compact VCC systems for
portable cooling applications such as electronics cooling.

2. Experimental Test-bed

The basic VCC consists of compressor, condenser, evaporator and expansion device. For better heat
transfer in the evaporator an accumulator is usually added after the evaporator so the evaporator exit is
maintained in the two-phase flow region [6]. In addition, an internal heat exchanger can be added to
utilize the temperature difference in the loop by exchanging the heat between the condenser and
evaporator exits.

Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram and photo of the VCC prototype we have developed. All the
sensors are connected to data acquisition systems. The accuracy of the temperature, pressure, and mass
flow rate are +0.7 °C, +0.15% of full scale, and +0.08% of measurement respectively. The data are
recorded into a computer station using LabVIEW software. More details may be found in [10]. All
components are assembled on an aluminum frame and connected using copper pipe and brass fittings as
shown in Figure 1(b). Once the loop is assembled, it is tested for leakage, insulated and charged with
R134a refrigerant.

3. Experimental Characterization

The controllable parameters in the VCC are the compressor capacity, heat source temperature, and
expansion valve opening position. Changing these parameters result in different compressor and
evaporator energy input, recuperator heat exchange rate and condenser heat rejection rate. The
compressor capacity has been changed from 50-100% with 10% step and the expansion valve opening
position has been changed from open number 4 into open number 6.

Figure 2-a shows the effect of changing the compressor capacity on the coefficient of performance
(COP) of the cycle at different expansion valve opening positions. With increasing the compressor
capacity, the length of the piston stroke in the compressor increases which leads to a higher power
consumption as shown in Figure 2-d. The increase of the piston stroke length means more refrigerant
mass flow rate which increases the evaporator cooling capacity as shown in Figure 2-b. However, the
increase in the power consumption is higher than the increase in the evaporator cooling capacity.
Therefore, the cycle COP decreases as compressor capacity increases. Figure 2-c shows the effect of
changing the compressor capacity at the pressure ratio across the compressor. With increasing the
compressor capacity, the compressor outlet pressure increases [11] which lead to a higher pressure ratio
across the compressor at fix valve opening position.

4. VCC Modeling

4.1. Plate Heat Exchanger (Evaporator and Recuperator) and Fin-Tube Air-Cooled Heat Exchanger
(Condenser)

In the evaporator, the refrigerant gains heat from heat source fluid. The refrigerant enters and exits the
evaporator as a two-phase fluid. Therefore, the evaporator has only one flow zone as shown in Figure 3-a.
In order to model the heat transfer in the evaporator, heat balance between the refrigerant, plate's wall,
and oil should be solved to predict the evaporator outlet condition as below:

[evap (Tsat ~~ Tw )Pwhp| = [ou (Toin ~ Tw)Pwh|,, + [(anctAs + mD),}) (Tamb ~ Tw lamp (1)

evap

The recuperator transfers the heat from refrigerant at the condenser outlet into refrigerant at the
evaporator outlet due to the temperature difference between these two points. In the condenser side,
refrigerant enters the recuperator as a two-phase fluid and exits as a sub-cooled liquid. On the other side,
the refrigerant exits the evaporator and enters recuperator as a two-phase fluid and exits as super-heated
gas. Since, the scenario of the interaction between these two fluids are unknown, an assumption of
dividing the recuperator into three flow zones has been made as shown in Figure 3-b. In order to model
the heat transfer in the recuperator, heat balance heat balance equations between condenser-refrigerant,
heat exchanger wall, and evaporator-refrigerant should be solved for each zone:

[@evapppll (Tw — Tsat) | yap = |cona Lt (Teona, _ Ty)]
[Qevappph2(Tw ~~ Tsat) | yap = [@conapp 2 (Tsat ~ Tw) ona (2)

| evap, L3 (Ty ~~ Tevap, )| = [@conappL3 (Tsat ~ Ty)|

evap cond
In order to predict the outlet condition of the condenser, heat balances between refrigerant, pipe wall,

and air flow across the condenser should be solved for each zone. The flow inside the condenser is
divided into two main regions as shown in Figure 3-c.

4.2. Linear Compressor and Expansion Valve

The compressor used in this work is a piston-cylinder compressor type that uses a linear motor to
drive the piston. The governing equation to model the compressor is, m = pVwyn,, where p is the density,
V is the compression volume, w is the frequency, and 7, is the volumetric efficiency and it is a function
of the pressure ratio across the compressor.

Mass flow rate across the expansion valve is governed as, m = C,,/ Pin (Pin — Pour), Where C, is the
flow coefficient of the valve and it is a function of the cross sectional area, the fluid specifications and
pressure ratio.

5. Model Validation

All component models have been validated with experimental data to predict inlet and outlet
conditions of each component. Figure 4-a shows the effect of changing the compressor capacity on
recuperator different zones lengths. With increasing compressor capacity heat transfer in the recuperator
also increases due to higher temperature difference across recuperator plates. Therefore, refrigerants will
gain more super-heated and sub-cooled degrees at higher compressor capacity which affects recuperator
two-phase zone. Figure 4-b shows the P-h diagram for the VCC test-bed at different compressor
capacities. The graph shows a very good agreement between the experimental data and the component
model predictions.

The cycle model should be self-contained and the model predictions just depend on external boundary
conditions: Air velocity and ambient temperature at the condenser side and oil mass flow rate and inlet
temperature at the evaporator side. Component models developed in the previous sections are combined
and integrated together into the cycle model. Figure 5 shows the cycle model validation at evaporating
temperature 25 °C and compressor capacity 100%. Additionally, the cycle model was able to predict the
refrigerant mass flow rate with a maximum prediction error of 9.27%. All graphs and results show very
good agreements between cycle model and experimental data.

6. Conclusion and Future Work

A compact VCC prototype was designed and developed. Extensive parametric studies were carried
out to better understand system characteristics under changing operating conditions. Moving boundary
models were developed for recuperator and condenser to find out the effect of changing the operating
condition on these heat exchangers performance. The recuperator model was able to predict the amount
of super-heat and sub-cooled degrees added to the refrigerant at different operating points. The model is
coupled with other component models and integrated into a cycle-level model. The proposed components
and cycle models were validated with experimental results. Components and cycle model predictions
agree well with experimental data.
