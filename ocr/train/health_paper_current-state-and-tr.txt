Ethiopia and the need to revise indicators to
monitor progress in the Post-2015 era

Abstract

Background: Investigating the current level and trends of access and identifying the underlying challenges to
sanitation system development will be useful in determining directions developing countries are heading as they
plan to promote sustainable development goals (post 2015 agenda). This research investigates the status and
trends of access to improved sanitation coverage (ISC) in relation to the MDG target in Ethiopia with the aim of
identifying prevailing constraints and suggesting the way forward in the post-MDG era.

Method: We examined data from a nationwide inventory conducted in accordance with the sanitation ladder at
the national level and from a household survey in randomly selected urban slums in Addis Ababa. The inventory
data were analyzed and interpreted using the conceptual model of the sanitation ladder. We used administrative
reports and survey results to plot the time trend of the ISC.

Results: The data from the nationwide inventory of sanitation facilities, which are presented along the sanitation
ladder reveal that more than half of the Ethiopian population (52.1%) still used unimproved sanitation facilities in

2014. The majority (35.6%) practiced open defecation, implying that the country is far from the MDG target for
access to improved sanitation (56%). Most people in urban slums (88.6%) used unimproved sanitation facilities,
indicating that the urban poor did not receive adequate sanitation services. Trend analysis shows that access
to ISC has increased, but Central Statistical Authority (CSA) data reveal a decline. This discrepancy is due to
differences in data collection methods and tools. Dry pit latrines are the most widely used toilet facilities in
Ethiopia, accounting for about 97.5% of the ISC.

Conclusion: The sanitation coverage is far from the MDG target and the majority of the population, mainly the
urban poor, are living in a polluted environment, exposed to water and sanitation-related diseases. The sanitation
coverage estimates might be even lower if proper utilization, regular emptying, and fecal sludge management (FSM) of
dry pit latrines were considered as indicators. In order to enhance sanitation services for all in the post-MDG era, urgent
action is required that will establish proper monitoring and evaluation systems that can measure real access to ISC.

Background

Lack of access to sanitation, use of unsafe drinking water,
and poor hygiene together are responsible for about 88%
of all deaths from diarrheal diseases in developing
countries [1]. Sanitation and health experts are also
estimated that improved sanitation alone could reduce
by one third the global incidence of diarrheal disease,
a leading killer of children [2], and can also play a
major role in reducing parasitic infections that impede
child development. Cognizant of the crucial role of water,
sanitation, and hygiene in health development, the United
Nations (UN), in Resolution 64/292, explicitly recognizes
the human right to water and sanitation [3]. This reso-
lution declares that safe drinking water and sanitation are
essential to the realization of all human rights and calls
upon states and organizations to support developing
countries in the provision of safe, adequate, and accessible
drinking water and sanitation for all. In support of this
UN resolution, the World Health Organization (WHO),
in Resolution 64/24, urges member states to ensure that
national health strategies contribute to the realization of
water- and sanitation-related Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) [4].

An improved sanitation facility is commonly defined
as one that hygienically separates human excreta from
human contact [5]. According to the Joint Monitoring
Program for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) [5],
improved sanitation coverage (ISC) is measured as the
proportion of a population using an improved sanitation
facility. Private improved pit latrines (PIPL), private
traditional pit latrines (PTPL) with slab and super
structure, composting toilets, and flush or pour-flush
toilets connected to sewer systems and septic tanks
are considered improved sanitation (IS); improved
shared latrines (ISL), unsanitary toilets (USTs) such as
flush or pour-flush toilets that discharge their contents
into the environment, pit latrines without super structure,
open pit, bucket, hanging toilets, and open defecation
(OD) are considered unimproved sanitation (UIS).

Globally, remarkable achievements have been made in
the provision of sanitation, with over 64% of the world’s
population reportedly having access to improved sanitation
in 2013 [6]. In 2014, the WHO and UNICEF JMP reported
that 116 countries met the MDG target for drinking water
whereas only 64 countries met the target for sanitation.
Thirty-seven of the 69 countries not on track to meet the
MDG sanitation target were in Sub-Saharan Africa [6].

According to the JMP and the Central Statistical
Authority of Ethiopia (CSA) reports, Ethiopia is one
of the Sub-Saharan African countries not on track to meet
the MDG sanitation target [6,7], although the national re-
port of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development
[8] claims that Ethiopia is on track to meet this MDG tar-
get. The discrepancy between these reports may impair

Page 2 of 8

progress in improved sanitation coverage because overes-
timated coverage can result in a false sense of achieve-
ment. The rapidly increasing demand for sanitation [9]
and the deteriorating rate of access to improved sanitation
in Sub-Saharan Africa [10,11], where Ethiopia is a case in
point, call for detailed research. Identifying current levels
and trends of access and identifying the driving factors
will become increasingly important as populations grow
larger and struggle to obtain basic services. Therefore, one
major objective of this study is to assess the status, trends,
and reporting of sanitation in Ethiopia.

In 2010, only 40% of the global population (2.8 billion
people) used improved sanitation as estimated by
Baum et al. [12]; this figure is little over half the JMP
estimate (4.3 billion people) for that year [5]. Baum et al.
[12] also estimated that 4.1 billion people globally lacked
access to improved sanitation facilities. The discrepancy is
due to the inclusion of unimproved sanitation, such as
toilet facilities connected to sewer systems without
adequate sewage treatment, in the improved sanitation
category in the JMP report [12]. Some studies report that
sanitation coverage is overestimated due to the use of
wrong indicators for improved sanitation [13] and because
of over reporting [14]. Monitoring progress in sanitation
access has mainly focused on household-level inventories
of type and number of toilet facilities, ignoring proper
utilization and user behavior [15]. Evaluation of access to
improved sanitation should consider the complete fecal
sludge management (FSM) chain from containment to
adequate treatment, including waste valorization for sus-
tainable sanitation systems. In this regard, detailed studies
are required to identify the limitations of the monitoring
system and the use of indicators to comprehensively
assess sanitation services in relation to their suitability for
pollution control and minimizing public health risks. The
second objective of this research is therefore to investigate
methods and tools useful in increasing accessibility to
improved sanitation in Ethiopia, particularly indicators
used to monitor progress towards greater access.

Methods

Review of reports

The JMP of WHO and UNICEF reports on progress in im-
proved sanitation coverage (ISC) at http://www.wssinfo.org/
documents/. We accessed and collected the data points of
the JMP reports from this online source for 1990-2014. We
also compiled data on ISC trends from administrative
government reports (AGRs) of the Ethiopian Ministry
of Health (MoH) that are available in its annual Health and
Health Related Indicators reports as well as the Ethiopian
Demographic Health Survey (DHS) data for 1990-2014.
The time trends in these MoH reports were plotted using
line charts without smoothing technique to show the
real variability within the reports. We critically appraised

sanitation survey methods (access and actual use) and use
of indicators as well as the system and chain of reporting
within the government structure.

National sanitation inventory

A cross-sectional study design was used in all the surveys.
The sanitation ladder used by the JMP [16] is a useful tool
for monitoring progress towards MDG 7. In 2014, The
Ethiopian Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Energy
conducted a nationwide inventory of sanitation facilities in
accordance with the sanitation ladder. The inventory was
carried out in all urban and rural households nationwide by
trained data collectors using an observational checklist and
predefined lists of improved and unimproved sanitation
facilities [5]. The national representative inventory data were
compiled and analyzed to assess the 2014 level of improved
sanitation coverage in relation to the MDG target.

Household survey

To investigate the status of ISC in the poor segment of
the population, our study team also conducted a 2014
inventory of sanitation facilities in accordance with the
sanitation ladder; the study was conducted in 403
randomly selected households in urban slums in
Addis Ababa. The sample size was estimated using the
maximum sample size formula. A multistage sampling
technique was used to randomly select five subcities from
among Addis Ababa’s 10 subcities, 2 districts from each
subcity, and 40 households from each district. Only
households with per capita income of less than 1.25 US$
per day were included. We briefly explained the purpose
of the interview to the respondents and obtained verbal
consent at the beginning of each household interview
and direct observation of sanitation facilities, giving
households the option of declining to participate without
repercussions. One adult household member was inter-
viewed in each selected household. Householders absent
at the time of the interviews or who refused to be inter-
viewed were deleted from the list and replaced with the
nearest household. All surveys were based on households,
but access to improved sanitation was expressed in
percent of the population by multiplying the number
of households by average family size.

Data quality was ensured by training data collectors
(environmental health professionals), maintaining strict
supervision of research team members, using a standard
checklist during direct observation, and practicing double
data entry. The questionnaires were translated into the
local language and pretested outside the study area.

Analysis

Inventory results were analyzed and interpreted using the
conceptual model of the sanitation ladder (Figures 1 and 2)
adapted from WHO and UNICEF [16]. The adapted

Page 3 of 8

sanitation ladder shows sanitation data for Addis
Ababa along two axes. The first axis represents the ladders
of sanitation technologies from open defecation (OD) to
flush toilets (FT) connected to a sewer system or septic
tank. The second axis represents the promotion of public
health toward access and utilization of improved sanita-
tion facilities that can be measured in terms of the reduc-
tion in incidence and prevalence of sanitation-related
diseases [16]. Results of this semi-quantitative study were
presented in tables and graphs.

Ethics

The national sanitation inventory was not subjected to
ethical review since it is an operational study without
involving human subjects. Nevertheless, the protocols
for the household survey were reviewed by the Ethical
Review Board of the College of Health Sciences, Jimma
University, Ethiopia and we received an ethical approval
before conducting the survey.

Results
Current status of sanitation coverage in relation to the
sanitation ladder
We summarized the 2014 sanitation coverage status in
Addis Ababa and Ethiopia along the sanitation ladder in
Table 1. Only 11.4% of Addis Ababa’s population in the
urban slums and 41.2% of the city’s total population had
access to improved sanitation. Most people in the urban
slums (80.4%) used unimproved sanitation facilities and
8.2% practiced open defecation. Better sanitation and
toilet coverage in the urban area of Addis Ababa than in
the Addis Ababa slums and national urban areas was indi-
cated by the lower open defecation rate and the generally
higher improved sanitation rates in the former (Table 1).
According to the 2014 JMP report, 73% of Ethiopia’s urban
and 77% of its rural population used unimproved sanitation
facilities, with 8% in urban and 43% in rural communities
practicing open defecation (Figure 1). The Ethiopian DHS
survey in 2014 estimated that 82.5% of the urban and
97.5% of the rural population had no access to improved
sanitation and that 8.7% of urban and 37.5% of the rural
population practiced open defecation (Figure 1). The use of
shared latrines was less common in rural than in urban
areas; however, the accessibility rates for unsanitary toilets
(USTs) were similar in urban and rural areas (Figure 1).
Extrapolation and comparison of the data of the
nationwide inventory of sanitation facilities using the
conceptual model of the sanitation ladder shows that
52.1% of Ethiopia’s population use unimproved sanitation
facilities and 47.9% have access to improved sanitation
facilities. Dry pit latrines (improved pit latrines and
pit latrines) are the most common and widely used toilet
facilities in Ethiopia (Table 1 and Figure 2). Unsanitary
toilets (USTs) such as bucket toilets, open pit toilets, and

night soil were considered as open defecation in the
national inventory and hence were not included in
Figure 2. Of the 52.1% using unimproved sanitation
facilities, 35.6% practice open defecation (Figure 2),
indicating that Ethiopia is far from the MDG target
(56%) for access to ISC.

Trends of improved sanitation coverage

A steeper increase of ISC was observed in the AGR than
the JMP report on both national (Figure 3a) and urban
(Figure 3b) scales. Despite a few discrepancies, sanitation
coverage had increased between 1990 and 2012 in both
urban areas and nationwide. According to the AGR, ISC
increased from 13% in 1997 to 84.1% in 2012 at the
national level (Figure 3a), whereas the JMP reported
an increase from 4% in 1990 to 24% in 2012 at the
national level. The 2014 national level inventory revealed
the status of ISC to be 47.9%, which is approximately half
way above and half way below the levels reported by the

JMP and AGRs, respectively. Similarly, the AGRs showed
that ISC increased from 55.0% in 1997 to 83.9% in 2012,
whereas JMP reports indicated that ISC increased from
14% in 1990 to 27% in 2012 among urban residents. In
contrast to the JMP report, the AGR stated that Ethiopia
met the MDG target for access to improved sanitation in
2009. The inventory results estimated that the 2014 status
of ISC for urban Ethiopia was lower than 75%. As shown in
Figure 3, higher inter-annual variability in the ISC pattern
was observed in the AGRs than in the JMP reports.

In contrast to the AGRs and JMP reports, the results of
the national surveys that were conducted by the Ethiopian
Statistical Authority in collaboration with international
consultants (ORC Macro and CFI International) revealed
a declining trend of ISC. For instance, in urban areas,
ISC declined from 23.6% in 2005 to 18.2% and 17.5%
in 2011 and 2014, respectively (Figure 4) and in rural
areas from 6.8% in 2005 to 5.4% in 2011. A two-fold
decline in coverage was observed in 2014 at both the

Discussion

Current status of sanitation coverage in relation to the
sanitation ladder

The importance of sanitation in safeguarding human
health is well known and undisputed. We used the sanita-
tion ladder to analyze the 2014 inventory of sanitation
technologies for Ethiopia. This analysis shows that 52.1%
of the Ethiopian population still use unimproved sanitation
facilities; most practice open defecation. These data
indicate that the country is far from the MDG target.
The AGRs show that Ethiopia met the interim 2009
MDG target for access to improved sanitation with
coverage of 84.1%. The Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development (MoFED) reports agree with the AGR,
saying that Ethiopia is on track to meet the MDG and
showing that the national sanitation coverage increased
from 63% in 2010 to 67% in 2012 [8]. Nevertheless,
Ethiopian-MoFED stressed in its report that realities on
the ground suggest that the country needs to do a lot
more to increase access to improved sanitation. In

contrast to both the AGR and MoFED reports, the
Ethiopian CSA national survey, JMP reports, and the
national inventory results confirm that the current state of
sanitation is far from the MDG target. Bostoen and Evans
[13] pointed out that reports of sanitation coverage for the
MDG in most developing countries are unreliable and
tend to present an unrealistic sense of achievement. This
fact implies that there is a need to improve monitoring
tools and the reporting system to minimize discrepancies
and facilitate program planning and evaluation.

Due to rapid urbanization and the correspondingly
increasing demand for basic sanitation, the claim that
urban sanitation in Sub-Saharan Africa has been
steadily improving in recent decades is doubtful [17].
Our comparison of the sanitation coverage survey in
the urban slums of Addis Ababa with the nationwide
sanitation inventory reveals that only 11.4% of urban
slum residents have access to improved sanitation.
This level of coverage is far lower than the improved
sanitation coverage throughout Addis Ababa (41.2%)
and the national urban sanitation coverage (27%). Access
to ISC in rural areas of the country is only 2.5%. However,
access to unsanitary toilets substantially increased, up to

63% in 2014, due to the implementation of the national
health extension program by the federal MoH in 2004; the
program deployed 30,000 community health workers in
all communities.

Several researchers have reported that lack of access
to improved sanitation forces the urban poor to use
unhygienic pit latrines or polythene bags and/or discharge
into nearby open storm drains and natural watercourses,
creating severe environmental contamination and
disease-related hazards [18-20]. Open defecation is
common practice (37%) in rural areas of Ethiopia; it
is also practiced by 8.2%, 5.8%, and 8.0% of slum residents
in Addis Ababa, the total Addis Ababa population, and all
urban areas of the country, respectively. The majority of
Addis Ababa’s slum dwellers (88.6%) and 73% of its total
population use unimproved sanitation facilities, showing
that the urban poor are the population segment with the
poorest access to sanitation services [6]. In conclusion,
urban sanitation coverage is far from the MDG target and
the majority of urban residents live with high health and
environmental risks.

Most attention on monitoring sanitation growth
worldwide has focused on household-level inventories
(type and number of toilet infrastructures), ignoring
proper utilization and user behavior [15]. The Ethiopian
national inventories by different organizations such as
MoH, JMP, and CSA lack data on utilization of improved
sanitation technologies and user behavior, precluding a
proper evaluation of the current state of access to improved
sanitation. As indicated by Bartram and Cairncross
[2], different levels of access along the sanitation ladder
provide widely varying health benefits. For instance, the
change from open defecation to the use of improvised
latrines is a step forward but is unlikely to offer health
benefits unless the latrine provides an adequate barrier
between the users and their excreta. These incomparable
sanitation coverage data resulted mainly from the absence

Page 6 of 8

of detailed guidelines and appropriate tools. Hence, in
post-2015 MDGs, guidelines and tools should consider
functions of sanitation systems in a closed-loop approach
(using waste as a potential resource by both purifying and
recycling) and examine user behavior in addition to using
the hierarchy of predefined sanitation technologies as
depicted in the sanitation ladder.

Dry pit latrines (both improved pit latrines and simple
pit latrines), used by 92.5% of the Ethiopian population,
require regular maintenance, particularly pit emptying
and proper fecal sludge management (FSM). In the national
inventory, pit levels, pit emptying practices, and FSM are
not documented. FSM, the most important sanitation elem-
ent, is also largely ignored in the global estimation of
improved sanitation coverage. Baum et al. [12] indicated
that estimating toilet facilities connected to sewage without
treating and redefining them as unimproved sanitation
reduced the estimates of improved sanitation coverage in
2010 by about 22%. Adequate treatment and valorization of
fecal sludge have been absent in Ethiopia. As a result, none
of the sanitation facilities in Ethiopia would qualify as
improved sanitation facilities if the chain FSM system was
included as a monitoring criterion. Hence, access to
improved sanitation in the post-MDG era should also
consider adequate treatment and valorization of fecal
sludge as indicators of access to ISC.

Trends in access to improved sanitation coverage
Although the trend of access to sanitation coverage in
Ethiopia increased from 4% in 1990 to 47.9% in 2014, it
falls short of the MDG target of 56%. Whereas the
discrepancies in the trend analyses by the AGR and
the JMP on one hand and the Ethiopian-CSA on the
other can be explained methodologically, rapid population
growth, high urbanization rates, and lack of political will
to improve sanitation levels are the major drivers of low
ISC in Ethiopia and apparently also in Sub-Saharan Africa
overall. According to the trend analysis by Hopewell and
Graham [21], in 31 major Sub-Saharan Africa cities, nearly
half of them, including Addis Ababa, did not make
progress in reducing open defecation from 2000 to
2012. The slow progress in increasing access to improved
sanitation in Ethiopia and other developing countries can
also be attributed to the lack of contextualized strategies,
policies, and actions [22,23]; weak sectoral coordination;
and low national budget allocation [24].

In addition to the observed differences in trends of
ISC among the reports examined here, higher variability
in ISC trends was observed in AGRs than in the JMP
reports. Strong variability within the AGRs in sanitation
coverage in Ethiopia was reported by Kumie and Ali [25].
Based on our experiences and observations, this variability
appears to be associated with the absence of internal
controls and audits that would ensure the reliability and

----$$$$----$$$$----
Beyene et al. BMC Public Health (2015) 15:451

integrity of reports related to sanitation coverage at each
unit of administration in addition to the lack of standard-
ized methods for gauging access to improved sanitation.
Data routinely reported through government structures
reflect only cumulative totals of facilities based on records
from government-supported programs without follow-up
monitoring to assess their utilization and maintenance.

Debates continue around the issue of how accessibility
of improved sanitation is calculated, pointing out the need
for standardized methods and protocols. For example,
current estimation of access to improved sanitation world-
wide, using type of latrine technology as an indicator, is
inadequate [2,9] without considering the chain of the FSM
system from containment to adequate treatment as well as
proper utilization and user behavior. Only evaluation of
these various components can provide adequate informa-
tion on barriers between latrine users and their excreta.

Although household surveys are generally believed to
provide the most accurate available data, all the appraised
surveys cited in this manuscript lack a clear definition and
boundary for the distinction between urban and rural.
This lack is due in part to the difficulty of distinguishing
between urban and rural communities in Ethiopia [26].
All the household surveys also fail to select representative
samples from both urban and rural populations that con-
sider socioeconomic and cultural attributes to distinguish
different groups.

Limitations

Access to improved sanitation in urban slums was studied
only in the capital city of Addis Ababa, which may not be
representative of the sanitation conditions of towns
nationwide. The sanitation trend does not include annual
variations since the surveys were conducted at several year
intervals. The use of survey data collected from only one
household member might bias results.

Conclusion

Access to improved sanitation is a human right. On the
road to universal access to improved sanitation for all,
more than half of the Ethiopian population has no
access to improved sanitation. In both urban and rural
Ethiopia, access to improved sanitation coverage is far
from the MDG target and the majority of residents are
living with high health and environmental risks. The
high proportion (88.6%) of Addis Ababa urban slum
dwellers and of urban residents nationwide (82.5%) using
unimproved sanitation facilities indicates that the urban
poor have as low sanitation services coverage as the
rural populations. Even this may underestimate actual
coverage, which might be better gauged if the method of
estimating improved sanitation coverage considered the
functioning and utilization of sanitation systems and fecal
sludge management (FSM) rather than simply identifying

Page 7 of 8

and counting available sanitation technologies. Lack of a
standardized monitoring and reporting system has
resulted in big disparities in sanitation trends among
reports that use different monitoring methods. Dry pit
latrines remain the most widely used toilet, accounting for
about 97.5% of the improved sanitation coverage nation-
wide. However, their proper utilization and maintenance
are not included as indicators for measuring access to
improved sanitation coverage. The inadequate progress
towards achieving the MDG target and the need to further
expand sanitation coverage in the post-MDG era require
urgent intensification of current intervention efforts
and developing more coordinated actions. Review of
policies and strategies is also required to improve planning,
implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of sanitation
interventions.
