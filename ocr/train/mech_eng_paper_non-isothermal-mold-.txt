oped for thin part based on the control volume/ finite elem ent method. The nonamiform temperature
distribution and the heat generation during the filling stage are modeled with the lumped temperature
system and the species balance. Numerical algorithm of the simulation are studied. The molding sim-
ulation for a part is performed to show the effectiveness of simulating filling time, temperature distri—
bution and curing degree.

Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) has become
an attractive method in which liquid reactant cures
in a mold with fabric renforcement to produce a
composite part. Interest in these technologies has
erown dramatically, spurred by the military ‘s need
for affordability and high performance and the auto
industry’s emphasis on higher productivity and
low er-v olume market niches.

There are so many technical issues concerned

[13] .
. Because of the anisotrop-—

with RTM processes
ic nature of the reinforcement fibers, the flow pat-
tern in the mold can be very complicated. Cure of

resins utilizes heat to cause a crosslinking reaction.

The rate of the reaction is dependent on the tem-
perature and extent of resin conversion. Heat gen-
eration and transfer can result in a non-uniform
temperature distribution in the mold.

Owing to the interaction of different variables
and the complexity of the process, mold and pro-
cess design are currently conducted using trial and
error. Experimental methods for optimization of
mold and process design may be too time consum—
ing and economically prohibitive. A compute nu-
merical simulation model capable of predicting resin
flow behavior, pressure gradient inside the mold,

and curing process is needed to optimize injection

port positions, mjection pressure, filling time,
temperature, and curing degree.

A number of studies have developed non-
isothermal flow models with a heat transfer mod-
el”! These models are coupled by the fluid vis—
cosity, which is the function of both temperature
and cure conversion. However, most of them are
concentrated on two-dimensional by simplifying
the heat transfer form. In the actual case, the
thermal effects are three-dimensional and require
three-dimensional analysis. There are some studies
on the nonasothermal RTM mold filling and cur-
ing processing with true three-dimensional analy—

. [1043 ;
sis, the huge computation

Unfortunately ,
time limits its application. Moreover, three-dimen-
sional model makes the numerical algorithm more
complicated.

In order to improve the two-dimensional mod-
el and avoid the huge com putation time and numer-
ical algorithm difficulty in the three-dimensional
model, a 2. 5D simulation RTM non-sothermal
model is proposed for thin part in this paper. The
meaning of 2. 5D 1s that the flow is 2D while the
heat transfer is 3D. In this 2. 5D model, the flow
is determined by Darcy’s law and the heat transfer
and resin reaction are developed based on the
lumped tem perature system (i.e. local thermal e—
quilibrium between resin and fiber). The control
volume’ finite element method (CV/FEM) is used

to solve the distributions of pressure, temperature

and curing degree during the RTM processing.

1 Simulation Scheme

1.1 Governing equations

In order to simulate the mold filling process of
RTM, several assumptions must be made to sim-
plify the problem. In general, the fiber reinforce—
ment in the mold cavity is assumed to be rigid dur-
ing the molding process. There is no exchange of
mass between the solid and the fluid. The fluid is
considered as incompressible and its viscosity is in—
dependent of shear rate (i.e., the fluid is Newto-
nian). Inertia effect is neglected because of the low

resin tlow. “Surface ténston 1s’ rreelig ible as “com

pared with the dominant viscous force.
Under these assumptions, Darcy’s law for
flow through porous media can be used as the mo-

mentum equation.

where v is the velocity vector, VP is the pressure
gradient, HL is the viscosity, and K is the perme—
ability tensor. For the part with small thickness,

In RTM process, if the temperature is as—
sumed to be in local equilibrium at any specific time
due to its slow filling speed (i. e., the temperature
is the same for both resin fluid and fiber mat at
each local position), the equations of energy and

species balance can be ex pressed as

the parameter F represents the status of each con-
trol volume in the flow domain. F is zero for an
em pty control volume, while it is | for an entirely
filled control volume. For a partially filled control
volume, F is equal to the volume fraction occupied
by the resm. Pressure is assumed vanished at the
flow front where the temperature and conversion
follow the energy and mass balance of a control
mass. For the case of specified injecting flow rate,

a specified flow rate is assigned to the control vol—

umes enclosing the inlet nodes. For the case of the
specified injecting pressure, a specified pressure is
assigned to the inlet nodes. For the outlets, the
pressure depends on the filling condition. If the
vacuum is used during mold filling, the outlet pres—
sure is equal to the vacuum pressure; otherwise,
the outlet pressure is zero.
1.3 Computation schemes

Eqs- (4) 46) are the governing formulations
of non-sothermal mold processes. The solution of
them requires the use of a numerical method to
find the distribution of pressure, temperature and
resin conversion within the filled domain. CV/
FEM has many advantages in solving the moving

boundary problems” an

In the CV/FEM, the entire calculation do-
main is first divided into a number of elements.
The control volume is formed based on the nodes
of the adjacent elements. Each element is divided
into several sub-areas by the lines connecting the
centroid of the element to the midpoint/ center of
each side/ surface. A control volume is composed of
several sub-area/ volumes, which have a common
node at the center of the control volume. Fig. | is

the typical control volume distribution.

For 2.5 D non-sothermal case, the heat
transfer must be solved in three dimensions. Thus
the cavity should be discretised through the thick-
ness, which involves sub-dividing each control vol-
ume defined for the flow analysis into a number of
layers. The energy balance is then carried out
within each of these sub-domains. The layers
through the thickness can be divided with collocate
method

trol volumes enclosing the inlet nodes are filled
with fluid. Then, with the boundary conditions
mentioned earlier and the assumed viscosity, the
pressure calculation is conducted to determine the
pressures of nodes that are currently filled with flu-
id. After the pressure field is determined, the ve-
locity field can be evaluated according to Darcy’s
law. Then, the temperature and conversion can be
solved by the same way as the pressure based on
the current velocity field. The resulting tempera-
tures and conversions are used to compute the up-—
date viscosity. New values of viscosity are used to
calculate the pressure field again, which leads to
the same calculation procedure.

The Courant Number in the above numerical
scheme is used in the improvement of convergence
and accuracy of the solution. The convergence
problem comes from the convection terms in equa-
tions (5) and (6).

gence, the convection terms of the two equations

In order to reduce the diver—

are evaluated using the upwind scheme. The up-
wind scheme adds a numerical diffusion term to the
system and reduces the instability. However, it in-
creases the truncation errors. The truncation er-
rors may result in a meaningless solution even
though the scheme is stable. They are sensitive to
the flow velocity, mesh size and time step if the

flow is convection dominant. A ‘sub-ttime step Is

used in the numerical model to improve the com pu-
tational accuracy of temperature and conversion
with reasonable Courant Number'”. T his sub+ime
technique can ensure the solutions to be as accurate
as possible, although the truncation error is still
very difficult to control because of the varying

mesh sizes in the model.

Fig. 4(a) shows the predicted flow pattern.
In this figure, the initial radial flow quickly be-
comes rectilinear until the cut-out is reached. Once
the flow passes the cut-out the two flow fronts
merge, after which the flow becomes rectilinear a-
gain. The total fill time for this case is approxi—
mately 3.8 seconds. Fig.5(b) is the flow patter in
reference [9]. It can be found that the predicted
flow pattern is in a good agreement with those in
reference [ 9]. The difference in filling time comes
from the fact that the model in reference [9] does
not consider the in-plane heat conduction which af-

fects the resin viscosity.

3 Conclusion

A 2.5 D non-sothermal RTM_ simulation
model is developed for the thin part based on the
CV/FEM. The lumped temperature system and
the species balance are used in modeling the non-u-
niform temperature distribution and the heat gen-
eration during filling stage. The convergence and
accuracy of numerical schemes are studied and sim-
ulation for a part is performed. Compared with 2D
model, 2.5D model do affect the flow pattern, fill-
ing time, distributions of temperature and cure
conversion in RTM process.

To verify the process model, experimental
work is needed. Results from the experimental

study and the comparison with the numerical simu-

lation are the future study in this area.
