MEMORANDUM FOR: HEADS OF FEDERAL AGENCIES, GENERAL COUNSELS,

AND CIVIL RIGHTS HEADS
FROM: THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CL.
SUBJECT: Federal Government’s Renewed Commitment to Language Access

Obligations Under Executive Order 13166

Executive Order 13166! was issued in August of 2000 and this memorandum reaffirms
its mandate. The Executive Order has two primary parts. First, it directs each federal agency to
develop and implement a system by which limited English proficient (LEP) persons can
meaningfully access the agency’s services. Second, it directs each agency providing federal
financial assistance to issue guidance to recipients of such assistance on their legal obligations to
take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access for LEP persons under the national origin
nondiscrimination provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and implementing
regulations.

Whether in an emergency or in the course of routine business matters, the success of
government efforts to effectively communicate with members of the public depends on the
widespread and nondiscriminatory availability of accurate, timely, and vital information. Events
such as the HIN1 influenza pandemic, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Gulf oil spill, and the
2010 Decennial Census highlight the need for federal agencies to ensure language access both in
their own activities, as well as in those of the recipients of federal financial assistance.

Despite the legal and public service obligations that compel federal agencies and
recipients to ensure language access, a 2006 language access survey of the federal government
revealed significant variations in the extent to which federal agencies are aware of, and in
compliance with, principles of language access. This conclusion is buttressed by an April 2010
Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on language access at federal agencies. That
report offers concrete suggestions, some of which are incorporated in this memorandum, for
improving our efforts to comply with Executive Order 13166. Further, federal interagency
language access conferences held over the last few years reveal that, while the federal
government as a whole has taken commendable strides toward providing language access in

' 65 Fed. Reg. 50,121 (Aug. 16, 2000).

Obligations Under Executive Order 13166

certain areas, the implementation of comprehensive language access programs remains uneven
throughout the federal government and among recipients of federal financial assistance,
especially in the face of limited resources and personnel.

In an effort to secure the federal government’s full compliance with Executive Order
13166, and under the Department of Justice’s (DOJ’s) coordination authority conferred by
Executive Order 12250, I request that your agency join DOJ in recommitting to the
implementation of Executive Order 13166 by undertaking the following action items:

(1) Establish a Language Access Working Group that reflects your agency’s
organizational structure and is responsible for implementing the federally conducted
and federally assisted provisions of the Executive Order.

(2) Evaluate and/or update your current response to LEP needs by, among other things,
conducting an inventory of languages most frequently encountered, identifying the
primary channels of contact with LEP community members (whether telephonic, in
person, correspondence, web-based, etc.), and reviewing agency programs and
activities for language accessibility.

(3) Establish a schedule to periodically evaluate and update federal agency LEP
services and LEP policies, plans, and protocols. As an initial step, within six
months after the date of this memorandum, submit updated LEP plans and an
anticipated time frame for periodic reevaluation of LEP plans and related
documents to the Federal Coordination and Compliance Section (previously named
the Coordination and Review Section) of DOJ’s Civil Rights Division.

(4) Ensure that agency staff can competently identify LEP contact situations and take
the necessary steps to provide meaningful access.

(5) Notify the public, through mechanisms that will reach the LEP communities you
serve, of your LEP policies, plans, and procedures, and LEP access-related
developments. Provide a link to materials posted on your website to the Federal
Coordination and Compliance Section so that it can be posted on LEP. gov.

(6) When considering hiring criteria, assess the extent to which non-English language
proficiency would be necessary for particular positions or to fulfill your agency’s
mission.

(7) For written translations, collaborate with other agencies to share resources, improve
efficiency, standardize federal terminology, and streamline processes for obtaining
community feedback on the accuracy and quality of professional translations
intended for mass distribution.

(8) For agencies providing federal financial assistance, draft recipient guidance. Note
that such assistance is broadly defined to include not only financial grants, but also
equipment, property, rental below fair market value, training, and other forms of
assistance. Agencies that have not already done so should issue recipient guidance
on compliance with language access obligations, and submit that guidance to the
Federal Coordination and Compliance Section of DOJ’s Civil Rights Division
within six months after the date of this memorandum. Agencies that have
determined that they do not provide federal financial assistance and, therefore, do

not need to issue recipient guidance, should include a statement of this
determination when transmitting the federally conducted language access plan.”
Federal funding agencies should also regularly review recipient compliance, and
provide vigorous technical assistance and enforcement action in appropriate cases.

DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, in cooperation with the Federally Conducted Committee of
the Interagency Working Group on Limited English Proficiency, will undertake periodic
monitoring of these action items through follow-up language access surveys of the type
distributed in 2006. Agencies should expect the first of these follow-up surveys in 2011.

For your convenience, the addendum to this memorandum contains a variety of useful
information, including links to resources and further guidance on some of the action items
outlined above. Should you require further technical assistance or support in implementing the
goals of Executive Order 13166, please do not hesitate to contact Christine Stoneman, Special
Legal Counsel, or Bharathi Venkatraman, Attorney, at the Federal Coordination and Compliance
Section, at (202) 307-2222. Thank you for your continued commitment to ensuring that federal
resources and services are available and accessible to the LEP community and the public as a
whole.

* Agencies disputing coverage under the Executive Order’s provision relating to federally conducted programs and
activities should file with the Department a report indicating the basis for disputing coverage, the number of contacts
they have had with LEP individuals, the frequency of such contacts, and the nature and importance of such contacts.
The report should capture phone contacts, in person contacts, correspondence, and any other interactions with LEP
individuals (including via agency websites). Finally, the report should describe the standards such agencies are
using to determine LEP status.

SUPPLEMENT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL’S MEMORANDUM
TO FEDERAL AGENCIES ON EXECUTIVE ORDER 13166 COMPLIANCE

SPECIFICS OF IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE ACTION ITEMS:

(1)

(2)

(3)

Action Item: Each agency should establish a Language Access Working Group
that reflects its organizational structure and is responsible for implementing the
federally conducted and federally assisted provisions of the Executive Order.

Specifics: The Working Group should be chaired by an LEP Coordinator who
reports to a designee of the Secretary (or to a designee of a Secretary-level official
in charge of the agency). The Working Group should be comprised of individuals
from multiple components or operational subdivisions of the agency, and should
include members from field offices, as appropriate. Members of the Working
Group should be responsible for identifying barriers to language access,
consulting with stakeholders, formulating strategies and responses to overcome
the barriers to meaningful language access, ensuring consistency within the
agency on its federally assisted enforcement activities. They also should be
accountable for implementation. Staff should also be apprised of the agency’s
Language Access Working Group and its mission.

Action Item: Each agency should evaluate and/or update its current response to
LEP needs by, among other things, conducting an inventory of languages most
frequently encountered, identifying the primary channels of contact with LEP
community members (whether telephonic, in person, correspondence, web-based,
etc.), and reviewing agency programs and activities for language accessibility.

Specifics: Agencies may need to update program operations, services provided,
outreach activities, and other mission-specific activities to reflect current language
needs. Further, each agency should ensure that its in-house and contract language
services, directory of translated documents, signs, and web-based services meet
current language needs.

Action Item: Each agency should establish a schedule to periodically evaluate and
update agency LEP services and LEP policies, plans, and protocols. As an initial
step, updated LEP plans and an anticipated time frame for periodic reevaluation
of LEP plans and related documents should be submitted within six months after
the date of this memorandum to the Federal Coordination and Compliance
Section of the Department of Justice’s (DOJ’s) Civil Rights Division.

Specifics: Requested information can be sent to the Federal Coordination and
Compliance Section at 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW (NW Bldg), Washington,
D.C. 20530, Attention: Christine Stoneman and Bharathi Venkatraman. You
may also email information to christine.stoneman@usdoj.gov or
bharathi.a.venkatraman@usdoj.gov. Note that an agency’s contemplated
schedule should not serve to bar the agency from conducting more frequent

inventories/reinventories of languages encountered to ensure that agency services
are meeting current language needs and demands.

Action Item: Agencies should ensure that staff can competently identify LEP
contact situations and take the necessary steps to provide meaningful access.

Specifics: Agency staff should be able to, among other tasks, identify LEP
contact situations, determine primary language of LEP individuals, and
effectively utilize available options to assist in interpersonal, electronic, print, and
other methods of communication between the agency and LEP individuals.

Action Item: Agencies should notify the public, through mechanisms that will
reach the LEP communities it serves, of its LEP policies and LEP access-related
developments.

Specifics: Examples of methods for publicizing LEP access information include,
but are not limited to, posting on agency websites, issuing print and broadcast
notifications, providing relevant information at “town hall” style meetings, and
issuing press releases. Agencies should consult with their information technology
specialists, civil rights personnel, and public affairs personnel to develop a multi-
pronged strategy to achieve maximum and effective notification to LEP
communities.

Action Item: When considering hiring criteria, agencies should assess the extent
to which non-English language proficiency would be necessary for particular
positions or to fulfill an agency’s mission.

Specifics: Determine whether the agency would benefit from including non-
English language skills and competence thresholds in certain job vacancy
announcements and position descriptions.

Action Item: For written translations, collaborate with other agencies to share
resources, improve efficiency, standardize federal terminology, and streamline
processes for obtaining community feedback on the accuracy and quality of
professional translations intended for mass distribution.

Specifics: Agencies should actively participate in the Interagency Working
Group’s efforts to develop collaborations and clearinghouse options to produce
high quality and effective translations. While improving efficiency is a priority,
ensuring the quality of translations is equally, if not more, important. As such,
agencies should avoid pursuing free translations from community groups. Rather,
community input can serve to ensure that professional translations meet
community needs and are appropriate to the audience.

----$$$$----$$$$----
(8) Action Item: For agencies providing federal financial assistance, draft recipient
guidance.

Specifics: Agencies should refer to the DOJ Recipient Guidance document and
LEP.gov, both of which are referenced in the Resources section below, for
templates. Agencies should submit their recipient guidance documents for review
and approval to the Federal Coordination and Compliance Section of DOJ’s Civil
Rights Division, at 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW (NW Bldg), Washington, D.C.
20530, Attention: Christine Stoneman and Bharathi Venkatraman. You may also
email agency recipient guidance to christine.stoneman(@usdoj.gov or
bharathi.a.venkatraman@usdo].gov.
