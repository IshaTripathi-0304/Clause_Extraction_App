without the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party; provided, however, that each party hereto may
furnish the other’s Confidential Information to those employees or representatives of such party who need
to have access to such Confidential Information to assist such party in achieving the Purpose of this
Agreement. As a condition to such disclosure, the Receiving Party must inform its employees and
representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and the terms of this Agreement

to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as is the Receiving Party. Each party hereto is responsible for

property of Disclosing Party, and no right or license is granted to Receiving Party with respect to any
Confidential Information. Upon the termination by either party of discussions concerning the Purpose of
this Agreement, or sooner if so requested by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will return to the
Disclosing Party or destroy all Confidential Information, including all copies of the same. Upon request,
the fact of any such destruction must be certified in writing to the Disclosing Party by an officer of the
Receiving Party. Nothing in this Agreement obligates either party hereto to disclose any information to
the other or creates any agency or partnership relation between them.

5. Compelled Disclosure. If either party hereto, as Receiving Party, is requested or required
by legal or administrative process to disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, such
Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party of such request or requirement so that such
Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other relief. In any case, such Receiving
Party will (a) disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which the Receiving Party’s legal
counsel advises is required to be disclosed, (b) use best efforts to ensure that such Confidential Information
is treated confidentially, and (c) notify such Disclosing Party as soon as reasonably practicable of the items
of Confidential Information so disclosed.

6. No Warranty. ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS.”
NEITHER PARTY HERETO MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR
PERFORMANCE.

7. Remedies. Each party hereto acknowledges that remedies at law may be inadequate to
protect the other party against any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement, and, without prejudice to
any other rights and remedies otherwise available to the parties hereto, agrees to the granting of injunctive
relief in favor of the other without proof of irreparable harm or the posting of any bond. In the event of
litigation commenced by a party to enforce this Agreement, the primarily prevailing party will be entitled
to recover its costs and expenses in such litigation, including attorneys’ fees and expenses.

8. Transaction. Both parties agree that unless and until final, written definitive agreements
regarding a specific transaction between the parties have been executed and delivered, neither party will be
under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever to extend or expand the relationship beyond the Purpose
of this Agreement, except for the matters specifically agreed to herein.

shall govern all communications of Confidential Information between the parties until terminated by either
party; provided, however, the obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure with respect to Confidential
Information shall continue beyond termination until: (a) such time as the Confidential Information is no

longer deemed to be Confidential Information as more fully set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement or (b)
upon the written consent of the Disclosing Party that the obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure
have ended.

10. Miscellaneous. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
parties’ respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign this Agreement or any
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. Both parties agree not to issue or release any articles, advertising, publicity or
other matter relating to the existence of this Agreement or any Confidential Information (including the fact
that a meeting or discussion has taken place between the parties) or mentioning or implying the name of
the other party, except as may be required by law and then only after providing the other party with an
opportunity to review and comment thereon. In the event that any one of the provisions contained in this
Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions contained in this Agreement
will not in any way be affected or impaired by such a finding. No waiver of any provisions of this
Agreement will be valid unless the same is in writing and signed by the party against whom such waiver is
sought. A waiver or consent given by either party on any one occasion is effective only in that instance
and will not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right on any other occasion. This Agreement
contains the entire agreement of the parties, supersedes any and all prior agreements, written or oral,
between them relating to the subject matter hereof, and may not be amended unless agreed to in writing by
each party. The rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement are in addition to, not in lieu of,
all rights and obligations under applicable statutory and common law with respect to the other’s
Confidential Information. This Agreement is governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (without regard to its conflict of laws provisions).
