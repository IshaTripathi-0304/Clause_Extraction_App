Introduction Autophagy is well known as one of the biogenic
responses against various stresses, which possesses the beneficial roles
for survival, but little is known about the dynamics and its significance
during the septic condition. We hypothesized that autophagy is
induced during the septic condition, and contributes to protect from
tissue damage which subsequently leads to organ dysfunction. We
confirm whether the autophagic process is accelerated or sustained in
an acute phase of sepsis and we also determine its physiological role.
Methods Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in
mice. We examined the kinetics of autophagosome and autolysosome
formation which may explain the status of autophagy by western
blotting, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. To investigate
a precise role of autophagy in CLP-induced sepsis, chloroquine, an
autophagy inhibitor, was administered to the CLP-operated mice, and
blood chemistry, pathology of the liver and survival were evaluated.
Results Autophagy demonstrated by the ratio of LC3-lII/LC3-l was
induced over the time course up to 24 hours after CLP. The ratio was
particularly increased in the liver, heart and spleen. Autophagosome
formation became maximal at 6 hours and declined by 24 hours after
CLP. Autolysosome formation as evaluated by both fusion of GFP-LC3
dots with LAMP1 immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy
was also increased after the procedure. Furthermore, inhibition of
autophagy by chloroquine during the CLP procedure resulted in
elevation of serum AST levels, and significantly increased mortality in
mice.

Conclusion Autophagy was induced in several organs over the time
course of the CLP sepsis model and then the process was gradually
completed to degradation of the components. Our data suggest
autophagy plays a protective role in organ dysfunction in sepsis.

Introduction Acute myocardial depression in septic shock is common

[1]. Myocardial depression is mediated by circulating depressant
substances, which until now have been incompletely characterized [2].

C BioNied Central © 2013 BioMed Central Ltd

The aim of our study was to observe the effects of TNFa on the model
of perfused rat heart.

Methods After profound anesthesia with pentothal, the Wistar rats
were killed by exsanguination. After sternotomy, the heart was taken
and connected to the Langendorf column. The apex of the heart was
hooked to a strength sensor. Biopac student laboratory software was
used to record and analyse heart contractions. Contractions were
recorded every 5 minutes during periods of 20 minutes. Control
measurements were first recorded. We measured four parameters:
heart rate, contraction force, speeds of contraction and relaxation
for control, during TNFa (20 ng/ml) exposure and after removal of
TNFa. We express the variations of parameters as percentage of
the control + SEM. A paired t test was used to compare heart rate,
contraction amplitude, speeds of contraction and relaxation with TNFa
and control measurements and after removal of TNFa.

Results Eight rat hearts Wistar (weight = 325 + 23 g) were studied. See
Table 1.

Table 1 (abstract P2)

TNFa Removal of TNFa
Heart rate 78 + 6* 9145
Contractile 62 + 8* 91 +4
Speed of contraction 72 +6* 9342
Speed of relaxation 53+ 10* 89+4

Results expressed as percentage of control + SEM. *P <0.05.

Conclusion TNFa decreases significantly the heart rate, contractile

force, speeds of contraction and relaxation on isolated perfused

rat heart. TNFa probably plays a role in the pathophysiology of

cardiomyopathy during septic shock. The partial reversibility of these

effects could explain why left ventricular hypokinesia in patients with

septic shock is reversible.

Introduction The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) is
a physiological mechanism that inhibits cytokine production and
minimizes tissue injury during inflammation. CAP-mediated anti-
inflammatory signals in vagal efferent nerve fibers result in the
release of acetylcholine, which interacts with innate immune cells that
express the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit a7 (a7nAChR).

Endothelial dysfunction during sepsis is responsible for increased
endothelial permeability, leukocyte-endothelial interaction and
functional breakdown of microvascular perfusion. Endotoxemia-
induced endothelial dysfunction can be reduced by cholinergic CAP
activation [1]. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the
a7nAChR-agonist cdp-choline on microcirculatory alterations during
experimental endotoxemia.

Methods Using fluorescent intravital microscopy, we determined
venular wall shear rate, macromolecular efflux and leukocyte
adhesion in mesenteric postcapillary venules of male Wistar rats.
Endotoxemia was induced over 120 minutes by intravenous infusion
of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Control groups received an equivalent
volume of saline. Cdp-choline was applied as an i.v. bolus in treatment
groups. Animals received either (i) saline alone, (ii) cdp-choline
10 minutes prior to saline administration, (iii) cdp-choline 10 minutes
prior to LPS administration, (iv) cdp-choline 30 minutes after LPS
administration or (v) LPS alone.

Results There were no significant differences in venular wall shear
rate between the groups after 120 minutes. There was no significant
difference in the number of adhering leukocytes between the cdp-
choline/LPS groups (iii, iv) and the LPS group after 120 minutes.
Macromolecular efflux significantly increased in all groups over
120 minutes. All groups (i, ii, iii, iv) showed a significantly reduced
macromolecular efflux compared with the LPS group after 120 minutes.
Conclusion Cdp-choline has no effect on leukocyte-endothelial
interaction and microhemodynamic alterations during endotoxemia.
By activating the CAP, cdp-choline reduces capillary leakage. Thus cdp-
choline might have a prophylactic and therapeutic anti-inflammatory
effect on LPS-induced endothelial permeability. These findings
identify the endothelium as a target of anti-inflammatory cholinergic
mediators and cdp-choline as a potential therapeutic substance in
sepsis treatment.

Introduction The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immune
response of patients susceptible to infection by Gram-positive bacteria
after ex vivo provocation with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and to compare
the reaction with the one of healthy adults.

Methods Blood sample was obtained from 10 healthy volunteers, 10
hemodialysis patients with end-stage chronic renal failure (CRF), 10
patients with type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and 10 ICU patients on the
second day of hospitalization, who suffered nonseptic SIRS and had
an APACHE II score >25. After suitable treatment the samples were
incubated with 1 mg LTA for 8 hours and maintained at —20°C until the
measurement of cytokines TNFa, IL-6, IL-1B, and IL-10, using the ELISA
method. The results are presented as mean values + SEM. Graph Pad 4.0
was used, applying a t test to test the variation of each cytokine in each
group, and ANOVA to assess the differences between the four groups.

Results Baseline cytokine values in the three groups were increased
compared with the control group, but the difference was significant
only for the ICU group (Table 1, data only for IL-6 and IL-10). The
quotient IL-10/IL-6 of baseline values was between 0.23 and 0.96
among healthy, ESRD and DM persons, and 1.32 among ICU patients.
In all examined groups the levels of cytokines increased significantly
after stimulation with LTA, although ICU patients showed a differential

response (a fivefold to ninefold rise compared with other groups who
had an increase of 14-fold to 36-fold).

Conclusion Severely ill patients and secondarily hemodialysis and
diabetic patients are in a proinflammatory state. The response of
all examined groups to provocation by LTA was sufficient, with a
differential expression of severely ill patients, a fact that reflects their
different immunologic status.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P5 (doi: 10.1186/cc11943)

Introduction In septic patients, the oxygen radical (OR) showed toxic
effect to induce inflammation and antioxidant activity could affect organ
dysfunction. This study was designed to determine the relationship
between antioxidant level and severity of organ dysfunction.
Methods The medical records of adult patients managed in a surgical
ICU from August 2012 to December 2012 were reviewed prospectively.
Abstracted data included age, body weight (with BMI), APACHE II
scores, SOFA scores, MODS scores, fluid intake, fluid output, nutritional
support, shock, antioxidant levels, OR activities, zinc and selenium
levels, complication and mortality. In addition, length of stay (LOS) in
the ICU and in hospital, and in-hospital mortality were collected. These
data were investigated on the first, the third and the seventh day,
respectively.

Results A total of 13 patients were enrolled. The in-hospital mortality

rate was 7.7% and mean LOS in the ICU and hospital was 6.5 and 27.6,

respectively. Mean APACHE II score was 20.2. On the first day of ICU, the

mean antioxidant level and OR were 1.5 (+ 0.5) mmol/l and 1.6 (+ 0.5)

mmol/l, respectively. At the same time, SOFA and MODS scores were

7.3 and 5.0, respectively, and zinc and selenium were 32.6 yg/dl and

68.4 ng/ml. On the third day, mean antioxidant and OR were 1.5 (+ 0.4)

and 1.8 (+ 0.7) respectively (SOFA 6.6, MODS 4.9, zinc 50.0, selenium

70.7). On the seventh day, mean antioxidant and OR were 1.4 (+ 0.5)

and 1.9 (+ 0.7), respectively (SOFA 4.3, MODS 3.1, zinc 62.8, selenium

77.3). In the correlation analysis, MODS scores and antioxidant level

had significant correlations on the first and seventh days of ICU (P =

0.001, P = 0.009).

Conclusion Antioxidant level had a correlation with organ dysfunction

which might be used as a prognostic factor in critically septic patients.

To prove this, large-scale data collection is required.

anti-inflammatory compensatory response. However, controversies
exist regarding the status of the immune system in local tissue
compartments during sepsis. The aim of this study was to compare
selected markers of activation between the systemic circulation and
local lung environment.

Methods Twenty patients with severe sepsis were included into this
study. Peripheral blood (PB) samples and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(BALF) samples were obtained on the day of diagnosis (D1). BALF was
collected from 11 patients. Samples were stained with antibodies:
CD15/CD64 and CD3/CD14/HLA-DR and isotypic control. Cells were
analysed by flow cytometry. Expression of markers of activation was
analysed as the geometric median of fluorescence (GMF). All values
are expressed as median values. Comparisons between groups were
performed using Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests.

Results The mortality of sepsis reached 70%. Nonsurvivors had
significantly (P = 0.001) elevated expression of CD64 on neutrophils.
Expression of HLA-DR was higher in monocytes from BAL than PB
GMF (1,032 vs. 342; P = 0.02) and this tendency was present in sepsis
originating from both pneumonia and peritonitis. Percentage of HLA-
DR-positive T cells was lower in PB than in BAL (2.9% vs. 6.5%; P = 0.07),
but the GMF values for HLA-DR were higher in the circulating T cells
(1,904 vs. 1,346; P = 0.004). The expression of CD64 on neutrophils was
not significantly different in PB and BAL, but there was a trend towards
its higher expression in BAL from patients with pneumonia while its
expression was higher in PB of patients with peritonitis.

Conclusion In this study we noticed that during sepsis some significant
differences in the status of activation of immune cells exist between
peripheral blood and lung resident cells. The lung milieu seems to
promote activation of monocytes while neutrophil activation is more
dependent on the site of infection. However, these observations
require further studies in a larger group of patients.

Anti-inflammatory effects of Kupffer cells through a7-nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors

Y Li, X Shi

Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China
Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P7 (doi: 10.1186/cc 141945)

Introduction Nicotine exerts anti-inflammatory effects in several cell
types. a7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a7-nAChR), which has
high permeability to calcium, is believed to contribute significantly to
nicotinic anti-inflammatory effects. However, the molecular mechanism
is largely unknown. Kupffer cells in the liver play an important role in
inflammatory response to pathogens invading, but whether there is
a7-nAChR expression in Kupffer cells or cholinergic anti-inflammatory
pathway involved in this process remains unclear.

Methods (1) Kupffer cells, isolated by collagenase digestion and
differential centrifugation from mice and labeled with FITC-aBGT,
were observed under laser scanning confocal microscope to test the
expression of a7-nAChR. Protein level was also tested by western
blotting, with RAW264.7 as positive control; (2) 100 nM LPS was
given to Kupffer cells, with or without 1 mM nicotine. TNFa, IL-10 and
HMGB-1 were tested at 4 hours, 12 hours or 24 hours, respectively; (3)
100 BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four group: Group | (only
lethal dose of LPS was given), Group II (nicotine and LPS were given),
Group III (LPS, nicotine and GdCl3 were given), and Group IV (LPS and
nicotine were given and the left cervical vagus nerve was cut off). The
mortality of mice was observed for 72 hours.

Results (1) Expression of a7-nAChR in Kupffer cells was confirmed
by confocal microscope and western blotting; (2) after nicotine was
administered, the level of TNFa and HMGB-1 increased and the level
of IL-10 decreased. Given left cervical vagus nerve cut off or aBGT,
the effect of nicotine was weakened; (3) Group | had the highest
mortality rate, while in Group II nicotine did reduce the mortality rate
dramatically. After the left cervical vagus nerve was cut off or aBGT
was given, the effects of nicotine were weakened. Difference for the
mortality rate between Group III and Group IV was not significant.

$3

Conclusion Kupffer cells played a crucial rule in modulating

inflammation and the anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine was partially

weakened after left cervical vagus nerve cut off or aBGT was given. It

was verified that left cervical vagus nerve was essential for the anti-

inflammatory effect of nicotine and a7 acetylcholine receptors might

play a critical role.

Introduction Activation of apoptosis in lymphocytes determines
the development of neutropenia and of sepsis [1,2]. We investigated
prevention of sepsis and correction of lymphocyte apoptosis by
recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (hr-GCSF,
filgrastim) [1,2].
Methods With the permission of the ethics committee, a controlled,
randomized, blind clinical trial included 69 term newborns on
mechanical ventilation, without neutropenia and clinical signs of
infection, with a content of lymphocytes in early apoptosis (AnnexinV-
FITC+PI-) of >9.59%, and in late (AnnexinV—FITC+PI+) of 0.56%.
Lymphocytes in apoptosis were detected using antibodies to AnnexinV
and propidium iodide staining method of immunophenotyping (flow
cytometry; Beckman Coulter Epics XL, USA). The survey was conducted
at admission, at 3 to 5 days, and 20 days. The method of random
numbers in Group | included 39 newborns who on admission (with
written parental consent) received an intravenous infusion of hr-GCSF
dose of 10 ug/kg, 3 days. Newborns of Group II (n = 30) did not receive
hr-GCSF. Power of the study was 80% (a <0.05).
Results For 3 to 5 days, Group | significantly decreased apoptosis of
lymphocytes in the early from 16.1% to 7.8%, and in late from 1.3%
to 0.1%. The development of sepsis and neutropenia have been
reported. We observed no clinical or laboratory signs of adverse effects
of the drug. Fatal outcomes (n = 4) are not associated with hr-GCSF,
which was confirmed postmortem. Decreased duration of mechanical
ventilation (P <0.05). In Group II, 27 patients at 3 to 5 days developed
neutropenia and increased lymphocytes in apoptosis (P <0.05). Sepsis
was diagnosed in 19 children; eight fatal outcomes.

Conclusion hr-GCSF reduces the incidence of septic complications and

one of the mechanisms of its clinical effectiveness is the reduction of

apoptotic factors affecting the development of neutropenia.

Introduction Multi-trauma is one of the major indications for intensive
care admission. Recovery is frequently complicated by post-injury
immunological complications, caused by a dysfunctional immune
system; for example, sepsis and multiple organ failure. In order to treat

or prevent this immune paralysis, knowledge on the time course of
immune paralysis in vivo and the pathophysiological mechanisms of
immune paralysis is essential. The aim of this study is to determine
factors that could predict and/or induce immunological complications
in these patients to ultimately find a suitable target and timeframe for
intervention.

Methods Blood was drawn from adult multi-trauma patients (n = 94)
admitted to the emergency room (ER) of the Radboud University
Nijmegen Medical Center. Blood was drawn at the trauma scene by
the helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS), at arrival in the ER
and at days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 after trauma. Plasma concentrations of
TNFa, IL-6, IL-10, IFNy, IL-8 and MCP-1 were determined by Luminex.
Ex vivo 24-hour whole blood stimulations with LPS or pam3cys were
performed and produced TNFa, IL-6 and IL-10 was measured using
ELISA to determine the level of immune paralysis. Clinical data - for
example, Injury Severity Scores, trauma mechanism, medication and
survival — were collected from electronic patient files.

Results The plasma IL-10 concentration at ER was 16.5-fold increased
in comparison with time-point HEMS (P <0.01). Similar but less
pronounced effects were found for IL-8 and MCP-1. A significant
correlation (P = 0.03, R = 0.53) was found between injury severity
scores and IL-10 plasma concentration at time-point ER. Time-courses
of ex vivo produced cytokines suggest that LPS-induced IL-6 and TNFa
production is already decreased in the first few hours after trauma
and recovering from day 5. Ex vivo IL-10 production shows an inverse
pattern.

Conclusion Immune paralysis can be established within hours after
trauma. Production of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in the prehospital phase
could play a crucial role in the pathogenesis. Patients with a higher
injury severity score are more prone to produce excessive IL-10 in this
phase. Immune stimulatory strategies applied by the HEMS or early
after hospital admission could form a potential future approach to
prevent immune paralysis in multitrauma patients in the intensive care
ward.

Is hemoglobin concentration affected by sepsis in the acute phase?
G Jansma, H Buter, RT Gerritsen, EC Boerma

Medical Centre Leeuwarden, the Netherlands

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P10 (doi: 10.1186/cc11948)

Introduction In the acute phase of sepsis several potential mechanisms
may change the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. On the one hand,
endothelial activation may lead to increased vascular permeability and
fluid sequestration to the interstitium, leading to hemoconcentration.
On the other hand, degradation of the glycocalyx has been reported [1].
Shedding of this carbohydrate-rich layer with an estimated thickness of
0.2 to 0.5 um may lead to a substantial increase of the intravascular
space, and thus to decrease of Hb concentration [2]. The aim of this
study is to determine whether there is a decrease in Hb in the acute
phase of sepsis.

Methods In this single-center retrospective analysis we identified
patients with sepsis as the primary reason for non-elective ICU
admission from a standard patient database. Patients who fulfilled the
international criteria of sepsis and organ failure during ICU admission
were included in the sepsis group (S-group). The control group was
formed by patients with other non-elective reasons for ICU admission
(C-group). Exclusion criteria were (recent) bleeding, surgery in the last
6 weeks, chronic renal failure (creat >177 umol/|, or hemodialysis),

S4

hematologic or metastasized malignancies, cardiac arrest, and use of

bone marrow suppressive drugs. Laboratory data were collected from

blood samples, prior to in-hospital i.v. fluid therapy. In order to detect a

difference in Hb concentration of 0.2 mmol/l, we anticipated a sample

size of 283 per group, based ona standard deviation (SD) of 1.2,a=0.05

and B = 0.8. Data are expressed as mean + SD.

Results We included 296 patients in the S-group and 320 in the

C-group. The difference in Hb between the S-group and C-group was

not significant (8.76 + 1.18 mmol/l vs. 8.93 + 1.16 mmol/l, P= 0.07). After

correction for a number of confounders, using a multivariate regression

analysis, we observed a significant difference in Hb of -0.23 mmol/I in

the S-group in comparison with the C-group (P = 0.01).

Conclusion At first presentation, prior to in-hospital i.v. fluid therapy,

Hb concentration in patients with sepsis is significantly lower in

comparison with controls; however, the difference is very small,

without the existence of anemia.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P11 (doi: 10.1186/cc11949)

Introduction Traditional whole blood experiments suggest that sepsis
causes abnormal red blood cell (RBC) deformability. To investigate
this at the cellular level, we employed a novel biophysical method to
observe individual RBC membrane mechanics in patients with septic
shock.

Methods We collected blood samples from patients with septic
shock until either death or day 5 of admission. Thermal fluctuations
of individual RBCs were recorded allowing a complete analysis of RBC
shape variation over time. Mean elasticity of the cell membrane was
then quantified for each sample collected.

Results We recruited nine patients with septic shock. Table 1 shows
mean RBC thermal fluctuation and SOFA scores.

Conclusion RBC thermal fluctuation analysis allows variations in RBC
elasticity during sepsis to be quantified at a cellular level. We could not
identify any specific trend between sepsis severity and erythrocyte
elasticity. Cells demonstrated both increases and decreases in fluctua-
tion independent of SOFA score. This is contrary to current evidence
that suggests RBC deformability is reduced during sepsis.

dysfunction. We used a novel fluctuation microscopy technique to Reference

quantify the effects of CPB on RBC elasticity at a cellular level.
Methods We collected blood samples from elective cardiac surgery
patients pre (at induction) and post (immediately, each day until CICU
discharge) CPB. Thermal fluctuations of individual RBCs were recorded
using a high-frame-rate camera allowing a complete analysis of RBC
shape variation over time. Mean elasticity of the cell membrane was
then quantified for each sample collected.

Results Fifteen patients were recruited. Table 1 displays the results.
RBC thermal fluctuation is measured relative to pre-bypass values. An
increase in RBC fluctuation marks a decrease in stiffness. CPB caused
two distinct changes in RBC elasticity; pre-fix A indicates samples
where stiffness increases or shows no change, B those where stiffness
decreases. Data on day 2 were not collected in patients discharged
from the CICU. CPB type or time had no apparent impact on RBC
response to CPB.

Conclusion RBC thermal fluctuation analysis quantifies the impact
of CPB on erythrocyte membrane elasticity. We clearly identified two
separate RBC elasticity responses to CPB. This finding is contrary to
traditional flow measurement techniques that suggest CPB impairs
whole blood flow and reduces RBC deformability.

Introduction Sepsis causes widespread microvascular injury and
thrombosis. Some hemostatic factors mediate the mechanisms
involved in sepsis-related organ ischemia and failure. Oxidative stress
is also increased in sepsis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) favor
secretion of von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers from endothelium
and inhibit vWF proteolysis by ADAMTS-13. Moreover, the enzyme
indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, an important immune regulator, is
activated in sepsis and, through generation of kynurenins, promotes
antioxidative and anti-infective activities. This study evaluated the
relative role of ADAMTS-13, vWF and fibrinogen in the morbidity and
mortality of patients with septic shock (SS). The above hemostatic
factors were measured together with kynurenine and plasma protein
carbonyls, marker of oxidative stress.

Methods One group of 12 patients with SS, defined using standard
criteria, was enrolled in the ICU of the ‘A. Gemelli’ Hospital (Rome,
Italy). Biochemical, hematologic and hemodynamic parameters were
measured on days 1 to 4, 7, 14 and 21. A group of 12 age-matched and
gender-matched healthy subjects was used as controls.

Results Low ADAMTS-13 activity was observed in SS _ patients
(268 + 123 ng/ml vs. 760 + 80 ng/ml in controls). vWF levels (antigen
and activity) were increased ~3-fold compared with controls. Likewise,
plasma protein carbonyls and kynurenine were globally increased in
patients (2.1 + 1.5 nmol/mg vs. 0.3 + 02 nmol/mg and 14.4 + 9.7 uM
vs. 2.3 + 1.3 uM, respectively). Intra-ICU mortality (3 of 15) was strongly
and inversely correlated with carbonyl levels (P = 0.04) and platelets
(P= 0.022).

Conclusion Hence, we hypothesize that, in the SS setting, platelets
contribute to oxidative stress that counteracts the organ failure-
associated mortality. Thus, low platelet count, irrespective of bleedings,
may favor mortality in SS patients by generating lower ROS amounts.

Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin/lipocalin2, derived from
gut crypt cells, exerts intestinal antimicrobial effect via bacterial
stimulation of Toll-like receptor 4 and 9

Introduction Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin §(NGAL)/
lipocalin2, known as a sensitive biomarker of acute kidney injury,
prevents bacterial iron uptake, resulting in the inhibition of its
overgrowth [1]. We previously demonstrated that this protein was
discharged into gut lumen from crypt cells in septic conditions, and
inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli [2]. However, it remains unclear
which pathway is associated with the upregulation of NGAL. We
therefore designed the present study to reveal whether the pattern-
recognition receptor of bacteria, the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family,
plays a pivotal role for NGAL secretion from gut crypt cells.

Methods With our institutional approval, the ileum and colon of male
C57BL/6J mice (6 to 7 weeks) were everted and washed by Ca?* and
Mg?* free PBS buffer five times. Tissues were incubated with Ca?* and
Mg** free PBS containing 30 mM EDTA for 1 hour to isolate crypt cells
of gut. The cell suspension was filtered through a cell strainer (40 um)
twice, and deposited the crypt cells by centrifugation at 700xg. The
isolated crypt cells were resuspended in PBS and stained with 0.25%
amido black for labeling paneth cells. The 5x10° crypt cells were
resuspended in 50 ml HBSS containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum and
1% penicillin—streptomycin. The crypt cells were incubated at 37°C with
or without TLR ligands: lipopolysaccharide (TLR4 ligand, 10 ug/ml) and
CpG-DNA (TLR9 ligand, 8 ug/ml). After a 2-hour incubation period, the
crypt cells were deposited and eluted MRNA to measure the expression
of both NGAL and TLR mRNA using real-time PCR.

Results More than 70 to 80% of collected cells were stained by amido
black. LPS significantly upregulated the expression of NGAL and TLR4
mRNA in ileum and colon crypt cells (P <0.05). Although the CoG-DNA did
not upregulate NGAL and TLR9 mRNA in ileum crypt cells, the apparent
expression of NGAL and TLR9 mRNA was found in colon crypt cells (P <0.05).
Conclusion Bacterial stimulation of TLR4 and TLR9 pathways plays a
pivotal role in the expression of NGAL mRNA in gut, suggesting that
NGAL, derived from gut crypt cells, could contribute to the regulation
of the intraluminal microflora in the critically ill.

Introduction Most individuals infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1
influenza A virus (IAV) (H1IN1pdm) experienced uncomplicated flu.

----$$$$----$$$$----
Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2
http://ccforum.com/supplements/17/S2

However, in a small subset of patients the infection rapidly progressed
to primary viral pneumonia (PVP) and a minority of them developed
ARDS. Inherited and acquired variability in host immune responses
may influence susceptibility and outcome of IAV infection. However,
the molecular nature of such human factors remains largely elusive.
Methods We report three adult relatives with the autosomal dominant
GATA-2 deficiency. P1 and his son P2 had a history of myelodysplastic
syndrome and a few episodes of mild respiratory infections. They
developed PVP by H1N1pdm which rapidly evolved to ARDS. They died
at the age of 54 and 31, respectively.

Results Patients were heterozygous for a novel R396L mutation in
GATA2. Like other patients with GATA-2 deficiency, the three relatives
had absence of peripheral NK and B cells and monocytopenia. However
a high number of plasma cells, which were found to be pauciclonal,
were observed in peripheral blood from P1 during H1N1pdm infection.
P1 and P2 had normal levels of immunoglobulins and IgG antibodies
against common viruses. Microneutralization test showed that P1
produced normal titers of neutralizing antibodies against H1IN1pdm
and against the previous annual H1N1 strain. Our results suggest that
a few clones of long-living memory B cells against [AV expanded in
P1; and that these cells produced cross-reactive antibodies against
H1Nipdm, similar to those recently described. During the flu episode
P1 had a strong increase of IFNy-producing T cells and of IFNy
production. The Th1-related chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL9, as well as
IFNy, MCP-1 and IL-8, were strongly elevated in serum from P1 and P2
in the course of HIN1pdm infection.

Conclusion GATA-2 deficiency is the first described Mendelian
inborn error of immunity underlying severe IAV infection. Primary
immunodeficiencies predisposing to severe IAV infections may debut,
even in adults without a history of previous severe infections. The
massive IFNy-mediated cytokine storm may explain the fatal course of
H1N1pdm infection in our patients.

Escherichia coli O55:B5 and of 5 ug/ml phytohemagglutin (PHA); TNFa
was measured in supernatants by a bioassay on L929 fibroblasts.
Results Fifty percent of rabbits died early; that is, within the first
48 hours. Mean + SE log,, bacteria in the liver and lung of animals
that died early was 2.27 + 0.62 and 3.16 + 0.78 cfu/g; respective values
of rabbits that started dying late (that is, after 72 hours) were below
the limit of detection. Mean circulating LPS at 24 hours was 2.09 EU/
ml and 1.99 EU/ml respectively (P = NS). Mean LPS of the portal vein
of the sham and of the injury groups were 1.25 and 5.62 EU/ml (P =
0.047). Concentrations of TNFa in splenocyte supernatants are shown
in Figure 1.

Conclusion Early death after injury is not related to peripheral
endotoxemia and sepsis; bacterial translocation priming for enhanced
proinflammatory responses is a likely explanation.

Introduction Adenosine exerts anti-inflammatory and tissue protective
effects during systemic inflammation. While the anti-inflammatory
properties may induce immunoparalysis and impede bacterial
clearance, the tissue protective effects might limit organ damage.
The effects of a common loss-of-function variant of the adenosine
monophosphate deaminase 1 gene (AMPD1), which is associated with
increased adenosine formation, in patients with sepsis are unknown.
Methods In a prospective cohort, genetic-association study, the
effects of the presence of the AMPD1 gene on immune function,
multiorgan dysfunction and mortality in septic patients was studied.
Pneumosepsis patients (n = 402) and controls without infection (n =
101) were enrolled.

Results In pneumosepsis patients and controls, a similar prevalence
of the 34C>T (rs17602729) mutation in the AMPD1 gene was found.
Univariate logistic regression analysis showed a tendency of increased
mortality in patients with the CT genotype, compared with patients
with the CC genotype (OR 1.53; 95% Cl 0.95 to 2.5). Moreover, carriers of
the CT genotype tended to suffer more from multiorgan dysfunction,
OR 1.4 (0.84 to 2.3) and 3.0 (0.66 to 13.8), for CT and TT, respectively
(P = 0.07). In septic carriers of the CT genotype, the ex vivo production
of TNFa by LPS-stimulated monocytes was attenuated (P = 0.005),

indicative for more pronounced immunoparalysis in these patients.
See Figure 1.

Conclusion The presence the 34C>T variant of the AMPD1gene is not
related to infection susceptibility; however, it is associated with more
pronounced immunoparalysis in patients with sepsis, and shows
a tendency towards increased mortality. Mechanistically, the anti-
inflammatory effects of adenosine may account for this and apparently
overrule its tissue protective effects.

Exploring the translational disconnect between the murine and
human inflammatory response: in vitro analysis of the dose-
response relationship of LPS and NFKB activation in murine and
human immune cells

Introduction Inflammation, as seen in sepsis and systemic inflammatory
response, is dependent on the activation of the NFkB pathway through
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [1]. Recreating an inflammatory response
using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can provide results that are different to
clinical sepsis [2]. By examining NFxB activation in murine and human
cells, a species comparison can be made to investigate differences at
the cell level that may contribute to the translational disconnect seen
in vivo.

Methods THP1 human monocytes (passages 9 to 11) and RAW 264.7
murine macrophages (passages 15 to 20) were cultured in RPMI-1640
and DMEM respectively and then challenged with LPS. After settling
for 24 hours, cells were dosed with six or seven doses of LPS. After
1 hour, nuclear extraction and proteins were separated by acrylamide
gel electrophoresis. Membranes where then immunoblotted for actin
and p65, followed by densitometric analysis in order to quantify the
amount of p65 that had translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
(by subtraction from consistent nuclear actin).

Results Murine cells required higher doses of LPS compared with
human cells in order to detect p65 (human, 1 pg/ml to 100 ng/ml;
murine, 30 pg/ml to 1,000 ng/ml). THP1 cells showed a greater fold
increase in the p65:actin ratio compared with RAW 264.7 cells. Human
cells responded to lower concentrations of LPS. Murine cells appeared
to show a molecular resistance to lower doses, but their response was
very sensitive at higher doses. A dose-response relationship of LPS
dosing and NFkB activation was observed in both cell lines.
Conclusion Immunoblotting for p65 is a reliable and reproducible
method to determine NFkB activation in cultured cells. Macrophages
are more responsive to LPS than monocytes [3] so differences between
cell lines would have been expected to be the reverse of what was
observed. The species difference in response to LPS may contribute
to the apparent disconnect between human and murine responses to
LPS and may partially explain the difficulties of translating therapeutic
interventions into clinical human sepsis.

Hypogammaglobulinemia in sepsis is not correlated to high
circulating angiopoietin-2 levels

Introduction Hypogammaglobulinemia has been frequently found
in adult patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Furthermore, it
seems that at least a low serum level of IgM is correlated with higher
mortality in sepsis. The mechanisms of hypogammaglobulinemia in
septic shock have not yet been explained. It has been hypothesized
that outflow of immunoglobulins into the extravascular space due to
increased capillary permeability could reduce immunoglobulin serum
concentrations. Angiopoietin-2, which directly disrupts the endothelial
barrier, is markedly elevated in sepsis and other inflammatory states
and its serum level has been correlated with microvascular leakage,
end-organ dysfunction and death in sepsis.
Methods In the prospective, noninterventional study, we assessed the
correlation between the capillary leakage marker angiopoetin-2 and
serum levels of IgG and IgM in 41 patients with community-acquired
severe sepsis or septic shock on admission. Blood samples were
obtained during the first 12 hours after admission to hospital.
Results Mean age of patients (17 females) was 70 years. Median
APACHE II and SOFA scores at admission were 24 and 11, respectively.
The mortality rate was 45%. Thirty-four percent of all patients had level
of IgG <650 mg/dl. The median concentration of angiopoietin-2 in the
hypo-lgG group was 11,958 pg/ml, which was not statistically different
(Mann-Whitney; P >0.05) than in the rest of patients with normal levels
of IgG (15,688 pg/ml). The concentration of IgM <40 mg/dl was found in
only four patients (10%) and all died. Pearson’s correlation test showed
that the correlation between the concentrations of angiopoietin-2
and IgG (correlation coefficient 0.191) or IgM (correlation coefficient
0.0408), respectively, were not statistically significant (P <0.05).
Conclusion At present the hypothesis that increased microvascular
leakage is responsible for hypogammaglobulinemia in septic patients
could not be accepted. Studies on larger number of patients are
needed. In addition, it is necessary to further explore other possible
mechanisms, such as increased catabolism and consumption of
antibodies or inadequate synthesis of immunoglobulins, which could
also be responsible for hypogammaglobulinemia in sepsis.

to the ICU have an in-hospital mortality of up to 50% [1]. Microbial
translocation (MT) is the pathogenic mechanism implicated in SBP. The
triggering receptor expressed by myelocytes-1 (TREM-1) modulates
the immune response with resultant production of proinflammatory
cytokines and has been used as a biomarker in the diagnosis of bacterial
infection. We wish to evaluate the role of TREM-1 as a biomarker in
cirrhosis.
Methods Blood samples were obtained from 18 healthy controls (HC)
and 29 cirrhotic patients (CA) as defined by clinicoradiological criteria.
Disease severity was graded according to Child-Pugh class (median
10, range 5 to 13) and modified end-stage liver disease (MELD) score
(median 14, range 6 to 21). Simultaneous ascitic fluid samples were
taken from 10 patients in the CA group. Soluble TREM-1 and CD14 levels
(a surrogate marker of MT) were measured by ELISA. Flow cytometry
was used to quantify the expression of TREM-1 on monocytes and
neutrophils in blood and ascitic fluid.
Results TREM-1 expression is significantly higher in the CA group
compared with HC across all monocyte subsets but not neutrophils,
even in the absence of sepsis (see Figure 1). There is no correlation
between cell surface TREM-1 expression and severity of cirrhosis by
Child-Pugh or MELD score. sTREM and sCD14 levels were elevated in
the CA group compared with HC (P = 0.0010 and 0.0016 respectively).
In addition, plasma sTREM-1 levels correlated with disease severity
according to MELD score (R=0.71, Cl=0.22 to 0.92 P=0.012) and serum
bilirubin (R = 0.78,Cl = 0.36 to 0.94, P = 0.004). There was no correlation
with either form of TREM-1 with sCD14 levels. There was no difference
in cell surface or soluble TREM-1 expression between blood and ascitic
fluid monocytes in culture-negative, non-neutrophilic ascites.
Conclusion Blood monocyte and soluble TREM-1 are elevated in
cirrhotic patients even in the absence of sepsis. Soluble TREM-1 levels
correlate with disease severity in cirrhosis. Further studies are ongoing
to ascertain the utility of TREM-1 as a biomarker in cirrhosis.

Introduction The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is highly restrictive of
the transport of substances between blood and the central nervous
system. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria was
reported to affect the permeability of the BBB. BBB disruption using a
LPS is used as a model of septic encephalopathy in mice. The present
study was designed to investigate the effects of different doses and
serotypes of LPS on BBB integrity in Sprague-Dawley rats.

Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 to 250 g were
used in the study. Rats were given two different types of LPS (026:B6-
L5543 and 026:B6-L2762) in different doses (3, 5, and 10 mg/kg; i.v.).
Rectal temperature and arterial blood pressure measurements were
recorded for sepsis severity. The changes in the BBB permeability were
measured using the Evans blue (EB) and sodium fluorescein (NaFl) dye
extravasation techniques 24 hours after LPS administration.

Results Both LPS serotypes showed comparable arterial blood pressure
and rectal temperature recordings and the severity of the disease
increased with the increasing doses (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) of LPS
and the mortality rates were found to be 29% and 63% respectively.
The extravasated contents of EB and NaFl tracers did not significantly
increase in brain parenchyma following the administration of different
doses of LPS with different serotypes.

Conclusion Our results showed no disruption to BBB by two different
serotypes of LPS even administered in increasing doses. These result
indicate that the BBB integrity of Sprague-Dawley rats are resistant to
the effects of two different serotypes of LPS.

Introduction Septic encephalopathy is a frequent complication in
severe sepsis but its pathogenesis and mechanisms are not fully
understood. Oxygen supply and utilization are critical for organ
function, especially for the brain, a tissue extremely dependent on
oxygen and glucose. Disturbances in oxygen utilization are common
in sepsis and a number of mitochondrial dysfunctions have been
described in different tissues in septic animals as well as in septic
patients. Our group described mitochondrial dysfunctions in the brain
during experimental sepsis.

Methods Experimental sepsis was induced by endotoxemia (LPS 10 mg/
kg i.p.) in Sprague-Dawley rats and by polymicrobial fecal peritonitis in
Swiss mice. Brain glucose uptake was observed in vivo in endotoxemic
rats using positron emission tomography with ['8F]fluorodeoxyglucose
and autoradiography with 2-deoxy-'*C-glucose.

Results Mice with polymicrobial sepsis present hypoglycemia,
hyperlactatemia and long-term cognitive impairment. We observed
a rapid increase in the uptake of fluorescent glucose analog 2-deoxy-
2-((7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino)-p-glucose in brain slices
from septic mice in vitro. A similar increase in brain glucose uptake
was observed in vivo in endotoxemic rats. Remarkably, the increase
in glucose uptake started 2 hours after LPS injection, earlier than
other organs. The brains of mice with experimental sepsis presented
neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunctions and oxidative stress,
but mitochondria isolated from septic brains generated less ROS in
vitro in the first 24 hours. This led us to investigate the role of NADPH
oxidase, an enzyme induced during innate immune response, as a
potential source of reactive oxygen species in experimental sepsis.
Inhibiting NADPH oxidase with apocynin acutely after sepsis prevented
cognitive impairment in mice.

Conclusion Our data indicate that a bioenergetic imbalance and
oxidative stress is associated with the pathophysiology of septic
encephalopathy. We are observing a new metabolic phenotype in
the brain during sepsis, characterized by a rapid increase in glucose
uptake and mitochondrial dysfunctions that may be secondary to
inflammation and hypoxia.

Introduction Pathophysiology of brain dysfunction associated
with sepsis is still poorly understood. Potential mechanisms involve
oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier altera-
tions. Our purpose was to study the metabolic alterations and markers
of mitochondrial dysfunction in a clinically relevant model of septic
shock.

Methods Twelve anesthetized (midazolam/fentanyl/pancuronium),
invasively monitored, and mechanically ventilated pigs were allocated
to a sham procedure (n = 5) or sepsis (n = 7), in which peritonitis was
induced by intra-abdominal injection of autologous feces. Animals
were studied until soontaneous death or for a maximum of 24 hours.
In addition to global hemodynamic and laboratory assessment,
intracranial pressure and cerebral microdialysis were assessed at
baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours after sepsis induction. After death,
brains were removed and brain homogenates were studied to assess
markers of mitochondrial dysfunction.

Results All septic animals developed a hyperdynamic state associated
with lower arterial pressure, fever and organ dysfunction in comparison
with control animals. In the septic animals, we observed increased
brain dialysate glutamin levels at 12, 18 and 24 hours after sepsis
induction, as compared with control animals. Moreover, after analyzing
homogenates from the frontal cortex, we found higher concentrations
of glutamin and glutamate in septic as compared with control
animals (85.67 + 14.98 vs. 28.77 + 7.0; P= 0.01 and 132.1 + 19.72 vs.
53.33 + 16.83; P = 0.02, respectively). See Figure 1.

Conclusion We found higher concentrations of glutamate and
glutamin in brain tissues of septic animals as compared with control.
Furthermore, glutamin concentrations increased over time in the
extracellular space as measured by cerebral microdialysis. These
findings suggest an increased excitatory state that is potentially
associated with high energy expenditure. However, associations with
neuronal injury need further study.

Cholinergic modulation of hippocampal activity during septic
encephalopathy

Introduction Septic encephalopathy is a sepsis-related brain dys-
function with a deterioration of cortical functions. The experimental
studies in the rat brain revealed a deranged neurotransmitter profile
during septic encephalopathy. Glutamatergic synapses, essential in
learning and memory, undergo use-dependent changes in synaptic
strength, referred to as plasticity. Permanent strengthening of synapses
after a brief stimulus, termed long-term potentiation (LTP), was
discovered in the hippocampus, and here it has been most thoroughly
studied. Cholinergic neurotransmission plays an important role in
regulating the cognitive functions of the brain. It acts as a signal-to-
noise ratio modulator of sensory and cognitive inputs. The irregularities
in brain functions give rise to the symptoms of delirium, including
disorganized thinking and disturbances of attention and consciousness,
which in turn might affect learning and memory. Possible mechanisms
for cholinergic deficiency include impairment of synaptic functions
of acetylcholine. Imbalances in the cholinergic system during sepsis
might therefore play an extensive role in the septic delirium.

Methods By using MRI imaging we identified functional changes in the
hippocampal region of patients with severe sepsis. This finding was
further supported by the experimental recordings in the rat brains of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated rats using the electrophysiological
patch clamp technique.

S9

Results Critically ill ICU patients diagnosed with septic delirium using
the CAM-ICU method underwent diagnostic MRI scans. The serial MRI
analysis revealed increased signal intensity in the hippocampal region
in diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI).We used endotoxemia model to induce
sepsis in the rats. Electrophysiological analysis of the hippocampal
neurons in LPS-treated rats showed impaired LTP in the excitatory
synapses, as compared with controls. Application of physostigmine, a
blood-brain barrier permeable cholinesterase inhibitor, resulted in a
partial recovery of LTP in the hippocampal synapses of LPS-treated rats.
Conclusion The patients with septic delirium show functional changes
in the hippocampus. Furthermore, we show that endotoxemia affects
synaptic plasticity in the rat hippocampus, suggesting the involvement
of this brain region in the pathophysiology of septic delirium. Moreover,
the effect of the cholinergic neurotransmission onto the induction
and maintenance of synaptic plasticity in the rat hippocampus during
endotoxemia suggests that cholinergic neurotransmission might play a
critical role in septic encephalopathy.

Neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio as a biomarker of severe sepsis
in Escherichia coli infections in adults

'Skaraborgs Sjukhus, Skovde, Sweden; *Gothenburg University, Gothenburg,
Sweden

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P25 (doi: 10.1186/cc11963)

Introduction The neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR) is an
easy to analyse biomarker reacting very early in the course of acute
inflammation. It has previously been reported to correspond to
bacteremia and recently to disease severity in community-acquired
pneumonia [1]. We have looked at 205 consecutive patients with
Escherichia coli infections (ECI) and found the same to be true for
ECls. This may be of great clinical importance since E. coli is the most
frequently isolated pathogen in patients with infections requiring in
hospital care.
Methods This study is part of a 9-month consecutive study of
community-acquired severe sepsis and septic shock in adults at
Skaraborg Hospital in the western region of Sweden. The hospital
serves a population of 256,000 inhabitants and has approximately
60,000 annual visits to the ED. All patients admitted to the hospital
receiving intravenous antibiotic treatment within the first 48 hours
of admission were evaluated for severe sepsis and septic shock. Upon
admission, two sets of blood cultures and other relevant cultures were
obtained from each patient as well as sampling for NLCR and venous
plasma lactate. The patient records were evaluated by one infectious
diseases specialist. Approximately 2,300 patients were diagnosed
as having a bacterial infection. From those, an informed consent to
participate in the study could be obtained from approximately 1,600
patients.
Results Of the 1,600 patients who gave consent to participate in the
study, 205 had an ECI. Sixty-four had a positive blood culture for E. coli.
Fifty of the patients met one or more criteria for severe sepsis or septic
shock. The NLCR was significantly higher (P <0.001) within the severe
sepsis group (median = 21.1 with quartiles 11.1 to 42.4) compared with
the group with no severe sepsis (median = 11.6 with quartiles 7.6 to
18.9).
Conclusion The NLCR can be used as a biomarker of disease severity
even in ECls. The biomarker reacts rapidly, is cheap and needs no extra
sampling. The higher the value, the higher the probability for severe
sepsis. A high value can even precede the development of severe
sepsis or septic shock. However, a low value never excludes neither
bacteremia nor severe sepsis. The method cannot be used in patients
with disturbances in neutrophil or lymphocyte levels due to other
causes than sepsis.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P26 (doi: 10.1186/cc11964)

Introduction Chronic inflammation has recently been recognized as
an important factor in the pathophysiology of obesity and associated
morbidities [1]. In this clinical study we aimed at identifying possible
effects of obesity on inflammatory markers in severe sepsis.
Methods With institutional ethical committee approval, 243
consecutive patients treated for severe sepsis or septic shock in the
ICUs of two university hospitals over a period of 5 months were studied.
Six patients were excluded due to cachexia, syndromal disorders or
missing clinical data. Diagnosis of sepsis was made according to SCCM
criteria. Serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP, mg/l) and procalcitonin
(PCT, ng/ml) on day 1 of sepsis were compared among five body mass
index (BMI) strata according to WHO definitions. Two groups (BMI <30,
normal weight, and BMI =30, obesity) were formed for further analysis,
and PCT was logarithmically transformed (LogPCT), resulting in normal
distribution. Statistical analysis was performed using a t test.
Results Patients with BMI >30 had higher values of PCT and CRP
(Table 1). The difference in LogPCT was of borderline significance (P =
0.052). However, patients with positive blood cultures had significantly
higher LogPCT values (P = 0.017) (Figure 1). Difference in CRP was not
significant (P = 0.09). The trends over all five BMI strata (Table 1) were
not significant.
Conclusion Obesity with BMI =30 seems to be associated with an
increase in inflammatory markers in patients with severe sepsis,
particularly in bacteraemia. The role of adipose tissue in severe sepsis
should therefore be studied in more detail.

Cytokine gene expression can predict infectious complications
following severe trauma

HD Torrance, K Brohi, CJ Hinds, MJ O'Dwyer

Bart’s Health NHS Trust, London, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P27 (doi: 10.1186/cc11965)

Introduction Identifying a group of patients at high risk of developing
infectious complications is the first step in the introduction of effective
pre-emptive therapies in specific patient groups. Quantifying cytokine
gene expression also furthers our understanding of trauma-induced
immunosuppression. Our group has already demonstrated that a
predictive immunological signature derived from mRNA expression in
elective thoracic surgical patients accurately predicts pneumonia risk [1].
Methods In total, 121 ventilated polytrauma patients were recruited.
mRNA was extracted from PaxGene tubes collected within 2 hours
of the initial insult, at 24 and 72 hours. T-helper cell subtype specific
cytokines and transcription factors mRNA was quantified using qPCR.
Ten healthy controls served as a comparator.

Results The Median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 29. Time 0 bloods
demonstrated a reduction in TNFa’, IL-12°, IL-23*, RORyT* and T bet®, and
an increase in IL-10* and IL-4" mRNA levels in comparison with the control

and RORYT* were negatively correlated at time 0. TNFa’, IL-10* and IL-27*
increased and IFNy’, IL-12*, IL-17A’, RORyT* and T bet* mRNA levels
decreased over the initial 24 hours. Subsequent bacteraemia (18/121
patients) was associated with a lower TNFa/IL-10 ratio* at baseline.
Similarly, higher IL-10* and lower T bet* mRNA at 24 hours also predicted
later bacteraemic episodes. Development of pneumonia followed a
similar pattern. A multivariate logistical regression model proved highly
accurate in predicting infectious complications from mRNA analysis of
early blood samples. See Figure 1.

Conclusion Cytokine gene expression patterns indicate an immediate
and sustained impairment in Th1, Th17 and innate immunity with
concurrent upregulation of the Th2 response following major trauma.
The magnitude of this response predicts subsequent infectious
complications.

Introduction The evaluation of sepsis severity is complicated by the highly
variable and nonspecific nature of clinical signs and symptoms. We studied
routinely used biomarkers together with clinical parameters to compare
their prognostic value for severe sepsis and evaluate their usefulness.
Methods A cohort study of 150 patients >18 years with severe sepsis
according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, in an ICU of a university
hospital. Demographic, clinical parameters and coagulation, infection
and inflammation parameters during the first 24 hours from severe
sepsis or septic shock onset were studied. Descriptive and comparative
statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA).
Results We analyzed 150 consecutive episodes of severe sepsis (16%)
or septic shock (84%) in the ICU. The median age of the patients was
64 (interquartile range, 48.7 to 71) years; the main sources of infection
were intra-abdomen (45%) and respiratory (38%); 70.7% had medical
diseases. The 28-day mortality was 22.7%. The profile of death patients
were men (64.7%, n =22), with significantly higher average age (63 vs.
57 years; P= 0.049), as well as clinical severity scores, APACHE II (29.8 vs.
24.1; P <0.001) and SOFA (12.1 vs. 8.9; P <0.001) and major dysfunction
organ number (4.6 vs. 3.6; P <0.001). Bilirubin was the best predictor of
28-day mortality with the largest AUC (0.71), followed by hemoglobin
(0.69) and C3 (0.67). The multivariate logistic regression was adjusted
for three risk parameters, hemoglobin (OR: 0.68; 95% Cl: 0.51 to 0.94),
bilirubin (OR:1.63; 95% Cl: 1.08 to 2.45) and white blood cells (OR:1.04;
95% Cl: 1.01 to 1.08) and with these parameters a ROC analysis was
performed, giving an AUC of 0.77 (0.69 to 0.84).
Conclusion The assessment of routine biomarkers (bilirubin, white
blood cells and hemoglobin) may be a helpful tool in the decision-
making process at the bedside, for the evaluation of early ICU admission
of recoverable patients, as indicators of inflammatory response, organ
dysfunction or catabolism level, and their significant predictive value
on mortality.

Introduction We analyze procalcitonin (PCT) as a prognostic marker, in
order to assess the clinical impact of a daily PCT measure.

$11

Methods From November 2010 to November 2011 we collected clinical
data, drug administration, scores and PCT values of 420 consecutive
patients during hospitalization. Statistical analysis was made using
SPSS software. We calculated ICU mortality, 1-month mortality and
1-year mortality. Median percentage daily variation was calculated as:
(PCT day after — PCT of the date value) / PCT of the date valuex100.
PCT variation in the last 48 hours of hospitalization was calculated as:
(PCT at discharge - PCT at 48 hours before discharge) / PCT 48 hours
before dischargex100. We compared peak values in dead patients
versus alive patients. A logistic regression was performed in order to
assess mortality odds ratio.
Results Of the 420 patients, 63 (15%) died in the ICU, 12 (2.86%) died
1 month after ICU discharge and 16 (3.80%) died 1 year after ICU
discharge. PCT values were higher during the last day of hospitalization
in dead patients versus alive patients. PCT percentage variation during
the last 48 hours of hospitalization had a slower trend in patients who
died than in those who survived; these differences are even more
marked in patients who had a septic event. A slower descending trend
of daily PCT values was found in patients who died than in those who
survived. PCT peak levels during the ICU stay were higher in dead
patients with respect to alive ones. At logistic regression analysis PCT
decrease in the last 48 hours <-30% (OR 3.71), PCT peak higher than
10 ng/ml (OR 2.38), and PCT last day/PCT peak ratio >50% (OR 2.064)
were ICU mortality risk factors. PCT values were a higher predictive ICU
mortality risk factor than SOFA and APACHE II scores. Other prognostic
factors were age and lactate values. Only age was a risk factor in
1-month and 1-year mortality.
Conclusion PCT is a good prognostic marker and is strongly correlated
to the clinical status and gravity of the patients, so PCT seems to be a
useful marker in an intensive care scenario.

Changes in circulating procalcitonin versus C-reactive protein in
predicting evolution of infectious disease in febrile, critically ill
patients

'VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Erasmus
Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P30 (doi: 10.1186/cc11968)

Introduction Although absolute values for C-reactive protein (CRP) and
procalcitonin (PCT) are well known to predict sepsis in the critically ill, it
remains unclear if and how changes in CRP and PCT predict evolution
of infectious disease and how they compare in this respect.

Methods In 72 critically ill patients with new-onset fever, CRP and
PCT were measured on day 0, 1, 2 and 7 after inclusion, and their
clinical course was documented over 1 week with follow-up to day 28.
Infection was microbiologically defined, as was bloodstream infection;
septic shock was defined as infection plus shock.

Results From peak at day 0 to 2 to day 7, CRP decreases most when
(bloodstream) infection and septic shock (day 0 to 2) resolve and
increases most when complications such as a new (bloodstream)
infection or septic shock (day 3 to 7) supervene (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve 0.70 or higher, P = 0.04 or lower). PCT
decreases most when septic shock resolves (AUC 0.72, P = 0.007) and
increases most when a new bloodstream infection or septic shock
supervenes (AUC 0.82 or higher, P <0.001). The day 7 value of PCT rather
than of CRP was predictive for 28-day outcome (AUC 0.70, P = 0.005).
Conclusion The data, obtained during ICU-acquired fever and infections,
suggest that CRP and PCT changes predict the course of infectious
disease and its complications. CRP may be favoured over PCT courses
in decisions on appropriateness and duration of antibiotic treatment,
whereas PCT rather than CRP courses may help predicting complications
such as bloodstream infection, septic shock and mortality.

Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy in patients with congestive
heart failure and suspicion of lower respiratory tract infection:
results from a randomized trial

Introduction Differentiation of acute heart failure from infection in
patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of congestive heart
failure (CHF) is challenging due to overlap of clinical symptoms and
X-ray findings. The BACH study found higher mortality rates if patients
presenting with dyspnea were treated with antibiotics and their
procalcitonin (PCT) levels were low indicating absence of bacterial
infection. Yet the BACH study was observational and causal inference
cannot be drawn. Herein, we analyzed the effects of PCT-guided
antibiotic stewardship in CHF patients from a previous trial (ProHOSP).
Methods This is a secondary analysis of a previous randomized trial
of adult ED patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of CHF.
Patients were randomized to administration of antibiotics based on a
PCT algorithm (PCT group) or standard guidelines without knowledge
of PCT levels (control group). The primary endpoint of this analysis is
the risk of adverse outcome defined as death or ICU admission within
30 days after ED admission.

Results A total of 233 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 116 in
the PCT-guided group and 117 in the control group. In the subgroup
of patients with low initial PCT levels <0.25 ng/I (n = 110), PCT-guided
patients had a significant reduction in antibiotic exposure (mean 3.7
vs. 6.5 days, difference —2.8 (95% Cl -4.4, -1.2), P <0.001). Furthermore,
PCT-guided patients had a significant lower risk for death and ICU
admission (4% vs. 20%, odds ratio 6.0 (1.3, 28.2), P= 0.02). See Figure 1.
Conclusion In CHF patients with suspicion of respiratory infection,
use of a PCT protocol resulted in a significant decrease of antibiotic
exposure and significantly improved outcomes in patients with low PCT
levels indicating absence of bacterial infection. Whether inadequate
antibiotic therapy in these CHF patients requiring diuretic treatment
explains this difference in clinical outcomes needs verification.

Introduction Pulmonary complications after cardiac surgery like ARDS
are frequent and linked to high mortality [1]. Pro-adrenomedullin
(pro-ADM) has a possible role in the development of ARDS [2] and a
positive correlation between levels of pro-ADM and inflammation
was found [3]. In this study we investigated whether intraoperative
and postoperative pro-ADM transpulmonary gradient could predict
postoperative morbidity.

Methods In this prospective cohort study, 39 patients undergoing
cardiac surgery using CPB were included. Blood was collected before
surgery (TO), after induction of anesthesia (T1), after termination of CPB
(T2), at ICU arrival (T3) and 3 hours (T4), 6 hours (T5) and 18 hours (T6)
after arrival. Proo-ADM was measured with a sandwich immunoassay.
Primary endpoints were length of ICU and hospital stay (ICU-LOS,
hospital-LOS).

Results An increase of arterial and venous pro-ADM plasma _ con-
centrations was observed after surgery. Immediately after termination of
CPB the venous concentration was significantly lower than arterial pro-
ADM concentration, but at T6 the venous concentration was significantly
higher, indicating a switch from a negative to positive transpulmonary
gradient (Figure 1). The pro-ADM venous-arterial difference at T5 was a
significant predictor of ICU-LOS (P = 0.032) and the difference at T3 was a
significant predictor of hospital-LOS (P = 0.001).

Conclusion We found that the transpulmonary gradient of pro-ADM
was a predictor for ICU-LOS and hospital-LOS at T3 and T5, respectively.
Pro-ADM might be a promising marker for prediction on outcome of
patients undergoing cardiac surgery on CPB. The transpulmonary shift
of pro-ADM might be caused by an inflammatory response.

P <0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was significant. P = 0.0017 for
patients with pADM <1.2 nmol/l. Cox regression analysis also showed
statistical significance (P = 0.0033) and a likelihood ratio = 1.18 per each
1 nmol/l increase in pADM.
Conclusion The protein pADM is an important prognostic biomarker
of survival when measured on admission of septic patients to the ICU.

Introduction IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine, is synthesized from fibro-
blasts, T lymphocytes, endothelial cells and monocytes. It serves as an
important mediator during the acute phase response to inflammation in
sepsis. We hypothesized that the plasma IL-6 is correlated with mortality
and severity scores in critically ill patients with sepsis.

Methods We conducted a prospective study of plasma IL-6 level at the
initial phase of sepsis and the risk of mortality. A total of 203 patients
with sepsis, who were admitted to the medical ICU at Phramongkutklao
Hospital, Bangkok during January to December 2011, were analyzed.
Serum IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate were measured within
the first 24 hours of ICU admission. Severity scores (APACHE II, SAP II,
and SOFA scores) were measured. The primary outcome variable was
28-day all-cause mortality.

Results We found that the overall 28-day mortality was 46% (93 out of 203
patients). There was a significantly positive correlation between mortality
rate and plasma IL-6 (survivors vs. nonsurvivors; 74 (4.4 to 1,718) vs. 206
(19 to 5,000) pg/ml, P <0.05), lactate (survivors vs. nonsurvivors; 1.65 (0.7
to 11.61) vs. 2.47 (0.94 to 19.13) mmol/l, P <0.05), but not CRP levels (P =
0.24). Compared with the patients with plasma IL-6 <100 pg/ml, septic
patients with IL-6 levels >100 were associated with an increased 28-day
mortality with the odd ratio of 2.99 (95% Cl 1.42 to 6.29, P <0.05). We
also found that plasma IL-6 levels were well correlated with APACHE II
(P <0.05), SAPS II (P <0.05), and SOFA (P <0.05) scores.

Conclusion The initial phase plasma IL-6 levels were correlated with
severity and mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis.

Introduction Sepsis results from complex interactions between
infecting microorganisms and host responses, often leading to
multiple organ failures and death. Over the years, its treatment has

$13

been standardized in early goal-oriented therapies, which may benefit
from circulating biomarkers for early risk stratification. We aimed to
evaluate the prognostic value of presepsin (sCD14-ST), a novel marker
of bacterial infection.

Methods We performed a nested case-control study from the
randomized controlled Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis (ALBIOS)
trial, enrolling patients with severe sepsis or septic shock from 100
ICUs in Italy. Fifty survivors and 50 nonsurvivors at ICU discharge
were selected, matched for age, sex, center and time of enrollment
after inclusion criteria were present. EDTA-plasma samples were
collected at days 1, 2 and 7 after enrolment for presepsin (immune-
chemiluminescence assay PATHFAST Presepsin, URL 320 pg/ml, CV 5%;
Mitsubishi Chemicals) and procalcitonin assay (PCT, Elecsys BRAHMS
Cobas® PCT, URL 0.046 ng/ml, CV 8.8%; Roche Diagnostics).

Results Clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups,
except for a worse SOFA score at day 1 in decedents. Presepsin at
day 1 was significantly higher in decedents (2,268 (1,145 to 4,305) pg/
ml, median (Q1 to Q3)) than in survivors (1,184 (855 to 2,158) pg/ml,
P = 0.001), while PCT did not differ (18.5 (3.3 to 45.7) vs. 10.8 (2.6 to
46.4) ng/ml, P = 0.31). Presepsin decreased over time in survivors, but
remained elevated in decedents (974 (674 to 1,927) vs. 2,551 (1,438
to 5,624) pg/ml at day 7, P = 0.02 for time-survival interaction); PCT
decreased similarly in the two groups (P = 0.19). Patients with early
elevated presepsin had worse SOFA score, higher number of MOFs,
hemodynamic instability (lower mean arterial pressure at baseline
and after 6 hours), and mortality rate at 90 days (75% vs. 42%, log-
rank P <0.001). The association between presepsin and outcome was
more marked in patients with late enrollment (6 to 24 hours), and in
septic shock. Early presepsin had better prognostic accuracy than PCT
(AUROC 0.69 vs. 0.56, P= 0.07), and improved discrimination over SOFA
score, especially in septic shock.

Conclusion Early presepsin measurements may provide important
prognostic information in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock,
and may be of crucial importance for early risk stratification.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P36 (doi: 10.1186/cc11974)

Introduction The level of presepsin is useful for differentiating sepsis
from noninfectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome. It has
been reported that the presepsin levels in patients with chronic renal
failure are abnormally high. However, there are no studies investigating
the usefulness of presepsin for diagnosis of sepsis in patients with acute
kidney injury (AKI). Our purpose of this study is to clarify the diagnostic
accuracy of presepsin in patients with AKI and the relationship between
presepsin level and AKI severity.

Methods This study was conducted as a single-center retrospective
study. Blood samples were collected from patients admitted to the
emergency room at Fukuoka University Hospital between June 2010
and October 2012. We enrolled 254 patients with suspected sepsis and
other disease patients. We classified the patients into an AKI group
according to the RIFLE criteria (Risk n = 52, Injury n = 39, Failure n = 41,
Loss of kidney function and End-stage kidney disease n = 7) and a non-
AKI group (n = 115). The AKI patient group was further classified into a
sepsis group and a nonsepsis group in each AKI stage and we analyzed
the diagnostic accuracy of presepsin in patients with sepsis.

Results For the non-AKI patients, the median of presepsin in patients
with nonsepsis (n = 78) and the sepsis group (n = 37) were 406 pg/ml
(range: 86 to 4,374) and 1,065 pg/ml (range 86 to 9,960), respectively
(P <0.0001). For the Risk patients, the median of presepsin in patients
with nonsepsis (n = 25) and the sepsis group (n = 27) were 299 pg/ml
(range: 71.2 to 3,361) and 831 pg/ml (range: 233 to 16,759), respectively
(P <0.01). For the Injury patients, the median of presepsin in patients
with nonsepsis (n = 12) and the sepsis group (n = 27) were 463 pg/ml
(range: 122 to 1,197) and 1,451 pg/ml (range: 237 to 4,200), respectively
(P <0.001). For the Failure patients, the median of presepsin in patients

with nonsepsis (n = 14) and the sepsis group (n = 27) were 1,607 pg/ml
(range: 454 to 8,516) and 1,523 pg/ml (range: 293 to 16,764), respectively
(P= 0.175). The diagnostic accuracy of presepsin in patients with sepsis
was determined by ROC analysis, the area under the curve was 0.789
for the non-AKI patient group, 0.735 for the Risk patient group, 0.855 for
the Injury patient group and 0.593 for the Failure patient group.
Conclusion In Failure and more progressed AKI patients, the diagnostic
accuracy of the presepsin level was lower than the other groups.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P37 (doi: 10.1186/cc11975)

Introduction As a method for the diagnosis of sepsis, we previously
reported an ELISA method for measuring the serum levels of presepsin.
That method, however, took approximately 2 hours to yield results.
Methods To resolve this problem, we later developed a simplified
assay kit making use of immunochromatography (Point of Care test;
POC test), and are currently evaluating the usefulness of this kit for
diagnosis of sepsis and evaluation of its severity. In 21 septic patients
with sepsis, we analyzed the serum levels of presepsin in relation to
APACHE II and SOFA scores.

Results APACHE II and SOFA scores at baseline were 28.7 + 7.5 and
10.8 + 3.9, respectively, in these patients. These were significant
correlations between the serum presepsin levels and the APACHE II
score, and also between the serum presepsin levels and the SOFA score.
Conclusion Furthermore, there was also a significant correlation
between the results of the POC test and the serum presepsin levels.
These results indicate that measurement of the serum presepsin might
be useful for evaluating the severity of sepsis.

Introduction Serum nitrite/nitrate (NOx) levels in the early phase of
septic acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) have recently been reported to possibly play a key role in
pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS.

Methods NOx levels in the early phase of septic ALI/ARDS were
measured by autoanalyzer (TCI-NOX 1000; Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd,
Tokyo, Japan). Cytokine was measured by ELISA (Medogenix, Fleurus,
Belgium).

Results Both NOx and TNFa levels were significantly higher in the ARDS
group than in the ALI group. A negative correlation was found between
the PaO,/FIO, (P/F) ratio and serum NOx levels. In addition, a positive
correlation was found between the TNFa and serum NOx levels. The
30-day, 60-day and 90-day mortality rates were 8.7%, 15.2% and 19.6%,
respectively, in the patients with ALI/ARDS. There were no differences
in the P/F ratio, serum NOx levels or TNFa levels in the early phase
of ALI/ARDS between the 30-day survival and death groups. On the
other hand, the P/F ratio, serum NOx levels and TNFa levels in the early
phase of ALI/ARDS were significantly higher in the 60-day and 90-day
death groups than in the corresponding survival groups. There were
no significant differences in the 90-day mortality rates between the ALI
and ARDS groups.

Conclusion Our findings suggested that NOx may be involved in the
pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS.

Introduction Ruling out Legionella sp. in patients presenting with
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is important due to differences
in treatment regimens. Yet antigen tests as well as blood cultures have
low sensitivity and an important time delay, making empirical broad
spectrum coverage necessary particularly in severe cases. Fiumefreddo
and colleagues recently proposed a clinical score based on six clinical
and laboratory variables (fever, cough, sodium, lactate-dehydrogenase,
C-reactive protein, platelet count) which allowed assessing the
likelihood of Legionella [1]. Yet these variables need validation in
an independent patient cohort before implementation into clinical
routine.
Methods We analyzed data from a large multinational database of
patients with CAP (CAPO) [2] between 2001 and 2012. We performed
logistic regression analysis and the area under the receiver operating
characteristics (AUC) curve to study the association of these variables
with the diagnosis of Legionella.
Results Data for 8,278 CAP patients were analysed; the infectious
organism was known in 2,321 cases (28%), including a total of 101
patients with urinary antigen-confirmed Legionnaires’ disease and
983 patients with confirmed pneumococcal disease. All variables were
predictors for Legionella with odds ratios ranging from 1.002 to 5.767.
Combining the variables in a joint logistic regression model showed a
high predictive accuracy with an AUC of 0.86.
Conclusion This analysis validates the Legionella score in an inde-
pendent sample and shows high diagnostic accuracy. Interventional
trials with adapted antibiotic regimes for non-inferiority in a real live
population are warranted.

Introduction It has been shown that polymorphic variants at some
host genes can modify risk of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP),
including those critical for the host response to CAP — innate immune
system, the lung’s defense against inhaled microorganisms, and
inhibition of fibrinolysis and the renin—angiotensin system. The aim of
the study was to analyze polymorphisms in genes potentially relevant
to CAP pathogenesis mechanisms to reveal novel and confirm reported
genetic risk factors in the general Russian population.

Methods Patients with CAP (n = 334), volunteers without a previous
history of CAP, control group A (n = 141) and a second control
group B (n = 314) were included in the study. Using allele-specific
tetraprimer PCR, all subjects were genotyped for 13 polymorphic
variants in the genes of xenobiotic detoxification CYP1A1 (rs2606345,
rs4646903, 1rs1048943), GSTM1 (Ins/Del), GSTT1 (Ins/Del), ABCB1
(rs1045642); immune and inflammation response IL-6 (rs1800795),
TNFa (rs1800629), MBL2 (rs7096206), CCR5 (rs333), NOS3 (rs1799983),
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; rs4340), and occlusive vascular
disease/hyperhomocysteinemia MTHFR (rs1801 133).

Results Seven genes CYP1A1 1rs2606345T/T, GSTM1 Ins/*, ABCB1
C/C, IL-6 C/C-G/G, NOS3 T/T-G/G, CCR5 Ins/Ins, and ACE Del/Del were
associated with CAP. The highest effect was detected for the CYP1A1
rs2606345: in comparison with the control A, P = 3.9x10°, OR =
2.40, 95% Cl: 1.59 to 3.64; and in comparison with the control B, P =
1.4X10°, OR = 2.0, 95% Cl: 1.46 to 2.74. For the two genes CYP1A1 and
GSTM1, associations remained significant after correction for multiple
comparisons. Multiple analysis by the number of all risk genotypes
showed a highly significant association with CAP (P = 2.4x10°, OR =
3.03, 95% Cl 1.98 to 4.64) with the threshold for three risk genotypes.
Using the ROC analysis, the AUC value for multi-locus model was
estimated as 68.38, which is rather high for genetic markers.
Conclusion We have provided the first experimental evidence for the
associations of genes coding detoxification enzymes with the risk of
CAP. Our results also demonstrate that predisposition to CAP is strongly
attributed to the effects of a number of genes with low penetrance
and therefore imply that inter-locus interactions may be regarded as
an important component of polygenic and multifactorial factors of
susceptibility to CAP.

Introduction Several comorbidities have been independently asso-
ciated with both predisposition to community-acquired pneumonia
and a worse outcome. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact
of comorbidities on the outcome of patients with severe community-
acquired pneumonia (SCAP).

Methods A prospective, multicentre, observational cohort study of
all patients with SCAP consecutively admitted to 14 Portuguese ICUs
during a 12-month period. Several comorbidities were evaluated:
congestive heart failure, cancer, chronic renal failure, chronic respira-
tory failure, chronic hepatic disease, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus,
neurologic disease, immunosuppression, HIV infection. To evaluate the
impact of comorbidities associated with hospital mortality in univariate
analysis, a logistic regression analysis adjusted to other variables
(clinical relevant or statistically significant in univariate analysis) was
performed.

Results A total of 536 (14%) of the 3,766 enrolled patients had SCAP.
They were mostly male (66%) with median age 59 (29 to 82) years,
median SAPS II 44 (21 to 80) and total SOFA score 8 (3 to 16). Thirty-
seven per cent of the cases were microbiologically documented (St.
pneumoniae — 24%; Enterobacteriaceae —- 20%; influenza A (H1N1)
virus — 18%) and 45% had septic shock. Antibiotic combination was
used in 76% of the patients and 61% received a macrolide. Median
hospital length of stay was 19 (3 to 70) days and hospital mortality
was 35%. Comorbidities were present in 70% of the patients. The most
frequent were: diabetes mellitus (21%), chronic respiratory failure
(18%) and alcoholism (15%). Median Charlson’s comorbidity index
(CCI) was 4 (0 to 13). In univariate analysis, the presence of at least one
comorbidity (odds ratio (OR) 2.29; 95% Cl 1.49 to 3.52), namely cancer
(OR 3.80; 95% Cl 2.14 to 6.74; P <0.001), chronic renal failure (OR 3.23;
95% Cl 1.53 to 6.82; P = 0.001), immunosuppression (OR 2.12; 95% Cl
1.15 to 3.92; P= 0.014) and neurologic disease (OR 1.87; 95% Cl 1.10 to
3.17; P = 0.02), increased the chances of dying in the hospital. Median
CCI was also significantly higher in nonsurvivors (5 vs. 3; P <0.001; OR
per point 1.10 (95% Cl: 1.05 to 1.15)). The only independent risk factor
for hospital mortality was the presence of at least one comorbidity (OR
2.09; 95% Cl 1.13 to 3.85).

Conclusion In SCAP, the presence of at least one comorbidity doubles
the chances of dying in the hospital and is an independent risk factor
for hospital mortality.

Introduction Infective endocarditis (IE) is a high-mortality disease,
especially in the early surgery subgroup. The aim of this study was try
to identify prognostic factors of IE that will require surgery during the
same admission of their diagnosis, including evaluation of surgical
severity scores.

Methods A retrospective study (5 years) of all patients admitted to
a tertiary hospital in northern Spain with diagnosis of IE (modified
Duke criteria) who required early surgery. Demographic, clinical and
microbiology data were collected. Chi-square and Student t tests.
Significance: P <0.05. SPSS17.

Results We had 73 patients, 79.5% men, age 65 years. Eighty-two
percent had positive blood cultures. Forty-one percent of cases
required previous ICU admission. Surgery was urgent in 35%. Fifty-six
per cent of patients had postoperative shock and 58% suffered post-
surgery ARF. Hospital mortality was 31.5%. Regarding prognostic scales:
the mean EuroSCORE was 11.38 + 3.93 points. No patient was placed in
the low-risk group. Ninety-four per cent of cases were at high risk. The
Parsonnet mean score was 27.7 + 11.6. The mean Beth Israel Medical
Center was 37.6 + 10 points. The mean Ontario scale was 7.09 + 2.7. The
mean Surgical risk scale of Roques was 6.69. And the mean by Pons
Scale was 24.02. Dead patients are older, with previous heart disease,
require urgent surgery and have previous ICU stay; usually they have
MOF and they had received less than 7 days of antibiotic treatment. The
etiology did not worsen the prognosis.

Conclusion In early surgery IE, it appears to be associated with mortality:
age >70 years, previous heart disease, emergency surgery, antibiotics
within 7 days before surgery, preoperative MOF, and high scores on
scales of Pons and Ontario. The causal agent and echocardiography
have no relation with worse prognosis. The general syndrome debut
and the Streptococcus spp. etiology seem to have lower mortality. IE
has pathologies with high .preoperative severity scores but these are
not sufficient to guide therapeutic decisions.

Effectiveness of early ureteric stenting for urosepsis associated with
urinary tract calculi

'Shonan Kamakura General Hospital, Kamakura, Japan; *Mito Kyodo General
Hospital, Mito, Japan

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P43 (doi: 10.1186/cc11981)

Introduction Urosepsis associated with urinary tract calculi is a critical
disease. Patients with this condition occasionally require drainage,
mostly ureteric stent placement and these patients need longer
hospitalization. However, indications for timely ureteric stenting for
urosepsis associated with urinary tract calculi have not been clearly
determined. The objective of the study was to evaluate whether earlier
stent placement might lead to shorter length of stay (LOS) in hospitals.
Methods For patients who required ureteric stent procedures for
urosepsis associated with urinary tract calculi in our hospital from
July 2008 to July 2012, we compared the LOS in our hospital between
patients with earlier stenting and those without it. A linear regression
model was used for multivariable-adjusted comparison.

Results In a total of 30 patients (mean age, 72; 13 males), the mean
days from emergency room admission to ureteric stenting was 3.5 days
(range, 1 to 14 days) and the overall mean LOS was 36 days (range,
8 to 102 days). The early-stenting group (mean LOS, 21 days) had
significantly shorter LOS than the delayed-stenting group (mean LOS,
50 days) with adjusted 8 coefficient of -26 days (95% Cl, —46, -6).
Conclusion In patients with urosepsis associated with urinary tract calculi,
earlier stenting within 2 days of admission may reduce the hospital LOS.

Introduction Analysis of mortality-related factors in urinary sepsis
patients.
Methods A retrospective descriptive study of urologic sepsis patients
in the ICU from 2008 to 2010. Clinical, epidemiological and outcome
variables were analysed. Quantitative variables are expressed as
either mean and standard deviation or as median and interquartile
range for asymmetric variables. Qualitative variables are expressed as
percentages and absolute values. Mann—Whitney’s U test and Fisher's
exact test were applied (a error was 5% in both cases), as well as binary
logistic regression for multivariate analysis.
Results There was a total number of 44 patients (aged 59.39 + 17.71;
63.8% females). APACHE II score upon admission was 18 + 6. Out of
these patients, 27.3% showed no underlying disorder and 18.2% (no =
8) showed chronic renal failure; 25% were immunodepressed patients;
31% underwent urinary instrumentation in the previous 15 days, yet
only three of them had undergone permanent urine catheterization.
Observed mortality was 25%, while sepsis-related mortality was 22.7%.
The patients who died were, on average, older that those who survived
(67.9 +7 10.2 vs. 56.8 + 18.7; P= 0.02). Besides, the former also reported
greater delay in turning to the hospital after symptom onset (13.4 + 6.6
vs. 6.2 + 4.7 days; P = 0.0001). Immunodepressed patients presented
higher mortality rate: OR 8.7 (95% Cl 1.7 to 42.3), as well as those who
underwent inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment: OR 10.8 (95%
Cl 2.1 to 54.7). No relation was observed between germ typology or
resistance to B-lactam antibiotics and mortality. After adjustment of
mortality due to APACHE II score upon admission, delay in the onset
of appropriate antibiotic treatment was an independent predictor of
mortality in our patients: OR 1.2, 95% Cl (1.02 to 1.42).
Conclusion Urinary sepsis mortality is associated with late-onset and/
or inappropriate antibiotic use, as well as with immunodepression and
advanced age.

Introduction Infections are a major complication during the
postoperative period after heart transplantation (HT). In our hospital,
nosocomial pneumonia is the most frequent infection in this period.
The objective of this study is to determine the epidemiological and
microbiological characteristics of this disease in our centre.

Methods A descriptive retrospective study of all medical records of HT
performed in a single institution from 1991 to 2009 followed until June
2010. Clinical and microbiological variables were considered. Centre
for Diseases Control (CDC) criteria were used to define nosocomial
infections. Invasive aspergillosis was considered if there were criteria
for probable aspergillosis according to IDSA criteria.

Results In 594 HTs there were 97 infectious episodes in 75 patients
(12.6%). Eighty-five patients (14.3%) died during hospitalization.
Infection is the second cause of mortality during the postoperative
period (17.9% of dead patients). The most common locations of
infections were pneumonia (n = 31, 31.9% of infection episodes),
bloodstream (n = 24, 24.7%), urinary tract (n = 14, 14.4%), surgical site

S16

(n = 13, 13.4%) and intraabdominal infections (n = 13, 13.4%). Patients
with pneumonia were treated according to knowledge in a specific
moment, thus different antibiotics were used. The duration of antibiotic
therapy was 20 + 15.5 days. In nine episodes of pneumonia according
to the CDC no germ was isolated in the cultures. Six of the episodes
were polymicrobial infections. The most frequent microbes isolated
were EF. coli (n = 7, 22.5% of pneumonia cases), A. fumigatus (n = 7,
22.5%), S. aureus (n = 3, 9.68%), P. aeruginosa (n = 3, 9.68%), P. mirabilis,
K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. faecalis, C. glabrata, and S. marcescens (one
case each, 3.22%). Pheumonia was suspected but not confirmed in 75
patients. Despite this, antibiotic treatment was maintained for a media
of 17.35 + 7.01 days: 56 wide-spectrum treatments and 18 targeted
therapy after knowing the antibiogram. The length of ICU stay was
38.4 + 70.8 (3 to 264) days, of hospital stay was 66.2 + 80.5 (3 to 304)
days and of mechanical ventilation was 27.3 + 50.2 (3 to 264) days. The
mortality of patients with pneumonia was 32.3%.

Conclusion Nosocomial pneumonia is the most frequent infection
in our series. Despite when infection was not confirmed, antibiotic
therapy was maintained in suspect cases. We found a high incidence of
aspergillosis. Limitations because of wide duration of this study should
be considered.

Introduction Despite many therapeutic interventions, ventilator-
acquired pneumonias (VAP) are frequent in the ICU and are associated
with major morbidity and mortality. Sepsis causes a time-dependent
modification of the inflammatory response. This reprogramming
could promote the occurrence of a secondary infection and worsen
the prognosis. In animals, peritonitis is associated with an alteration
of pulmonary immunity and an increasing mortality from secondary
pneumonia.

Methods To investigate, in humans, the potential involvement of
previous intra-abdominal infection (IIA) in preventing or promoting
VAP, we realized a prospective observational study using data from a
multicenter database (OUTCOMEREA), including all patients admitted

to the ICU for severe sepsis or septic shock who required mechanical
ventilation for at least 72 hours.

Results In total, 2,623 patients were included, of which 290 had an
IIA. A total of 862 patients (33%) developed a VAP, 56 (19%) in the IIA
group and 806 (34%) in the non-llA group (P <0.01). VAP, after sepsis,
occurred less frequently and later in patients with IIA. The occurrence of
IIA, in comparison with another sepsis, is a protective factor against VAP
(HR = 0.643 (0.478 to 0.863), P = 0.003). There is, however, no significant
difference between the groups in terms of ICU mortality (28% vs. 32%,
P=0.16). See Figures 1 and 2.

Conclusion In this study, the presence of an abdominal sepsis, in a
context of severe sepsis or septic shock, was associated with a lower
incidence of later VAP. These results have to be confirmed in other
studies, especially prospective. They open interesting new research
directions.

Incidence and risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia in
Siriraj Hospital

O Chaiwat, S Nakaviroj

Siriraj Hospital Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P47 (doi: 10.1186/cc11985)

Introduction Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a serious illness
with substantial morbidity and mortality and increases the cost of
hospital care. Even when bundles of care to prevent VAP have been
implemented, the incidence of VAP was not dramatically improved.
This study aims to determine the incidence and risk factors of VAP in
the SICU of Siriraj Hospital.

Methods During a 1-year period, 228 patients admitted to the SICU
were enrolled. All patients required ventilatory support longer than
48 hours. Data were collected by reviewing patient medical records
including demographic data, onset of VAP, type of organisms,
medication used, number of central venous catheters (CVC) used and
blood transfusion. VAP outcomes were also reported.

Results VAP occurred in 21 patients (9.21%) or 8.21 per 1,000 ventilator-
days. The onset of VAP was late in the majority of patients. The most
common organism was A. baumannii (66%), followed by P. gaeuruginosa
(19%). Compared with non-VAP groups, patients in the VAP group had
higher APACHE II score (18 vs. 13, P <0.001), blood transfusion (95% vs.
75%, P= 0.04), numbers of CVC used (3 vs. 1, P <0.001), muscle relaxant
used (43% vs. 3%, P <0.001) and steroid used (33% vs. 4%, P <0.001).
The VAP group also had a significantly higher number of intubation,
reintubation and self-extubation. Multiple logistic regression showed

S17

that numbers of CVC, intubation and surgery, the use of muscle
relaxant and steroid were independent risk factors for developing VAP.
Ventilator days and ICU length of stay were longer in the VAP group
(25 vs. 6 and 25 vs. 7 days, respectively). Lastly, the hospital mortality
rate was significantly higher in the VAP group (33% vs. 12%, P = 0.008).
Conclusion The incidence of VAP was 9.2% in the SICU of Siriraj Hospital,
which was comparable with previous reports. Bundles of care to
prevent VAP should include weaning from a ventilator. Muscle relaxant
and steroid should be administered according to strong indication.
Meticulous care of the airway should be implemented as protocol in
order to prevent complications that can result in the development of
VAP.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P48 (doi: 10.1186/cc11986)

Introduction This is a 1-year prospective study to determine the
incidence, source and etiology of hospital-acquired bloodstream
infection (HABSI) in the Indian context. The resistance pattern was also
reviewed.

Methods A single-centre prospective study in a 35-bed ICU. HABSI
was defined according to current CDC guidelines. HCAP, catheter-
associated UTI (CAUTI) and skin-related infections causing BSI was also
defined according to recent guidelines and analysed.

Results Out of 332 positive samples, 90 samples (n = 45) were HABSI.
The microbiological analysis showed 60% were Gram-negative, 6%
were candida and 27% were Gram-positive. The commonest isolate
was klebsiella and MRSA was commonest in Gram-positive. The source
of HABSI showed CRBSI was the commonest cause at 69%, which
correlates with international data. Ventilator-associated pneumonia
and CAUTI caused 9.5% BSI respectively. The resistance pattern among
Gram-negative bacteria showed multidrug-resistant (MDR) and
extreme drug-resistant (XDR) isolates were highest. See Tables 1 and 2.

Conclusion The incidence of HABSI is 27%. Of this, CRBSI cause 70%
and Gram-negative bacteria were commonest with high resistance.
This is in contrast to western data where Gram-positive infections are
common. Our study highlights need for stringent guidelines for CRBSI
prevention.

Risk factors for catheter-related bloodstream infections in a surgical
ICU

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P49 (doi: 10.1186/cc11987)

Introduction Preventing catheter-related bloodstream _ infections
(CR-BSI) can reduce the duration of hospital stay, healthcare costs, and
mortality rates. Identifying the risk factors and correction of modifiable
factors should be one of the main objectives of infection control
measures. The aim of this study is to determine the risk factors of CR-BSI
in a cohort of surgical ICU patients admitted to Baskent University
Hospital.
Methods Following Institutional Review Board approval, data for 876
patients admitted to the surgical ICU between January 2009 and July
2012 were reviewed retrospectively. After completing the review, 25
patients diagnosed with CR-BSI were compared with 66 appropriate
matches who did not have CR-BSI. Demographical features, underlying
diseases, APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation)
and SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) scores, length of stay,
organ dysfunctions, laboratory values, use of vasopressors, mechanical
ventilation, nutrition, antibiotics, transfusions, and features related to
central venous catheterization were recorded. Patients who did not
have a central venous catheter and were discharged within 2 days of
ICU stay were excluded.
Results Out of 91 patients included in the final analysis, 25 (27%)
patients had CR-BSI. When compared with patients who did not have
CR-BSI, those who did were older (P = 0.029), required more blood
product transfusions during the first 3 days of ICU (P = 0.016), had a
longer duration of catheter stay (P = 0.019), and were more frequently
catheterized via the internal jugular vein (JV) (P = 0.022). A logistic
regression model revealed that advanced age (OR: 1.037; 95% Cl: 1.001
to 1.073; P= 0.042) was an independent risk factor for CR-BSI. Fourteen-
day and 28-day mortality rates for CR-BSI were 12% (P= 0.749) and 28%
(P = 0.406), respectively.
Conclusion Although age, blood product transfusion, duration of
catheter stay, and use of IJV were different between patients who did
and did not have CRBSI, advanced age was the only independent risk
factor for CR-BSI. Early suspicion of CR-BSI by the other well-known risk
factors has a substantial effect on the treatment of CR-BSI.

Introduction Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is a
complication of central venous catheters (CVCs) with an attributable
morbidity, mortality and cost [1]. We examined patient risk factors for
CRBSI in an adult parenteral nutrition (PN) population.

Methods The study was carried out in a 525-bed tertiary-referral
teaching hospital over a 14-year study period (1997 to 2010). All in-
patients referred for PN via CVCs were included. Prospectively collected
data were recorded in a specific PN record. The CRBSI audit group met
quarterly to review all sepsis episodes, assigning a diagnostic category
(CRBSI or non-CRBSI). Patient risk factors for development of CRBSI
were examined using a logistic regression model to take account of
the dichotomous nature of the outcome. Odds ratios from a model
incorporating demographic and clinical data were tested for statistical
significance.

$18

Results The study population was 1,961 patients in whom 3,213 CVCs
were utilised over 19,511 CVC days. There were 256 CRBSI episodes in
216 patients. Median (IQR) patient age was 62 (23), and 58% were male.
The incidence of CRBSI decreased significantly (P <0.001) during the
study period from 16% of patients in the period 1997 to 2003 to 7%
in 2004 to 2010. The corresponding rate of CRBSI infection (per 1,000
CVC days) decreased from 18 to 10. There was a significant decrease
(P <0.001) in numbers of CVCs inserted per patient (from 1.87 to
1.49). Each extra CVC PN day was associated with an increased risk of
developing CRBSI of 3.4% (OR 1.034, P <0.05). The number of PN CVCs
was associated with developing CRBSI (OR 1.218, P <0.10). Patient
factors significantly associated with CRBSI included perioperative PN
use (compared with medical patients) (OR 2.414, P <0.01), and male sex
(OR 1.952, P <0.01).
Conclusion This prospective study demonstrated that perioperative
PN use was associated with increased risk of CRBSI. The association
between CRBSI and CVC PN days is consistent with the theory
suggesting benefit to limiting CVC duration and changing from PN to
enteral nutrition as soon as appropriate.

Introduction Many patients develop infections following operations.
Decreased immune competence has been demonstrated in
acute neurological conditions. A strong cytokine-mediated anti-
inflammatory response was observed in stroke patients at infection,
although infection due to the decreased proinflammatory mediators
can be expected as well. To investigate this question the following
experiment was performed.

Methods Twenty-two urinary bladder cancer patients with radical
cystectomy and lymphadenectomy were studied. Blood samples were
taken on day 0 (before) and days 1, 3, 6, 9 and 14 after operation as
well as on days 30, 60, 90 and 270 during follow-up. TNFa, soluble TNFa
receptor | and IL-6 levels in sera were determined by HS ELISA and/or
ELISA. Plasma ACTH and cortisol values were measured by RIA kits.
Results From 22 patients, eight deep wound and urine infections
were found in 14 days and six urine and wound infections in 30 days
after surgery, all survived. All patients were bacterially contaminated,
as wound samples taken at the end of operation demonstrated. On
day 0 the circulating TNFa values were lower in infected patients.
TNF started to increase from day 3 to day 9, never reaching values of
the uneventful healing group. Soluble TNF receptor I, IL-6, ACTH, and
cortisol concentrations did not demonstrate any difference on day 0
but from day 1 started to increase transiently, reaching higher levels in
septic patients.

Conclusion A low proinflammatory response is a key facilitating factor
for the development of infection. Measuring serum TNFa levels before
and after operations can thus predict the outcome.

Introduction Although hand hygiene is known as a core element
in prevention of healthcare-associated infections, compliance to
its program is not high. With a new campaign we tried to enlarge
awareness on hand hygiene.

Methods We performed an experimental, before and after, study design
on our 30-bed, mixed medical-surgical ICU. We conducted a baseline

evaluation during 3 days in May 2012 including direct observation of
hand hygiene compliance by control nurses and hand cultures of 50
healthcare workers (HCW). Based on the WHO Guidelines on Hand
Hygiene in Health Care [1], cleaning of hands with alcohol-based hand
rubs (Sterillium) was prescribed before touching a patient and before
aseptic procedures, after body fluid exposure risk and after touching
a patient and touching his/her surroundings. Promotion of the hand
hygiene program consisted of lectures and web-based self-learning,
posters located near points of care and verbal reminders by control
nurses. New observations of hand hygiene by control nurses during
3 days and hand cultures of 50 healthcare providers were performed
in September 2012. Consumption of alcohol-based hand rub (product
volume use per patient-days) was used as a surrogate marker of hand
hygiene over time. The difference in hand hygiene compliance during
the two periods was examined using a chi-squared test. Differences
in hand cultures were examined using a Student's t test. Time trends
in the consumption of alcohol-based hand rub were examined using
linear correlation. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The
study was approved by the institutional Ethics Review Board.

Results During the survey, in May 158 opportunities to observe hand
hygiene were presented and 286 in September. Overall compliance
improved from 34.2% (54/158) to 51% (146/286), x? = 11.7 (P <0.001). In
May, 50 HCW had a mean of 63.20 + 39.37 colony-forming units (CFU)
on their hands compared with 43.0 + 40.19 CFU on the hands of 50
HCW in September (P = 0.024). We also observed an initial increased
use of alcohol-based hand rubs from 21 ml per patient-day in May to
a maximum 72 ml per patient-day in June, but a decline to 44 ml per
patient-day in September, Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.31 (P =
0.61).

Conclusion Implementation of a new hand hygiene program at our ICU
resulted in improved hand hygiene compliance and less CFU on the
hands of HCW. There was no significant increased use of alcohol-based
hand rubs over time. The results indicate that constant awareness is
vital for success.

Introduction ICU-acquired infection is directly related to hospital
mortality. Hand hygiene is an effective, low-cost intervention that
can prevent the spread of bacterial pathogens, including multidrug-
resistant organisms. Historical compliance with hand hygiene
guidelines by physicians, nurses and other care providers is poor.

Methods Present expectations by the Infection Control Committee are
to ‘pump in, pump out’ of every room, using 63% isopropyl alcohol. We
performed 17,622 observations of hand hygiene in the surgical ICU

from March through October 2012, and intervened to change behavior
by providing monthly feedback to specific provider groups and
services. We made use of the Unit Coordinator to measure compliance
of all individuals in the ICU.

Results Overall compliance by physicians was 82.1%, for nonphysicians
was 84.8%. Feedback to physicians, individually and by service,
dramatically increased hand hygiene compliance, defined as both
on entry and exit from the patient room, over the study period. See
Figure 1.

Conclusion Physician behavior is responsive to monthly feedback
that is specific to the individual or surgical service. Use of the Unit
Coordinator was very effective at gathering a very large sample size in
a short period of time.

Introduction The Benefits of Universal Glove and Gowning (BUGG)
study is a cluster-randomized trial to evaluate the use of wearing gloves
and gowns for all patient contact in the ICU. The primary outcome is
VRE and MRSA acquisitions; secondary outcomes include frequency of
healthcare worker visits, infection rates, hand hygiene compliance and
adverse events.

Methods We enrolled 20 ICUs in 15 states. ICUs collected nasal and
perianal swabs on all patients at admission and discharge/transfer.
After a 3-month baseline period, 10 units were randomized to the
intervention arm and required to wear gloves and gowns for all patient
contact. An intervention toolkit was created based on site feedback
and compliance reports. Swab collection compliance was fed back
and discussed during site conference calls on a weekly basis. Site
coordinators monitored compliance with gloves and gowns, hand
hygiene and frequency of HCW visits and reviewed patient charts for
adverse events.

Results During the 12-month study period, 100,210 swabs were
collected. After the baseline period, we were able to achieve and
maintain swab compliance rates between 85 and 97%. Monthly
discharge compliance increased by 21% by the beginning of the
intervention period (Figure 1). Observers found 86% compliance with
universal glove and gowning over 1,242 30-minute observation periods
(Figure 1). Ninety charts at each site were reviewed for adverse events.
Conclusion Over a diverse group of US hospitals, we achieved high
compliance with surveillance cultures and implementing universal
gloving and gowning was achieved quickly with high compliance.

Fighting hospital sepsis

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P55 (doi: 10.1186/cc11993)

Introduction Sepsis accounts for a very high mortality. The Surviving
Sepsis Campaign recommends a first 6 hours resuscitative bundle to
improve patient outcome. Despite this, the bundle is poorly performed
because of several organizational and cultural barriers. In recognition
of this, we guess that an Educational and Organizational Intervention
out of the ICUs could impact on septic patient outcome. In order to
test our hypothesis we carried out, in 12 hospitals, a pre-intervention
survey of the human and organizational resources (HOR) available
in the management of septic patients. The aim is to seek any barrier
potentially affecting correct Guidelines implementation.

Methods Thirty-nine medical wards (MW) and 12 emergency depart-
ments (ED) were enrolled. Every unit was asked to fill in a pre-agreed
HOR Checklist focused on the main requirements suggested by the
Guidelines.

Results Analysing the human resources available, we see that the bed-
to-doctor ratio significantly (P <0.01) increases from the day to the night
shift: from 6 to 43 beds per doctor on the MW (median). Otherwise,
the ED staff remains roughly the same: from 3.5 to 2.5 doctors on duty
(median). The analysis of the organizational tools (Table 1) points out

a low percentage of hospitals having: a Diagnostic and Therapeutic
Protocol for sepsis management (8.3%), some Hospital Empirical
Antibiotic Therapy Guidelines (0%) and an Infective Source Eradication
Protocol (8.3%). Moreover, just 25% of hospitals involve an infectious
diseases expert in every case of severe sepsis or septic shock.
Conclusion We guess that the poor availability of HOR showed by the
hospitals could have a role in the Guidelines implementation and in
the patient's outcome. Only a comparison between these results and
data collected from a Clinical Checklist, focused on sepsis bundle
compliance, and from a patient's outcome summary could confirm our
hypothesis. This is the aim for our next part of the study.

Introduction The incidence of patients carrying ESBL-positive
bacteria in our ICU (12 in 780 admissions in 2011) was not considered
problematic. However, routine cultures had identified ESBL-negative
patients who had become colonized with ESBL strains during their
ICU stay. Self-disinfecting siphons, preventing bacterial growth by
antibacterial coating and intermittent heating, and biofilm formation
by electromechanical vibration, were placed in all sinks in the ICU. The
aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of this intervention.
Methods An intervention study in a 12-bed ICU. The intervention
involved placement of 19 self-disinfecting siphons (Biorec). All patients
with an expected ICU stay of 2 days or more between January 2011
and December 2012 were studied. Samples of throat, soutum and
rectum were taken at admission and twice weekly, and cultured for
ESBLs. Between June 2011 and October 2011, sinks in patient rooms
were cultured regularly for ESBLs. After the intervention in April
2012, multiple repeat cultures were taken. Whenever the species and
antibiogram of bacteria cultured from patients and sinks matched, they
were typed by AFLP.

Results Before intervention Multiple ESBL-forming strains were found in
sinks of all patient rooms. Eighteen patients who were ESBL-negative
on ICU admission became colonized with 11 different ESBL strains,
that were present in sinks of their admission rooms (Figure 1). Four
contaminations were proven by AFLP-tying. One patient died of ESBL-
positive F. cloacae pneumonia. After intervention All sinks were negative
for ESBL strains. No further patients became ESBL colonized during the
ICU stay.

Conclusion Wastewater sinks were the likely source of ESBL
colonization for 18 ICU patients. After placing self-disinfecting siphons

University Hospital (Inselspital)/University of Bern, Switzerland

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P57 (doi: 10.1186/cc11995)

Introduction Sepsis may cause mitochondrial dysfunction. The
renin—angiotensin system (RAS) activity is increased in sepsis, and
can interfere with the mitochondrial function either directly or by
modifying hemodynamics. We studied the effects of ACE inhibition
by enalapril on hemodynamics and hepatic mitochondrial function in
sepsis. Two septic groups without enalapril and with different blood
pressure targets served as controls.

Methods Sepsis (fecal peritonitis) was induced in 24 anesthetized,
mechanically ventilated pigs (40.1 + 2.1 kg), divided into three groups
(n = 8 for each): ENL (enalapril pretreatment for 7 days and at 0.005 to
0.02 mg/kg/hour during the study; MAP target 75 to 85 mmHg), ML
(target MAP 50 to 60 mmHg), and MH (target MAP 75 to 85 mmHg).
Hemodynamic support with fluids, norepinephrine (NE; maximum
dose 5,000 ug/hour), and antibiotics were started after 12 hours of
peritonitis and continued for 48 hours.

Results All enalapril pigs received the maximum NE dose without
reaching the target MAP. Enalapril resulted in lower MAP, higher
CO, and transiently increased regional blood flows (Table 1). Fluid
administration and urinary output were similar among groups. Liver
mitochondrial respiration was reduced (State 3, State 4) in the enalapril
group. One animal died in each ML and enalapril group.

Conclusion Enalapril enhances cardiac output and early regional blood
flows in sepsis despite lower MAP, and reduces liver mitochondrial
respiration, suggesting that RAS is involved in the hemodynamic and
metabolic changes in sepsis.

Introduction The present study investigated the effects of a single
dose of intraperitoneal (i.p.) IgG and IgGAM administration on various
behavioral alterations in a cecal ligation perforation (CLP)-induced
sepsis model in rats.

Methods Female Wistar albino rats (200 to 250 g) were divided into five
groups (n = 8): a naive Control group, a Sham operated group receiving
conventional antibiotic treatment, a CLP group receiving CLP procedure
and conventional antibiotic treatment, and IgG and IgGAM groups
which were also applied 1 g/kg, i.p. IgG and IGAM therapy 5 minutes
after the CLP procedure. Ten, 30 and 60 days after the surgery, animals
underwent three behavioral tasks: an open field test to evaluate the
locomotor activity, an elevated plus maze test to measure the level of
anxiety, and a forced swim test to assess the possible depressive state.
The results acquired from these tests were used to estimate the effect

of immunoglobulin therapy on behavioral changes in CLP-induced
sepsis in rats.

Results In the open field test, the CLP group showed a significant
decrease in total squares passed on days 10 and 30. Similarly, total
numbers of rearing and grooming were dramatically decreased in the
CLP group in comparison with control and sham groups (P <0.005).
In the elevated plus maze test, the number of entries to open arms
decreased in the CLP group. In the forced swim test, there was a
tendency for increase in immobility time in the CLP group, although
the data were statistically insignificant. All of these values which were
indicating the importance of behavioral alterations were improved on
day 60. Immunoglobulin therapy prevented the occurrence of these
behavioral changes. Especially, animals in the IgGAM group conserved
the values quite near to those of the control group in measured
parameters.

Conclusion Sepsis, even though it has been treated with conventional
antibiotics, caused a negative effect on behavioral parameters. In this
study, IgG and IgGAM treated animals in the presence of CLP did not
show these behavioral changes. Therefore our results suggest that
a single dose of i.p. IgG and IgGAM treatment, which was applied
immediately after the sepsis procedure, prevents behavioral defects
observed following sepsis.

lwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P59 (doi: 10.1186/cc11997)

Introduction Thrombomodulin is an endothelial cell cofactor and
glycoprotein for thrombin-catalyzed activation of protein C. A recom-
binant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhsTM) has been recently
developed, and this new agent has a unique amino-terminal structure
exhibiting anti-inflammatory activity including sequestraction and
cleavage of high-mobility group box 1(HMGB-1).

Methods In this study, 13 patients with septic disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC) were treated with rhsTM, which is Recomodulin® Inj.
12800 (Asahi Kasei Pharma Co., Tokyo, Japan). Patients with septic DIC
were treated with 130 to 380 U/kg/day.

Results There were significant results for improvement of APACHE
Il score and DIC diagnostic criteria score for critically ill patients after
treatment using rhsTM (P <0.01). Improvement for platelet count and
D-dimer level were also observed in this study (P <0.05). Activation
of antithrombin (AT) also was significantly increased after treatment
(P <0.05). Hospital mortality was 15.4% in this study.

Conclusion The rhsTM might be one of most important endogenous
regulators of coagulation, acting as the major inhibitor of thrombin as
well as AT Ill. This new agent may play an important role in treatment
for septic DIC.

Introduction Antithrombin Ill (AT III) has been known to contribute to
anti-inflammatory response as well as its anticoagulation. Our previous

----$$$$----$$$$----

study showed AT Ill deficiency happened in the early stage of sepsis
with no relation to DIC status. However, whether AT Ill concentrate
is a beneficial therapy or not for septic patients is controversial.
Our hypothesis is that AT Ill concentrate may have efficacy as anti-
inflammation for sepsis.

Methods From January 2009 to December 2011, adult septic patients,
whom were given AT Ill concentrate in our medico-surgical ICU, were
included in this study. AT II] concentrate was administered 30 to 60 U/kg
intravenously every 24 hours for 3 days in the patients with DIC status
and AT Ill deficiency. Between before and after the AT Ill concentrate
therapy, WBC (/mm?), CRP (mg/dl), platelet (x10*/ul), PT (seconds),
fibrinogen (mg/dl), FDP (ug/ml), SOFA score and DIC score were
evaluated. Values are expressed as mean + SD. Data were analyzed by
Wilcoxon signed-rank test. P <0.05 was considered significant.

Results There were 85 patients (52 men, 33 women; age range 19 to
92 years (mean 69.0 + 16.9)), and the mortality rate was 27.1% and
APACHE II score was 20.1 + 7.6. WBC, CRP, PT and SOFA score were
significantly improved after AT Ill concentrate therapy (13,176 + 9,400
vs. 11,693 + 7,089, P = 0.011, 15.9 vs. 13.3, P = 0.0015, 16.5 + 4.4 vs.
15.9+5.9, P=0.0045, and 9.7 + 3.8 vs. 8.6 + 4.6, P= 0.01, respectively).
Platelet was significantly decreased (11.7 + 9.7 vs. 10.6 + 9.0, P= 0.028),
while there were no significant differences in fibrinogen, FDP and
DIC score (387.3 + 202.6 vs. 381.8 + 163.2, P = 0.088, 36.9 + 52.7 vs.
28.8 + 39.9, P =0.059, and 2.9 + 1.6 vs. 2.6 + 1.8, P= 0.25, respectively)
after the therapy. One week after the therapy, platelet and DIC score
were significantly improved compared with before the therapy
(15.6 + 10.0, P= 0.0036 and 1.8 + 1.9, P= 0.0041).

Conclusion In the patients with septic DIC, WBC, CRP and SOFA score
were immediately improved after the AT III concentrate therapy, while
platelet and DIC score were improved later. AT Ill concentrate may also
contribute to anti-inflammatory for septic DIC with anticoagulation.

A clinical randomized trial on the use of atorvastatin in patients
with sepsis or septic shock: effects on endothelial function

Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P61 (doi: 10.1186/cc11999)

Introduction Sepsis and septic shock are complex inflammatory
syndromes. Multiple cellular activation processes are involved, and
many humoral cascades are triggered. Presumably, endothelial cells
play a pivotal rule in the pathogenesis of sepsis, not only because
they may influence the inflammatory cascade but also because, upon
interaction with excessive amounts of inflammatory mediators, the
function of these cells may become impaired. It is likely that a general
dysfunction of the endothelium is a key event in the pathogenesis
of sepsis [1]. HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors have been shown to
exhibit pronounced immunomodulatory effects independent of lipid
lowering. Most of these beneficial effects of statins appear to involve
restoring or improving endothelial function [2]. We hypothesize that
statins can improve endothelial dysfunction in septic patients.
Methods A double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial
was undertaken. We enrolled adult patients within 24 hours of severe
sepsis or septic shock diagnosis and randomized them to placebo or
atorvastatin 80 mg/day for a short term. Endothelial dysfunction was
assessed measuring plasmatic levels of IL-6, ET-1, VCAM-1 by ELISA and
measuring flow-mediated vasodilatation of the brachial artery at basal,
24 and 72 hours after randomization.

Results We studied 47 patients, 24 in the placebo group (mean age
52 + 20 years, 29.1% male; APACHE II risk score 23.5 + 7.3) and 23 in
the statin group (mean age 49.5 + 18 years, 53.4% male; APACHE II risk
score 23 + 6.9). The baseline characteristics of the placebo group were
similar to statin patients as well as the mean length of stay in the ICU
(8.6 + 7.4 and 9.1 + 8 days, respectively) and the time on vasopressors
(49.3 + 47.1 and 59 + 91.1 hours, respectively). No significant difference
was observed on the temporal variation of biomarker levels (IL-6,
VCAM-1, ET-1) between treatment and control groups. The intrahospital
mortality rate was 26% in the statin group and 45% in the placebo
group (P=0.17).

Conclusion Our data showed no benefit with the use of a potent

statin acutely in patients with sepsis or septic shock with regards to

improvement in endothelial function.

Introduction A novel sorbent hemoadsorption device for cytokine
removal (CytoSorbents, USA) was developed and successfully tested
in animal models of sepsis. The experience in the clinical setting is
still limited to case reports. In this first clinical trial, we tested the
hypothesis that treatment with sorbent hemoadsorption could safely
and effectively reduce cytokines in septic patients with acute lung
injury (ALI).

Methods Ventilated patients fulfilling the criteria for severe sepsis and
ALI were enrolled in this multicenter randomized, controlled, open-
label study comparing standard of care with or without hemoperfusion
treatment. Primary endpoints were safety and IL-6 reduction. Treated
patients underwent hemoperfusion at flow rates of ~200 to 300 ml/
minute for 6 hours per day for 7 consecutive days. The overall mean
reduction in individual plasma cytokines for the control and treatment
groups during the treatment period was calculated using a generalized
linear model.

Results Forty-three patients (18 treated, 25 control) completed the
study and were further analyzed. Incidence of organ dysfunction at
enrollment (treatment vs. control) was: septic shock (94% vs. 100%,
P = 0.42), acute respiratory distress syndrome (67% vs. 56%, P = 0.33),
and renal failure (39% vs. 24%, P = 0.54). During 115 treatments no
serious device-related adverse events occurred. On average, there
were no changes in hematology and other blood parameters except
for a modest reduction in platelet count (<10%) and albumin (<5%)
with treatment. Hemoperfusion decreased IL-6 blood concentration
significantly (-49.1%, P = 0.01), with similar reductions of MCP-1
(-49.5%, P = 0.002), IL-1ra (-36.5%, P = 0.001), and IL-8 (—30.2%, P =
0.002). The 28-day mortality (28% vs. 24% control, P = 0.84) and 60-
day mortality (39% vs. 32% control, P = 0.75) did not differ significantly
between the two studied groups.

Conclusion In this first clinical study of anovel sorbent hemoadsorption
device in patients with severe sepsis and ALI, the device appeared to
be safe and decreased the blood concentration of several cytokines.
Further research is needed to study the effect of the device on the
clinical outcome of septic patients.

Methods Forty septic/septic shock patients with renal failure were
enrolled in the study. All patients had preoperative endotoxin
>0.6 level/units (EAA Spectral D) and were submitted to high-volume
hemodiafiltration (50 ml/kg/hour, Prismaflex; Gambro) with a new
treated heparin-coated membrane (oXiris; Gambro). At TO (pre-
treatment) and T1 (24 hours) the main clinical and biochemical data
were evaluated. All data are expressed as mean + SD. One-way ANOVA
test with Bonferroni correction was used to evaluate the data changes.
P <0.05 was considered significant.

Results Table 1 presents the main results of this study.

Conclusion In septic/septic shock patients with renal failure, CRRT with
a new treated heparin-coated membrane (oXiris; Gambro) is clinically
feasible, and has a positive effect on renal function and hemodynamics.
An adsorbing effect on proinflammatory mediators may have a role in
these results. These data and the trend toward a decrease of endotoxin
during the treatment warrant further investigation.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P64 (doi: 10.1186/cc12002)

Introduction The usefulness of a pumpless extracorporeal lung assist
system (pECLA) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in
critically ill patients has been demonstrated in previous studies [1,2].
The aim of this report was to examine combined use of pECLA and
CRRT to improve carbon dioxide and inflammatory mediator removal,
which allows for lung protective ventilation strategies.

Methods In our 10 patients with ARDS due to polytrauma and sepsis,
pECLA was established by insertion of cannulae to the femoral artery
and vein. CRRT cannulae were introduced by venous line of the same
vascular access (Figure 1). We preferred regional anticoagulation with
trisodium citrate for both CRRT and ILA.

Results Mean SAPS Il and APACHE II scores were 55 and 23 respectively.
Mean time on mechanical ventilation was 22 days. Mean ICU stay was
30 days for survivors and 38 days for nonsurvivors. When compared
with baseline values most relevant parameters were the improvement
in tidal volumes, plateau pressures, PaCO, levels and pH (Figure 2). Four
patients survived while six patients died from sepsis-MOF.

Conclusion We concluded that pECLA can effectively address the
impaired gas exchange in ARDS and CRRT is a safe procedure with
potential therapeutic value for treating MOF. Citrate anticoagulation
was well tolerated and filter life was appropriate. The use of the same
vascular access for ILA and CRRT may minimize invasive procedures
and related side effects.

shock

Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P66 (doi: 10.1186/cc12004)

Introduction Endotoxin, acomponent of the outer membrane of Gram-
negative bacteria, is considered an important factor in pathogenesis
of septic shock [1]. The aim of our study was to determine whether
endotoxin elimination treatment added to the standard treatment
would improve organ function in patients with septic shock.
Methods Adult patients with septic shock who required renal
replacement therapy (RRT), with a confirmed endotoxemia, and
suspected Gram-negative infection were consecutively added to the
study within the first 24 hours after diagnosis. All patients received
full standard treatment for septic shock. Endotoxin elimination was
performed using the membrane oXiris (Gambro, Sweden), a medical
device for continued RRT with the unique feature of endotoxin
adsorbtion. An endotoxin activity assay was used to monitor endotoxin
elimination therapy at baseline (TO), 3 hours (T1), 12 hours (T2),
24 hours (T3), 48 hours (T4), and 72 hours (T5). Our key indicators were
the improvement in hemodynamics and organ function, and decrease
of endotoxin activity (EA) in blood. Continuous variables are presented
as mean values with standard deviations.
Results High EA level at baseline (0.74 + 0.14 endotoxin activity units
(EAU)) significantly decreased during RRT with oXiris membrane
to 0.46 + 0.02 (T1), 0.34 + 0.01 (T2), 0.4 + 0.02 (T3), 0.46 + 0.04 (T4),
0.35 + 0.07 (T5) EAU (P <0.05). MAP increased from baseline 72 + 14
to 81+ 18, 76+ 6, 77 + 7, 83 + 13, 87 + 10 mmHg (P <0.05), and the
mean norepinephrine use decreased from 0.23 + 0.04 to 0.19 + 0.02,
0.11 + 0.01, 0.09 + 0.01, 0.04 + 0.01, 0.0 ug/kg/minute (P <0.05) at TO, T1,
72,73, 14,15, respectively. The SOFA score had decreased from 14+ 4 to
12+ 2,9 + 3, 7+3 points (P <0.05), and the procalcitonin level declined
from 107 + 123 to 45 + 41, 29 + 30, 17 + 157 + 1 ng/ml (P <0.05) at TO,
T3,74,T5.
Conclusion RRT with oXiris membrane resulted in the effective
elimination of endotoxins from the blood. The therapy was associated
with an increase in blood pressure, a reduction of vasopressor
requirements, and an improvement of organ function. The application
of the endotoxin activity assay was useful for bedside monitoring of
endotoxemia in ICU patients.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P67 (doi: 10.1186/cc12005)

Introduction Severe sepsis and septic shock remain the most serious
problem of critical care medicine with a mortality rate of 30 to 55%
[1]. Several studies have demonstrated positive effects of selective
adsorption of LPS on blood pressure, PaO,/FiO, ratio, endotoxin
removal and mortality [2,3]. The purpose of the study was to evaluate
the efficiency of using the selective adsorption of LPS, Toraymyxin -
PMX-F (Toray, Japan) and Alteco® LPS Adsorber (Alteco Medical AB,
Sweden), in the complex treatment of patients with severe sepsis.
Methods Forty-six patients with Gram-negative sepsis in the
postoperative period were enrolled into the study. Toraymyxin — PMX-F
was used in the PMX-F group (n = 14), while Alteco LPS adsorption
was used in the Alteco LPS group (n = 32). The clinical characteristics
are listed in Table 1. The SOFA score, PaO,/FiO,, procalcitonin (PCT),
C-reactive protein (CRP), endotoxin activity assay (EAA) was noted
before, 24 and 48 hours after the selective adsorption of LPS.

Results At 48 hours after PMX-F, significantly decreased PCT from 17.5
(5.0; 40.9) to 7.1 (4.8; 13.0) ng/ml, P = 0.028, decreased CRP from 180

(133; 286) to 132 (68; 155) mg/l, P= 0.015 and SOFA score from 7.0 (3,0;
8.0) to 6.0 (3,0; 7.0), P= 0.007. At 24 hours after Alteco LPS, significantly
decreased PCT from 8.7 (3.0; 25.9) to 4.8 (2.1; 10.0) ng/ml. The 28-day
mortality rate was 14.2% (n = 2) in the PMX-F group and 31.3% (n = 10)
in the Alteco LPS group.

Table 1 (abstract P67). Clinical characteristics of the groups

Characteristic PMX-F Alteco LPS
Sex M/F 9/5 17/15
Age (years) 41.6+17.1 42.1+13.5

APACHE II 21 (17; 25) 21 (16; 24)
SOFA 7 (3.0; 8) 7 (3.5; 11)

Conclusion The use of the LPS-selective adsorption (particularly
PMX-F) in patients with severe sepsis leads to improvement of systemic
inflammation and organ dysfunction.

Alteco endotoxin hemoadsorption in Gram-negative septic shock
patients

HP Shum, KC Chan, WW Yan

Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, Hong Kong

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P68 (doi: 10.1 186/cc12006)

Introduction Septic shock is a common cause of mortality and
morbidity in the ICU. Endotoxin hemoadsorption using a Polymyxin B
fiber column can improve patient outcome [1]. This study investigated
the therapeutic effect of a new endotoxin hemoadsorption device in
Gram-negative septic shock patients.

Methods An open, controlled, prospective, randomized, single-centre
trial conducted between February 2010 and June 2012. Patients
with septic shock due to intra-abdominal sepsis were recruited and
randomized to either standard therapy (ST, n = 8) or standard therapy
plus two 2 hourly sessions of Alteco endotoxin hemoperfusion (AT, n =
7). Standard therapy included infective source control, appropriate
early antibiotic, low-dose steroid, early continuous renal replacement
therapy in the presence of acute kidney injury (RIFLE Injury class or
more), hemodynamic optimization and lung-protected ventilatory
support. Primary outcome was change in organ dysfunction at 48
hours measured by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
scores. Secondary outcomes were change in vasopressor requirement
(measured by vasopressor score), PaO./FiO, (fraction of inspired
oxygen) ratio, total urine output at 72 hours and 28-day mortality.
Results This study was terminated early as interim analysis identified
no significant clinical benefit. Baseline characteristics (age/APACHE
IV score) were similar between two groups of patients. No significant
difference was noted between two groups with respect to change in
total SOFA score (+1 vs. —5.5 for AT vs. ST, P = 0.382), vasopressor score
(-29 vs. -46.6, P = 0.775), PaO./FiO, ratio (-26 vs. +163, P = 0.199), total
urine output from 0 to 72 hours (3,850 ml vs. 4,570 ml, P = 0.355) and
28-day mortality (14.3% vs. 37.5%, P = 0.569). No significant side effect
was noted when using this new hemoadsorption device.

Conclusion This small study cannot identify any extra clinical benefit
on addition of Alteco endotoxin hemoadsorption to standard therapy
in patients suffering from intra-abdominal sepsis with shock due to
Gram-negative bacterial infection.

Steroid therapy in septic shock: survey of practice amongst UK
critical care physicians

G Rajendran, K Dasari, A Dhrampal

Norfolk & Norwich University Hospital, Norwich, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P69 (doi: 10.1186/cc12007)

Introduction Corticosteroid (CS) therapy in sepsis remains contro-
versial and was first introduced in sepsis management for its anti-
inflammatory property. CS has found a role in septic shock amelioration
with inconsistent outcomes. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC)
includes CS as a Level 2C recommendation in septic shock [1]. Adapting
and practicing SSC guidelines vary between critical care units.
Accordingly, a survey was conducted to elucidate the usage of CS for
septic shock by UK critical care physicians (CCPs).

Methods Following approval by the UK Intensive Care Society (ICS), the
survey was publicised on the ICS website and its newsletter.

Results A total of 81 intensivists responded to this online survey.
Seventy-four (92.5%) CCPs prescribed CS only if the septic shock is
poorly responsive to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy.
Six (7.5%) initiated CS at the same time as vasopressor therapy.
None initiated CS for patients with severe sepsis. No CS other than
hydrocortisone is being used. The most commonly used intravenous
regimen is 50 mg 6 hourly (65%) followed by 50 mg 8 hourly (11%).
Only 10% of CCPs would prescribe it by infusion. Less commonly used
regimens were 100 mg 8 hourly (6%) and 100 mg 6 hourly (5%). Only
5% would consider adding fludrocortisone. Prior to initiating CS, 5% of
CCPs would perform a short synacthen test, while 94% would not. The
majority (89%) of CCPs would stop CS after resolution of shock state

S25

or when vasopressor infusion is terminated whilst 11% after a fixed
duration. Withdrawal of CS also differed, in that 25% tapered/weaned
steroids, 31% stopped it abruptly and 44% of CCPs would base their
CS cessation pattern on the clinical context. Only 46% of CCPs believe
that CS is beneficial whereas 44% were unsure of the benefits in septic
shock. Only 29 (36%) responders indicated that their critical care unit
had a written protocol for CS in septic shock.

Conclusion The perceptions, usage and cessation of CS in septic shock
vary but do appear to have shifted in the last decade. A UK survey in
2003 identified that only 60% of ICUs used CS for septic shock and
over 22% perform a short synacthen test [2]. It appears that many
intensivists are using CS for septic shock, despite conflicting outcome
data. We all strive to practice evidence-based medicine but until we
have a robust, reliable and methodical randomised control trial that
attempts to resolve the CS debate, practice will remain diverse on this
subject, as reflected by our survey.

Introduction It is postulated that clinical benefit of low-dose
hydrocortisone in septic shock is related to reversal of relative adrenal
insufficiency [1]. This was proved in an animal model of sepsis.
Methods Sixty-nine Wistar male rats were assigned to the following
groups: A, sham-operation; B, sepsis; C, bilateral adrenalectomy
and sepsis; D, bilateral adrenalectomy, sepsis and hydrocortisone
treatment; E, bilateral adrenalectomy, sepsis and ertapenem treatment;
and F, bilateral adrenalectomy, sepsis, hydrocortisone and ertapenem
treatment. Sepsis was induced by the i.p. infusion of 1x10° cfu/ml of
Escherichia coli after adrenalectomy. Hydrocortisone 10 mg/kg was
infused i.v. bid starting 1 hour after bacterial challenge. Ertapenem
5 mg/kg was infused i.v. once daily starting 1 hour after bacterial
challenge. Survival was recorded. In a separate set of experiments in
18 rats, animal sacrifice was performed to measure the free cortisol
concentration.

Results Survival is shown in Figure 1. Experiments in each animal were
starting at 7:00 am. At 8:00 am, respective mean free cortisol of groups
A, Cand D was 1.81, 0.55 and 2.05 g/dl; at 1:00 pm they were 0.92, 0.47
and 1.40 yg/dl.

Impact of time to initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy on
early mortality of patients with septic shock

JP Quenot', C Binquet?, S Vinault?, A Pavon'

‘University Hospital Dijon, France; CHU de Dijon, Centre d‘investigation
Clinique — Epidémiologie Clinique, Dijon, France

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P71 (doi: 10.1186/cc12009)

Introduction The impact of appropriate antibiotic therapy on
prognosis of patients with septic shock is well established. However,
the prognostic influence of time to initiation of antibiotics remains
debated. We evaluated the effect on 7-day mortality of time to initiation
of appropriate antibiotic therapy in patients hospitalised in critical care
for septic shock.

Methods Secondary analysis from the EPISS cohort. We included only
patients admitted to the University Hospital Dijon. Septic shock was
defined as initiation of vasopressors in a patient with suspected or
documented infection with at least one criterion of hypoperfusion
(metabolic acidosis and/or renal insufficiency and/or hepatic dysfunc-
tion). We excluded patients with no available bacteriological data. Anti-
biotherapy was considered appropriate if at least one of the antibiotics
prescribed was active against the germ identified. Bivariate and
multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the impact of
time to initiation of appropriate antibiotherapy on 7-day mortality.
Results In total, 383 patients were admitted with septic shock, of
whom 253 (66%) were included; 231(92%) had appropriate antibiotic
therapy, of whom 52 (22.5%) died at 7 days. Average time to initiation
of appropriate antibiotic therapy was 9 + 23 hours. By bivariate
analysis, body mass index (BMI) <20, SAPS II =>56, SOFA score =11 and
bacteremia were significantly associated with 7-day mortality. Urinary
tract infection (UTI) was a protective factor. Age, sex, comorbidities
(particularly immunosuppression), Knaus score, nosocomial infection
and type of germ had no influence on 7-day mortality. By multivariate
logistic regression, BMI <20 (OR = 4.87, 95% Cl = 1.36 to 17.43, P= 0.01)
and SOFA score =11 (OR = 7.99, 95% Cl = 3.11 to 20.5, P <0.001) were
the only factors significantly associated with 7-day mortality. UTI was a
significant protective factor (OR = 0.30, 95% Cl = 0.10 to 0.88, P = 0.03).
Time to initiation of appropriate antibiotherapy was not associated
with 7-day mortality (OR = 0.99, 95% Cl = 0.99 to 1.00, P = 0.48).
Conclusion Prognosis at 7 days of patients with septic shock is
largely related to the number of failing organs. The majority received
appropriate antibiotic therapy although time to initiation is longer
than recommended. Further efforts are warranted to reduce mortality
in patients with septic shock.

Comparison of survivors and nonsurvivors in 27 confirmed
injectional anthrax cases from the 2009 outbreak in Scotland

‘Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, Uk; National Institutes for Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P72 (doi: 10.1186/cc12010)

Introduction From December 2009 to December 2010, 47 patients in
Scotland presented with confirmed anthrax infection manifested by
soft tissue disease related to heroin injection. These cases represent
the first known outbreak of a recently recognized form of anthrax,
termed injectional anthrax, which appears to be associated with a high
mortality rate (28% in confirmed cases from the UK outbreak). While
epidemiologic data from this outbreak have been published, no report
has systematically described findings in patients at presentation or
compared these findings in nonsurvivors and survivors.

Methods To better describe injectional anthrax, we developed a
questionnaire and sent it to clinicians who had cared for confirmed

$26

cases during the outbreak. Completed questionnaires describing 27
patients, 11 nonsurvivors and 16 survivors, were returned.

Results In preliminary analysis of categorical data, a significantly
(Fisher exact test) greater proportion of patients with compared with
without the following findings did not survive; history of alcohol
use (P = 0.05); the presence of lethargy (P = 0.01), confusion (P =
0.03), nausea (P = 0.04), abdominal pain (P = 0.02), or the need for
vasopressors (P = 0.002), oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or steroids
(all P = 0.004) at presentation; and excessive bleeding at surgery (P =
0.01). Initial analysis of continuous data demonstrated that, compared
with survivors at presentation, nonsurvivors had significantly (one-way
ANOVA) increased respiratory rate, percent neutrophils on complete
blood count, hemoglobin, INR, C-reactive protein, and bilirubin and
significantly decreased temperature, systolic blood pressure, platelets,
sodium, albumin, calcium (corrected for albumin), base excess and
bicarbonate (all P <0.05).

Conclusion The implications of the apparent differences noted
between nonsurvivors and survivors in this survey of cases from the
first known outbreak of injectional anthrax require further study.
However, these differences might inform the design of research during
future outbreaks or of methods to identify patients most in need of
anthrax-specific therapies such as toxin-directed antibodies.

Efficacy and utility of preemptive anti-Gr(+) coverage in selected
critically ill patients

VT Todorova, SM Milanov, G Georgiev, M Milanov

Emergency Hospital ‘Pirogov; Sofia, Bulgaria

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P73 (doi: 10.1186/cc12011)

Introduction Based on the results of our previous studies [1] we have
identified clinical risk factors for the emergence of Gr(+) infections in
our ICU and we have developed a new algorithm for combating them.
The choice of the particular antibiotic drug is guided by additional
risk factors for severity of illness and data on the infectious focus. The
response to therapy and its duration are also stated. The aim of the
current study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this preemptive
approach.
Methods A randomized prospective controlled trial was carried out
from September 2010 to September 2012. Patients were submitted
to block randomization and stratified on the basis of their initial SAPS
Il exp score. Antibiotic therapy was started on the day of inclusion
in the treatment group and only with proven Gr(+) pathogen in the
control group. Initial data were gathered on demographics, diagnosis,
proven risk factors for sepsis-related mortality, severity of inflammatory
response, ventilator-associated pneumonia and organ dysfunction.
Dynamics of SIRS, CPIS and SOFA scores, subsequent infectious isolates,
ventilator-free days, length of ICU stay and outcome were followed for
each patient.
Results A total of 170 patients were enrolled. No statistically significant
differences in their basal characteristics were found. The subsequent
score values, length of ICU stay and the number of ventilator-free days
were also comparable between groups. The majority of Gr(+) pathogens
were isolated between 6 and 10 days of inclusion. No differences were
found regarding the concomitant Gr(-) flora and the related antibiotic
therapy. The new organ dysfunction severity was similar in both groups
(P = 0.37). The in-hospital mortality was 26.2% in the treatment group
versus 18.6% in the control group (P = 0.56). Significant differences
between the Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were also not found
(log-rank test P = 0.81). No major adverse reactions were observed.
Conclusion The implementation of this new policy failed to reduce
the degree of organ dysfunction severity and was not associated with
significant survival benefit. Moreover, even though it did not reach
statistical significance, a second peak of Gr(+) isolates was observed
as a possible complication of the preemptive therapy. Whether this
approach could lead to vancomycin MIC creep or there could still be
a niche for it later in the course of treatment and/or in nontrauma
patients remains to be further explored.

Gram-negative resistance and need for ICU among urinary tract
infections in the United States

M Zilberberg', A Shorr?

'EviMed Research Group, LLC, Goshen, MA, USA; ?Washington Hospital Center,
Washington, DC, USA

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P74 (doi: 10.1186/cc1201 2)

Introduction Urinary tract infection (UTI) can lead to both hospitali-
zation and severe sepsis. We theorized that UTI due to Gram-
negative (GN) multidrug-resistant P. ageruginosa (MDR-PA), extended-
spectrum B-lactamase (ESBL), F. coli (EC) and Klebsiella sp. (KP), and
carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) would be
frequently isolated in the ICU.

Methods We analyzed a large US-based microbiology database,
Eurofins TSN, between the years 2000 and 2009. We determined the
proportion of isolates caused by MDR-PA, ESBL-EC, ESBL-KP, and CPE
relative to their susceptible counterparts. We defined MDR-PA as any
isolate resistant to >3 drug classes. ESBL organisms were defined as
E. coliand K. pneumoniae resistant to a third-generation cephalosporin.
Enterobacteriaceae were considered CPE if resistant to both a third-
generation cephalosporin and a carbapenem. We further examined
the evolution of the frequency of resistance among GN UTIs over time.
Results We identified 115,201 PA (13.7% MDR-PA), 359,090 EC (5.6%
ESBL), 97,419 KP (12.9% ESBL), and 176,110 Enterobacteriaceae (0.6%
CPE) UTI specimens. The prevalence of resistance rose for each organism
of interest from 2000 through 2009: MDR-PA, 11.6 to 12.3%; ESBL-EC,
3.3 to 8.0%; ESBL-KP, 9.1 to 18.6%; CPE 0 to 2.3%. For each organism
the proportion of resistant pathogens was consistently higher among
ICU specimens than among specimens from other hospital locations,
reaching nearly 20% for MDR-PA (Figure 1).

Conclusion The microbiology of GN UTI hospitalizations has shifted
over the last decade and greater antimicrobial resistance is evident. The
prevalence of MDR-PA, ESBL-EC, ESBL-KP, and CPE is higher in the ICU
than in other hospital locations.

Multidrug resistance among P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae
in US hospitals, 2000 to 2009

M Zilberberg', A Shorr?

'EviMed Research Group, LLC, Goshen, MA, USA; Washington Hospital Center,
Washington, DC, USA

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P75 (doi: 10.1186/cc12013)

Introduction Gram-negative resistance remains a major challenge
in the care of critically ill patients. Traditionally, PR aeruginosa (PA) has
represented the most concerning pathogen. However, carbapenemase-
producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) have emerged as a challenge, but
the epidemiology of this pathogen is poorly understood.

$27

Methods We analyzed a large US-based microbiology database,
Eurofins TSN, between the years 2000 and 2009. We aimed to describe
the prevalence of infection with either multidrug-resistant (MDR) PA or
CPE. We defined MDR-PA as any PA isolate resistant to >3 drug classes.
Enterobacteriaceae were classified as CPE if resistant to both a third-
generation cephalosporin and a carbapenem. We evaluated specimens
from respiratory, bloodstream, urinary tract (UTI) and complicated
intra-abdominal infections.

Results We identified 327,912 PA (60,695 (18.5%) MDR-PA) and 279,600
Enterobacteriaceae (2,558 (0.9%) CPE) specimens. More than one-
quarter (26.1%) of all PA were recovered from ICU patients as compared
with 17.9% of all Enterobacteriaceae specimens. Of those specimens
originating in the ICU, MDR-PA represented 21.9% of all PA organisms,
while CPE represented 1.6% of all Enterobacteriaceae. Pheumonia and
UTI accounted for 92.4% of all PA and 84.0% of all Enterobacteriaceae
specimens. The proportion of both MDR-PA and CPE was highest in
pneumonia (22.0% and 1.6%, respectively) and lowest in UTI (13.7%
and 0.6%, respectively). Over the time frame of the study, CPEs emerged
and stabilized at approximately 2.8% of all Enterobacteriaceae, while
MDR-PA increased slightly from 16.0% of all PA in 2000 to 17.8% in 2009.
Conclusion Although CPE organisms have emerged as an important
pathogen, MDR-PA remains an order of magnitude more prevalent
in the United States. Pneumonia patients and those in the ICU are at
an increased risk for both MDR-PA and CPE infections compared with
those outside the ICU.

Prevalence of multidrug resistance, extensive drug resistance
and pandrug resistance among multiple Gram-negative isolates:
experience in a tertiary-care hospital ICU in North India

Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, New Delhi, India

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P76 (doi: 10.1186/cc12014)

Introduction Antibiotic resistance is a major worldwide problem
in the ICU [1]. The situation in developing countries like India is
particularly serious. Since the presence of drug-resistant bacteria in
the environment is a threat for public health, up-to-date information
on local pathogens and the drug sensitivity pattern is very crucial to
treat patients. This study was carried out to evaluate the prevalence
of multidrug resistance (MDR), extensive drug resistance (XDR) and
pandrug resistance (PDR) among multiple Gram-negative isolates in a
medical-surgical ICU in a tertiary care hospital in North India.
Methods We conducted a prospective observational study. All data
were analysed using descriptive statistics. All Gram-negative culture
isolates over a period of 13 months (October 2011 to October 2012)
were included in this study. Isolation and identification were performed
using the bact alert system and VITEK2, respectively. Sensitivities were
determined by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion and broth dilution using
VITEK2-AST cards and interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute criteria. For the purpose of this study, we used MDR
to denote isolates resistant to representatives three or more classes
of antimicrobial agents, XDR as those resistant to all but one or two
classes and PDR as those resistant to all classes of antimicrobial agents
available [2,3].

Results Out of a total 2,796 culture specimens sent over 13 months,
250 isolates were Gram-negative (8.9%). Among these 250 (n) Gram-
negative isolates, 195 (78%) were extended-spectrum B-lactamase
(ESBL) producers and the remaining 55 (22%) were non-ESBL producers.
Among the ESBL producers, PDR, XDR and MDR isolates were 14
(5.6%), 113 (45.2%) and 68 (27.2%), respectively (Figure 1). Among
the XDR-positive organisms, seven (6.1%) organisms were New Delhi
metallo-B-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) producers and five (4.4%) organisms
were NDM-2 producers. Among ESBL-positive isolates, the most
predominant isolate was Klebsiella pneumoniae (29.7%) followed by
Acinetobacter aeruginosa (22.5%) and Escherichia coli (20.5%) (Figure 2).
Among non-ESBL-positive isolates, the most predominant isolate was
Escherichia coli (34.5%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (21.8%) and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.5%) (Figure 2).

Conclusion ESBL producers were the most frequently isolated Gram-
negative bacterial isolates in this tertiary-care hospital in north India.

Figure 2 (abstract P76). Prevalence of Gram-negative isolates.

Among ESBL producers, XDR organisms were most frequent, followed
by MDR and PDR organisms. Few of the XDR isolates were NDM
producers, which have propensity to spread to other bacteria. In view of
significant prevalence of multidrug resistance amongst Gram-negative
organisms in the ICU, regular surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility
patterns plays a crucial role for setting orders to guide the clinician in

Introduction Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baum) is a leading cause of
septicemia of patients hospitalized in the ICU with high mortality rates.
The aim of our study is to investigate the risk factors associated with
A. baum bacteremia and its mortality rates.

Methods A total of 937 patients (457 women and 480 men, median
age 59) admitted to the ICU during the period 1 January 2009 to 30
September 2012 were enrolled in our retrospective study. Blood
cultures were obtained from all patients. The identification and the
antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed by the automated
system VITEK2 (Bio Merieux, France). Data collected included
underlying diseases, malignancies and immune suppression (MIS),
prognostic factors (APACHE score, adjusted mortality), age, sex, length
of ICU stay (LS), recent administration of broad-spectrum B-lactam
antibiotics (especially carbapenems; ABL), mechanical ventila-
tion (MV), implementation of invasive procedures (central venous
catheter and urine catheter; INV.PR) and outcome. At first a univariate
statistical model was used with significance level set at P = 0.05. For
the multivariate statistical analysis model we used all variables with

S28

P <0.05 from the previous model and those mentioned at recent
medical literature as significantly related with A. baum septicemia and
its mortality.

Results A total of 101 patients (10.78%) developed bloodstream
infection caused by A. baum and the mortality rate due to A. baum
septicemia was estimated as 49.5% (50/101). Multiple regression
analysis revealed adjusted mortality >55% (Exp(B) = 2.01, P = 0.013),
MIS (Exp(B) = 1.97, P = 0.017), ABL (Exp(B) = 2.34, P = 0.009), LS >14
days (Exp(B) = 1.34, P= 0.034), MV (Exp(B) = 2.67, P= 0.005) and INV.PR
(Exp(B) = 3.27, P = 0.001) as independent risk factors associated with
A. baum septicemia.

Conclusion The fact that the probability of A. baum bacteremia
increases in immunocompromised patients reflects the opportunistic
characteristic of these infections. MV accelerates respiratory A. baum
colonization, which is a risk factor for AB bacteremia. Recent INV.
PR increased the incidence of A. baum bacteremia and this result is
probably related to the severe status in patients with central venous
catheter. The administration of carbapenems inhibits the growth of
other more susceptible bacteria, allowing the growth of multidrug-
resistant A. baum.

Introduction The French military hospital at the Kaboul International
Airport (KalA) base provides surgical care for International Force
and Afghan National Army soldiers, and also local patients. The
development of multiresistant bacteria (MRB) nosocomial infections
has raised a major problem complicating the care of combat casualties
[1]. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of MRB carriage on
admission to the ICU in this combat support hospital.
Methods We used a prospective observation study on patients
admitted to the French military ICU in KalA over 3 months (July to
September 2012). All hospitalized patients were assessed for the
presence of colonization with MRB: nasal and rectal swabs were
performed to identify, respectively, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum B-lactamases bacteria (ESBLB).
The following data were recorded for each patient on admission:
demographic characteristics, bacteriological results, length of stay,
type of previous hospitalization.
Results Sixty-three patients were admitted. The mean length of stay
(MLS) was 3 + 3 days, and the mean age was 25 + 14 (13 patients
<15 years). Patients were hospitalized for combat-related trauma
(74%), noncombat-related trauma, medical pathologies (10%), and
postoperative care (8%). They were Afghans (92%) or westerners
(8%). Swabs were not realized for eight patients. Forty-three percent
revealed an ESBLB colonization: Escherichia coli (22 patients), Klebsiella
pneumoniae (one patient), Acinetobacter baumanii (one patient). No
patients were colonized with MRSA. Ten patients (16%) were directly
admitted to the ICU, 12 (19%) had been hospitalized before admission,
39 (62%) were transferred after resuscitative and stabilization care
in a level 2 unit. For the two last categories, the MLS (for previous
hospitalization) was respectively 14 + 28 days and 8 + 6 hours. Among
patients transferred after care in a level 2 unit, MLS was no different
between colonized and noncolonized patients: 8 + 7 versus 9 + 6 hours
(P= 0.5, Mann-Whitney test).
Conclusion In this study, prevalence of colonization with ESBLB
at admission is very high, suggesting a high prevalence of MDR
colonization in the local population in Afghanistan. It remains important
to intensify the prevention policy against MRB cross-transmission in
the deployed ICU.

Introduction Providencia stuartii, a member of the family of Entero-
bacteriacea, is a Gram-negative pathogen causing colonization and
opportunistic infections in ICU patients.

Methods We retrospectively recorded the characteristics of P stuartii
infections in our ICU in a total period of 1 year (six-bed general ICU).
Results A total of 116 patients (80 males, 68.9%) were hospitalized in
our ICU of mean age 58.5 + 1.8, mean ICU stay: 23.2 + 3.3 days, APACHE
Il: 19.3 + 0.7, SAPS Il: 45.7 + 1.6, SOFA: 7.9 + 0.4 and mortality: 18.9%.
Admission diagnosis was multiple trauma (29.3%), emergency surgery
(37.1%), and medical (33.6%). Of them 21 (18.1%) developed P. stuartii
infection that was related to multiple trauma (P = 0.0289), length of ICU
stay 69.8 + 12.6 (median 51.0) versus 12.6 + 1.7 (median 6.0) (P <0.0001)
and illness severity APACHE II (21.7 + 1.3 vs. 17.5 + 0.8; P= 0.0056), SAPS
Il (54.9 + 2.9 vs. 43.6 + 1.8; P= 0.0296) and SOFA (10.6 + 0.5 vs. 7.2 + 0.4;
P <0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference regarding
sex, age or mortality (P = 0.3789). Mean day of first isolation was
31.1 + 2.1 (median 28.0). The number of isolations per site were - blood:
11 (median day: 25.0), tracheal aspirates: 9 (median: 28.5), catheter tip:
15 (median: 31.0), urine: 6 (median: 32.0), wound: 12 (median: 25.0),
biological fluids: 4 (median: 29.5), other catheters: 1 (median: 28.0),
middle ear: 2 (median: 32.5), and nose: 1 (median: 25.0). Six patients
had only one site isolation and the remaining 15 had multiple sites
of P. stuartii isolation. We totally recorded 63 isolates of which 82.5%
were second-generation and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant,
80.3% aztreonam-resistant and 81% carbapenem-resistant strains
expressing an extended-spectrum B-lactamase phenotype. All patients
had previously received colistin or meropenem or tygecycline for a
median period of 18.5, 15 and 10.5 days, respectively.

Conclusion P. stuartii infection/colonization may develop in critically
ill patients, especially those with multiple trauma and prolonged
ICU stay, and maybe isolated in blood after the 25th day of ICU stay.
Also, infections due to extended-spectrum B-lactamase-producing
multidrug-resistant P. stuartii are an emerging problem.

Introduction The aim of this study is to describe the clinical and
epidemiological profile of ICU patients receiving tigecycline (TGC) and
to evaluate the potential benefits of TGC higher doses.

Methods All patients admitted to our ICU between 1 June 2009 and
31 May 2012 who received TGC were evaluated. Cases were excluded
when infections were not microbiologically confirmed.

Results Over the study period, 100 patients fulfilled the inclusion
criteria: 54 in the SD group (50 mg every 12 hours) and 46 in the HD
group (100 mg every 12 hours). The SD group and the HD group were
not significantly different in terms of age, severity of disease, duration
of TGC therapy, rate of concomitant other active antibiotic use and
of inadequate empirical antimicrobial therapy (IIAT) (P = NS). MDR
A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae were the main pathogens isolated.
The percentage of germs other than A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae
was higher in the SD TGC group (P <0.01). Otherwise infections due to
less susceptible germs (TGC MIC value =1 ug/ml) were mainly treated
with TGC higher doses (P <0.01). No significant differences were found
in terms of ICU mortality (P = 0.8). The rate of abnormal laboratory
measures during TGC treatment was similar between the two groups
(P = NS). No patients required TGC discontinuation or dose reduction
because of suspected adverse events. In the VAP subpopulation

S29

(63 patients: 30 received SD and 33 HD), the clinical cure rate and
microbiological eradication percentage were higher when TGC was
used at higher doses (57.6% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.08 and 57.1% vs. 30.4%;
P=0.1). Table 1 shows multivariate analysis of clinical cure predictors
in the VAP subgroup.

OR (95% Cl) Pvalue
HD TGC 5.93 (1.38 to 25.6) 0.02
TAT 0.23 (0.06 to 0.85) 0.03
SOFA score 0.62 (0.45 to 0.86) <0.01

Conclusion In critically ill patients, HD TGC use seems to be safe and,

combined with other active antibiotics, may increase the rate of MDR

germ VAP clinical success. IIAT and the severity degree of patients’

clinical condition still remain major determinants of VAP treatment

failure.

Introduction Amikacin Inhale (NKTR-061, BAY41-6551) is a drug-
device combination in clinical development for adjunctive treatment
of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients with Gram-negative
pneumonia. The product uses a proprietary vibrating mesh nebulizer
system (PDDS Clinical) with amikacin sulfate formulated for inhalation
(3.2 ml of 125 mg/ml amikacin solution) for a 10-day twice-daily course
of therapy. It is designed for use with two delivery systems: one system
for intubated patients (On-vent; Figure 1), and a second Handheld (HH)
system for patients who are extubated before completing the course
of therapy (Figure 2). We investigated in vitro the amikacin lung dose
delivered by PDDS Clinical.

Methods An estimated lung dose (ELD) for On-vent setting was
measured in vitro after collecting aerosolized amikacin from a filter at
the end of an endotracheal tube during ventilation. The ELD for the HH
device was calculated from the fine particle fraction (FPF <5 um) post-
mouthpiece, multiplied by the in vitro delivered dose post-mouthpiece.
FPF <5 um reflects lung deposition observed during phase 2 clinical
trials [1]. Eighty-one nebulizers with volume median diameter (VMD)

of 4.4+ 0.5 um and output rates of 0.23 + 0.10 ml/minute were tested

for each system. Delivered dose data were fit to the independent

variables (that is, VMD and output rates) using a least-squares fit with

95% confidence limits.

Results Total percentage recoveries for On-vent and HH test runs were

between 85% and 115% of the nominal dose. The mean ELDs were

50 + 9% (On-vent) and 49 + 11% (HH) of the nominal dose. Nebulizers

with longer dosing times and lower VMDs had higher ELD values for

both delivery systems.

Conclusion The results support the use of the PDDS Clinical with either

system to administer aerosolized amikacin with high efficiency and no

dose adjustment is required when switching from the On-vent to the

HH system for extubated patients.

Analysis of parameters in critically ill patients influencing amikacin
peak levels

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P82 (doi: 10.1186/cc12020)

Introduction Recent studies demonstrate that a loading dose
of 25 mg/kg (total body weight) of amikacin in septic patients is
required to reach a sufficient peak concentration. This study examines

$30

parameters influencing the relation between amikacin dose and peak
concentration.

Methods In this retrospective study we looked at 47 patients (128 peak
levels) between 2003 and 2012. Multivariate linear regression analysis
was done for several parameters: administered dose calculated with
total body weight, ideal body weight, adjusted body weight, type of
intensive care patient, BMI, daily fluid balance, SOFA score and APACHE
score, and patient characteristics were analyzed.

Results A linear correlation between dose and amikacin peak level was
confirmed (Figure 1). A total 54.69% of all amikacin administrations did
not result in a therapeutic peak level. The multivariate linear regression
analysis showed the best linear correlation with adjusted body weight
and SOFA score. The comparison of variables between four patient
groups, based on the deviation between measured peak level and
predicted peak level (according the linear correlation), showed new
variables that may influence peak level.

Conclusion This confirms that low doses (<18 mg/kg) of amikacin in
intensive care patients seldom result in a therapeutic peak level. The
proposed loading dose of 25 mg/kg is good for reaching a therapeutic
level, although 29.6% remains subtherapeutic. Due to the linear
correlation, more therapeutic levels may be reached with higher doses
(25 to 30 mg/kg). New variables need further investigation to explain
the high variability in achieved peak level.

Cost implication of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and the financial
impact of probiotic use in its prevention

Introduction Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) occurs in as many
as 30% of patients receiving antibiotics, often leading to increased
morbidity, prolonged in-hospital stay and additional healthcare
resource utilisation. Age, antibiotics and prolonged postoperative ward
and ICU stay have been suggested to be independent risk factors. In
such patient populations, probiotics may be used to prevent antibiotic-
associated diarrhoea, yet they are not routinely recommended as a
component of perioperative care. The aim of this study was to model
the long-term costs associated with AAD and to assess the effectiveness
of probiotics as a preventive strategy.

Methods We developed a simulation model to determine clinical costs
and outcomes attributable to AAD. To assess the cost-effectiveness of
probiotics, as part of a perioperative regime, we constructed a decision

tree. The model observes long-term costs and outcomes of probiotics
as compared with conventional therapy, from a societal perspective.
Input parameters, extracted from meta-analysis, clinical trials and
national databases, include incidence numbers, costs and quality-
adjusted health states for the remaining life (QALYs). Outcomes assessed
were overall costs attributable to ADD and the cost-effectiveness of
probiotics, described as costs/QALY.

Results Our results indicate an estimated incremental lifetime cost of
£13,272.53 per ADD patient, largely driven by increased ICU length of
stay and readmission rates. The addition of probiotics to the standard
perioperative regime is associated with a small survival benefit of
1.2 months, yet a cost reduction of £917.3/ADD patient. The main cost
was increased duration of ICU stay and readmissions, which contribute
to 85% of total expenses.

Conclusion AAD is associated with a significant increase in costs from a
societal perspective. The provision of probiotics can achieve substantial
cost savings and can be recommended as a cost-effective regime in the
perioperative setting. Preventing ADD offers a potentially significant
reduction of in-hospital costs and resource expenditures.

Empirical versus preemptive antimycotic therapy in terms of
outcome benefit

S Milanov, VT Todorova, G Georgiev, M Milanov

Emergency Hospital ‘Pirogov, Sofa, Bulgaria

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P84 (doi: 10.1186/cc12022)

Introduction Novel treatment strategies for invasive candidiasis (IC)
are constantly emerging. Nevertheless, difficulties in diagnosis pose
a challenge on their reliability, efficacy and safety. We have previously
developed and approbated in our ICU an algorithm for empirical
antimycotic therapy, combining the most significant risk factors for
IC with three major clinical criteria for persistent nonbacterial sepsis
[1]. On the other hand, preemptive therapy, based on identification of
mycotic antigens and/or anti-mycotic antibodies in serum, is regarded
as more reliable, even though it is known for its low sensitivity. The
aim of the current study was to compare and evaluate the possible
outcome benefit of our protocol implementation versus detection of
galactomanan in patient's serum as a trigger for antimycotic treatment
initiation.
Methods A randomized prospective controlled trial was carried out
from September 2010 to September 2012. After the implication
of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients were submitted to
block randomization and stratified on the basis of their initial SAPS
Il exp score. Antimycotic therapy was started on the day of inclusion
in the control group and only with positive galactomanan serum
test in the preemptive therapy group. Initial data were gathered on
demographics, proven risk factors for I|C-related mortality, severity of
inflammatory response and organ dysfunction. Dynamics of SIRS and
SOFA values, Candida colonization index, ventilator-free days, length of
ICU stay and outcome were followed for each patient.
Results A total of 106 patients were enrolled. No statistically significant
differences in their basal characteristics were found. The subsequent
SIRS and SOFA scores showed firm dynamics in the control group,
although the new organ dysfunction severity was insignificantly lower.
The length of ICU stay and the number of ventilator-free days were
comparable. The in-hospital mortality was 47.1% in the preemptive
therapy group versus 31.3% in the control group (P = 0.94). A total of
seven adverse reactions were observed among treated patients, yet
not associated with higher mortality risk.
Conclusion The choice of empirical versus preemptive therapy led to
earlier and more stable reduction in the degree of organ dysfunction
severity. It showed to be at least not inferior if not equal; in terms of
survival benefit and expediency of treatment. Moreover, galactomanan
detection fails to guide the choice of the individual antimycotic, based
on the expected Candida spp.

Impact of echinocandins as first-choice therapy in cardiothoracic
high-risk patients with candidemia

University of Cologne, Germany

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P85 (doi: 10.1186/cc12023)

Introduction Invasive candidemia is a major cause of increased
mortality among ICU patients. Antifungal agents like liposomale
amphotericin B and azoles could not accomplish the claim to be first
choice in the treatment of invasive fungal infection (IFl) because of side
effects and effectiveness. Especially, cardiothoracic surgery patients
as a group of high-risk patients are in a focus for new strategies
and agents. A new class of antimycotic agents, the echinocandins,
with a low profile of side effects, low interactive potential and high
effectiveness in the treatment of candidemia, is a powerful option in
the treatment of IFl. We report our single-center experience with a
modified clinical treatment approach based on clinical score of Leon
and using echinocandins as first-line therapy for proven and suspected
fungal infection.

Methods From May 2011 to October 2012, 2,844 patients were
treated on our cardiothoracic ICU. We evaluated 37 cardiothoracic
postoperative patients with proven or suspected IFl or prophylaxis
(Figure 1). The records were evaluated for cardiothoracic procedures,
microbiological and yeast date, cardiothoracic surgery score (CASUS),
ICU and clinical data.

Results Mean age was 67.4 years with 64% male patients. Most
patients had combined CABG and valve procedure (n = 20), other
groups were HTX and LTX (n = 4), assist therapy (n = 4), TAVI (n = 3)
and other procedures. Mean predicted mortality using the logarithmic
CASUS score at the onset of IFl was 59%. C. albicans was isolated in 73%,
C. glabrata in 21%. Length of antifungal treatment using micafungin in
30 cases was 14 + 5 days. Eradication of yeast was successful in 79%
but mortality of all patients remains high at 36.8% but was lower than
predicted in the CASUS score. Mortality was not yeast related.
Conclusion Our described treatment approach shows encouraging
results for the treatment of IFI especially in high-risk cardiothoracic
patients.

with fungi [1]. The relationship between colonization and invasive
fungal infection (IFI) in severely ill ICU patients with a VAD support is
not described. This study analyzes the incidence and outcome of fungal
infection and colonization in VAD patients in bridge to transplantation
or in destination therapy.

Methods We conducted a retrospective review of all VAD implantations
in our surgical ICU between 2007 and 2012. The incidence of fungal
colonization, antifungal prophylaxis, bacterial sepsis and the mortality
of IFl versus no IFI patients were compared.

Results In the study period, 34 patients with severe heart failure
or cardiogenic shock were selected for a VAD implantation (nine
in destination therapy). The overall mortality rate was 50% during
mechanical assistance. Confirmed (n = 8) and highly suspected (n = 2)
IFl occurred during the ICU stay in 29% of patients who were treated
with echinocandins, voriconazole and/or liposomal amphotericin B. The
isolated fungi were: six Candida albicans, two parapsilosis, one glabrata
and one invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Antifungal prophylaxis with
fluconazole was administered to 18% of patients at mean for 5 days
mainly in the more recent implantations. In the no IFl population,
54% (n = 13) had a systemic or VAD bacterial sepsis with a mortality
rate about 54%. The mortality without any sepsis was reduced to 18%.
Fungal colonization was significantly more present (90% vs. 50%)
before IFI in VAD patients. The mortality rate was dramatically higher
with IFI (80% vs. 38%) in accordance with the literature [1]. See Table 1.

IF | 10 9 8
P value 0.029 0.024

Conclusion In our center, we observed a high incidence of IFI in ICU
patients with VAD that was associated with a mortality rate of 80%.
Screening of fungal colonization appears to be very important during
the ICU stay for VAD patients. Trials are needed for investigating the
use, the drug choice and the timing of antifungal prophylaxis for such
high-risk patients.

Introduction Echinocandins are recommended first-line treatment
for candidaemia [1]. A cost-effectiveness model developed from a UK
perspective examined costs and outcomes of antifungal treatment
for candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis based on
European clinical guidelines [1].

Methods Costs and treatment outcomes with the echinocandin
anidulafungin were compared with caspofungin, micafungin,
fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B. The model included
non-neutropenic patients aged =16 years with confirmed candidaemia/
another form of invasive candidiasis receiving intravenous first-line
treatment [2]. Patients were categorised as a clinical success or failure
(patients with persistent/breakthrough infection); frequency data for
each outcome were taken from a mixed-treatment comparison [3].
Successfully treated patients switched to oral therapy. Clinical failures
switched to a different antifungal class. lt was assumed that second-line
treatment duration was equivalent to that of first-line treatment and
only two lines of therapy were required to treat infection. Other inputs

$32

were all-cause 6-week mortality, cost of treatment-related adverse
events (AEs) and other medical resource use costs. Life-years were
calculated using a published model [4]. Antifungal agent-related AEs
were taken from the product label/literature. Resource use was derived
from the literature and discussion with clinical experts. Drug acquisition/
administration costs were taken from standard UK costing sources.
Results First-line anidulafungin for treatment of candidaemia was
cost-effective per life-year gained versus fluconazole (incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio £813). Anidulafungin was cost saving versus
caspofungin and micafungin in terms of life-years gained due to
lower ICU costs and a higher rate of survival combined with a higher
probability of clinical success.

Conclusion Anidulafungin was _ cost-effective compared with
fluconazole for treatment of candidaemia and was cost saving versus
other echinocandins in the UK. European guidelines recommend
echinocandins as first-line treatments for candidaemia [1]; this
model indicates that anidulafungin marries clinical effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P88 (doi: 10.1186/cc12026)

Introduction Invasive fungal infections (IFI) affect 1% of ICU patients
and are increasing in incidence. IFls are associated with a poor
prognosis, which is further complicated by difficulties in identification
of fungal organisms by traditional culture methods and the emergence
of Candida species resistant to triazole therapy [1,2]. This study aimed to
assess the prevalence of IFls, the organisms responsible and outcomes
of patients affected.

Methods Patients admitted to the Heart of England NHS Foundation
Trust ICUs who acquired an IFI were identified through the hospital
Fungal Infection Risk Evaluation (FIRE) study database. All ICU patients
admitted between October 2009 and March 2011 were used as a
comparative cohort. Data collected included: baseline demographics,
length of stay, ICU and hospital mortality, and nature of IFl. Data were
analysed using Student's t test for continuous data and Fischer's exact
test for categorical data.

Results A total of 2,426 patients were admitted to Heart of England
NHS Foundation Trusts ICUs during the study period. Of these, 31
patients were identified as having an IFI (1.3%). Baseline demographic
data were similar between groups. Patients with IFI had significantly
longer ICU length of stay (19 days vs. 5 days, P <0.0001) and required
more days of advanced organ support (12 days vs. 3 days, P <0.0001).
A trend towards higher hospital mortality (41% vs. 27%, P = 0.08) was
observed. Candida albicans was the predominant organism cultured
(64%), followed by Candida glabrata (23%), with other Candida species
accounting for the remaining 13% of IFls. Sites of IFls were blood (45%),
intra-abdominal (39%), and pleural (16%). Most patients (52%) who
acquired an IFI had had intra-abdominal surgery prior to ICU admission.
The majority of patients (71%) were treated with echinocandins, whilst
of the nine patients who were initially treated with flucanazole, six
(67%) required therapy escalation to an echinocandin.

Conclusion The results of our study are consistent with other published
data, in that whilst IFl prevalence is low, they are associated with
increased morbidity in critically ill patients. This study has led to a
change in hospital policy regarding antifungal use in the ICU, with
echinocandins being first-line in the pre-emptive treatment of IFI. We
keenly await the results of the FIRE study, which will provide important
insights to identification of patients at risk of IFls and optimal drug
therapy.

Introduction The aim of this study was to compare self-reported beliefs
with actual clinical practice of oxygen therapy in the ICU. Hyperoxia is
frequently encountered in ventilated patients and prolonged exposure
has repeatedly been shown to induce lung injury and (systemic)
toxicity.

Methods An online questionnaire for ICU clinicians was conducted
to investigate beliefs and motives regarding oxygen therapy for
critically ill patients. Furthermore, arterial blood gas (ABG) samples
and corresponding ventilator settings were retrieved to retrospectively
assess objective oxygenation between 1 April 2011 and 31 March 2012
in the ICUs of three teaching hospitals in the Netherlands.

Results Analyzable questionnaire responses were received from 200
ICU physicians and nurses. The majority of respondents believed
that oxygen-induced lung injury is a concern, although barotrauma
and volutrauma are generally considered to impose a greater risk in
mechanical ventilation. Frequently allowed minimal saturation ranges
in the questionnaire were 85 to 95% and 7 to 10 kPa (Figure 1). Self-
reported FiO, adjustment in hypothetical patient cases with variable
saturation levels was moderately impacted by the underlying clinical
condition. To study actual clinical practice, a total of 107,888 ABG
samples with corresponding ventilator settings, covering 5,565 patient
admissions, were retrieved. Analysis showed a median (IQR) PaO, of
11.7 kPa (9.9 to 14.3), median FiO, was 0.4 (0.4 to 0.5), median PEEP was
5 (5 to 8). A total 63.5% of all PaO, registries were higher than previously
suggested oxygenation goals (7.3 to 10.7 kPa) [1]. In 56.8% of cases
with PaO, higher than the target range, neither FiO, nor PEEP levels
had been lowered when the next ABG sample was taken.

Conclusion Most clinicians acknowledge the detrimental effects of
prolonged exposure to hyperoxia in the ICU and report a low tolerance
for high saturation levels. However, the self-reported intention for
conservative oxygen therapy is not consistently expressed in our
objective data of actual clinical practice and a large proportion of
patients was exposed to high and potentially toxic oxygen levels.

FiO,/PEEP index: a simple tool for opitimizing ventilator settings

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P90 (doi: 10.1186/cc12028)

Introduction During mechanical ventilation, oxygenation can be
influenced by adjusting FiO, and positive end-expiratory pressure
(PEEP). There have been recommendations for how the FiO, and
PEEP should be set [1]. However, in a recent audit we found that the
compliance of doctors of these recommendations is very low [2].
Therefore we invented a simple parameter called the FiO,/PEEP index
(FPi) of which the physiologic value is <7 (that is, FIO, = 21%/PEEP =
3 cmH,O), which corresponds to the ARDSNet trial’s minimum FiO./
PEEP settings: 35%/5 cmH,O [2]. The aim of this case-control study
was to investigate the impact of an FPi <7 targeted protocol on clinical
practice.

Methods A prospective observational study in 2010 and 2012. Every
mechanically ventilated patient was recruited. Demographics, outcome
data and Lung Injury Score (LIS) were recorded after admission.
Respiratory settings, oxygenation and ventilation parameters were
recorded after mechanical ventilation was commenced and the first
arterial blood gas sample was taken (TO). Measurements were repeated
in 24 hours (T1). Data are presented as mean + SD, paired-sample and
independent-sample t test and chi-square tests were used for statistics.
Results In 2010, 75 patients, and in 2012, 130 patients were included.
There was no difference in demographics, disease severity, but LIS
was higher in 2012: 1.34 + 1.13 versus 0.84 + 0.98, P = 0.001. There
was no significant difference in FPi between the two groups at TO:
10.91 + 4.25 versus 10.26 + 5.01 (2012 vs. 2010, respectively). AtT24 the
FPi was significantly lower in 2012 as compared with 2010: 7.28 + 2.58
versus 8.17 + 3.3, P= 0.001; which was due to the higher PEEP applied:
7.08 + 2.87 versus 6.63 + 2.91, P= 0.014. Although in 2012 significantly
more patients, 112 (86%), were ventilated with FiO, =50% at TO as
compared with 2010, 44 (58%) (P = 0.001), by T24 significantly less
patients received FiO, >50%, 46 (35%) vs. 34 (45%) (P = 0.011). There
was no significant difference between the two groups regarding FiO,,
PaO, and PaCO, at TO and 124.

Conclusion Implementing an FPi <7-based algorithm significantly
reduced the FiO, and increased the PEEP applied in mechanically
ventilated within the first 24 hours. Whether this has any impact on
earlier weaning due to reaching the weaning criteria of FiO, sooner,
and as a result shortening the duration of mechanical ventilation, has
to be investigated in the future.

Use of high-flow nasal canulae: effect on alveolar pressure and its
limitation

Introduction High-flow nasal canulae (HFNC) deliver high-flow
humidified gas at up to 60 I/minute. There are two types of respiratory
circuit to generate mix gas flow, Blender type (typeB) and Venturi type
(typeV). The therapy is well established in the pediatric population
and HFNC use has been described in the adult population. It has been
reported that HFNC provide higher FIO, compared with low-flow
canulae, and also create mild positive pharyngeal airway pressure, but
the effect on alveolar pressure is unknown. We aimed to investigate
the effect of HFNC on alveolar pressure, by measuring intratracheal
pressure in patients with a cricothyrotomy catheter (CTC). At the same
time, we measured the actual gas flow rate (AGFR) by flowmeter and
compared it with assumed flow.

Methods Seven patients with a CTC were participated. A tube was
connected to the CTC and the tube was then connected to a pressure
transducer to measure intratracheal pressure. The HFNC (Optiflow

system) were applied with the humidifier to optimize humidication.
TypeB was used in three patients and typeV in four patients. The flow
was started at 10 I/minute. This flow rate was titrated upwards to a
maximum of 60 I/minute (10, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60 I/minute) and the AGFR
was measured. Intratracheal pressure tracing was done over 1 minute.
Airway pressure measurement was repeated and the maximal
expiratory pressure was measured in mmHg.

Results The AGFR in the respiratory circuit was almost same in typeB,
but there was obvious decrease in the AGFR in typeV (7.1 + 1.0,
17.7£0.8,21.9+0.9, 29.9 + 3.6, 36.9+ 2.7,45.0+5.5 I/minute at assumed
flow, 10, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60 I/minute, respectively). HFNC significantly
increased maximal expiratory pressure in both groups, 1.5 + 2.1,
2.0 + 1.0, 3.0 + 2.8, 4.5 + 3.5 mmHg for typeV and 2.5 + 0.7, 5.8 + 2.4,
6.0 + 2.8, 8.0 + 2.8 mmHg (maximum 10 mmHg) for typeB, when AGFR
was set at 30, 40, 50, 60 I/minute. Higher AGFRs were found to result
in larger increase in maximum expiratory pressure. The data indicate
that HFNC are associated with an increase in intratracheal expiratory
pressure. Because it was difficult to determine end-expiratory pressure,
we chose maximal expiratory pressure for a substitute. The reason why
AGFR in typeV was lower than assumed flow may be the resistance
generated by NC. The larger increase in expiratory pressure in our study
than previously reported may be due to the effect of high respiratory
resistance of Japanese who have relatively small airway structure
compared with western people.

Conclusion HFNC are effective in providing higher expiratory pressure.
It is important to know the flow rate is lower than expected when the
Venturi type is used.

Introduction Many authors have proposed less invasive ways to
measure oxygenation in patients with ALI. The aim of the present study
is to compare the already popular oxygenation index (Ol) and PaO./
FIO, ratio (PFr) with other recently proposed indices such as SpO,/FiO,
ratio (SFr) and ventilation ratio (VR) in a mixed ICU population.

Methods During a 6-month prospective observational study carried
out in a polyvalent 10-bed adult ICU, ABGs were obtained from 145
patients. Two independent measurements were taken from each
patient under the same mode of ventilation (SIMVPSV). PFr, SFr, VR
and OI were calculated. Demographic data (APACHE II score, age, sex,

diagnosis, body weight) were also recorded. Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test for normality was calculated followed by bivariate nonparametric
analysis (statistical significance: P <0.05).

Results A total of 290 measurements were included for further analysis.
Mean + SD values for age and APACHE II score were 61.2 + 16 years and
15.4 + 1.8, respectively, while median + SD values for PFr are 257 + 135,
for SFr 211 + 58, for Ol 4.8 + 4.46 and for VR 1.19 + 0.31. Relations
between PFr, SFr and Ol are displayed in Table 1.

PFr - 0.759* —0.939*
SFr - - —0.773*
*P <0.01.

Conclusion Our study identified a strong relation between PFr, SFr and
Ol but not VR. Thus, these markers may be used interchangeably as
bedside indices of oxygenation in critically ill patients. Yet larger studies
are needed to come to a safer conclusion.

Introduction Respiratory complexity (RC) as assessed by sample
entropy (SampEn) is lower in patients failing spontaneous breathing
trials. We evaluated the role of RC in monitoring subjects with severe
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) treated with the Cardiohelp
(Maquet, Rastatt, Germany) extracorporeal life-support system (ECLS).
We hypothesized that RC is reduced during apnea.

Methods Six sheep sedated with midazolam were connected to the
Cardiohelp via a 23F Avalon catheter. Blood flow was ~2 I/minute
and FiO, was 0.5. Sheep were on CPAP of 8 cmH,O with FiO, of 1 via
tracheostomy. After ~6 hours of ECLS, ARDS was induced by injection

of 0.1 ml/kg oleic acid. Apneas (defined as >60% reduction in minute
ventilation) developed both before (Preinjury) and after ARDS
(Postinjury). Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiratory
rate (RR) and tidal volume (TV) were recorded, and the PaO,:FiO, ratio
(PFR) calculated corresponding to sections of respiratory pressure
waveforms containing 200 breaths during Baseline, during Preinjury
and Postinjury apnea periods. Similar periods were selected before
and after apneas. Inter-breath interval (IBI) and its deviation, SampEn,
percentage of forbidden words (FW), bit per-word entropy (BPWEn),
symbol distribution entropy (DisNEn), and stationarity (StatAv)
were calculated using software. Statistics by one-way ANOVA with
adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Results See Table 1. SampEn was associated with PFR (r = 0.31,
P <0.001).

Conclusion Respiratory complexity during apnea and ECLS remains
unchanged in a healthy state but decreases after ARDS. It has a
significant association with PFR and may serve as an index of injury
severity.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome - the Berlin definition: impact
on an ICU of a university hospital

Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P94 (doi: 10.1186/cc12032)

Introduction The current definition of ARDS was established in 1994 by
the AECC. In 2011 emerged the Berlin definition. The aim of this study
was to find a new approach from the impact of ARDS in an ICU and to
analyze APACHE II score, days of mechanical ventilation (MV), duration
of ARDS and mortality.

Methods We analyzed the database of our ICU collected prospectively
from October 2008 to January 2011 and regarded all patients
undergoing MV for 48 hours or more and who met the AECC criteria. All
patients were ventilated according to the ARDSNet protocol.

Results During this period 1,900 patients were admitted, 607 were
under MV for at least 48 hours and 104 had ARDS criteria. Moderate
ARDS 60.6%: 60% male, median age 53 years, APACHE II mean 22.49
(95% Cl = 20.71 to 24.27), mean duration MV 23.84 (95% Cl = 18.08 to
29.60), ARDS duration 12.87 (95% Cl = 9.83 to 15.90), average stay 29.22,
mortality 52.4%. Severe ARDS 39.4%: 63% male, median age 45 years,
APACHE II mean score 23.19 (95% Cl = 20.62 to 25.75), mean duration
MV 18.52 (95% Cl = 13.01 to 24.03), ARDS duration 12.15 (95% Cl =
8.72 to 15.58), average stay 22.65, mortality 48.8% with no statistically
significant difference with moderate ARDS (P = 0.72). Leading cause of
death in both groups: multiorgan dysfunction (60%). See Tables 1 and 2.
Conclusion In this new approach of our ARDS patients we found no
statistically significant differences in relation to the variables of interest
to analyze in the two groups. Patients with severe ARDS who survive

Introduction We compared three different methods for diagnosing
pulmonary edema induced by weaning from mechanical ventilation:
the increase in extravascular lung water index (EVLWI), the increase
in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and blood volume contraction,
reflected by increases in plasma protein and in hemoglobin concen-
trations, all observed during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).
Methods We included 12 difficult-to-wean patients (22 recordings).
Before and at the end of a SBT (T tube), we measured pulmonary
occlusion arterial pressure (PAOP), EVLWI (PiCCO device), BNP, plasma
protein and hemoglobin concentrations. Weaning-induced pulmonary
edema was confirmed if a clinical intolerance to SBT was associated
with an increase of PAOP >18 mmHg at the end of SBT.

Results A weaning-induced pulmonary edema was diagnosed in 12
instances (PAOP significantly increased from 15.6 + 0.6 to 25.8 + 0.9
in these cases). EVLWI, BNP plasma protein and hemoglobin
concentrations significantly increased in these instances (28.3 + 5.7%,
20.2 + 7.8%, 9.6 + 0.8% and 9.3 + 1.3%, respectively) while they did not
significantly changed in cases without weaning-induced pulmonary
edema. The increase of EVLWI =8.5% (+1.5 ml/kg), an increase in
BNP >6.7% (+23 pg/ml), an increase in plasma protein concentration
>5% and in hemoglobin concentration >5% exhibited good areas
under the ROC curves to predict weaning-induced pulmonary edema
(0.97 + 0.03, 0.80 + 0.11, 1.0 + 0.00 and 0.92 + 0.05, respectively). These
areas under the ROC curves were not statistically different. The baseline
values of EVLWI, BNP, plasma protein and hemoglobin concentrations
did not predict weaning-induced pulmonary edema.

Conclusion The increases in EVLWI, in plasma protein and hemoglobin
concentration and in BNP are valuable alternatives to the pulmonary
artery catheter for diagnosing weaning-induced pulmonary edema.

Introduction The primary aim of this study is to assess the impact of
pressure support ventilation (PSV) on the rate of pneumothorax and
mortality in critically ill patients with lung injury. The secondary aim is
to evaluate pressure-volume (P-V) relationships. Soontaneous modes
of ventilation have been associated with lower rates of atelectasis,
less muscle atrophy, better airflow distribution and importantly lower
sedation requirements, which relates to lower mortality. Accordingly,
we hypothesized that the use of PSV in patients with moderate/severe
lung injury would have rates of pneumothorax and mortality within the
standard of care. We further hypothesized that given its spontaneous
nature, set pressures (PEEP and PS) but not tidal volume (Vt) would be
related to airway pressures.

Methods All adult patients admitted to two surgical/medical ICUs
subjected to invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) were enrolled.
Patients were stratified by Lung Injury Score (LIS) in two groups:
<2.5 (LISL); =2.5 (LISH). Exclusion criteria included pneumothorax on
admission, use of other ventilatory strategies, and inability to trigger
ventilation. Patients were ventilated with PSV, and treated only with
pro re nata haldol, morphine and clozapine. Airway pressures and

ventilatory mechanics were measured twice daily. Data are presented
as mean + 95% Cl. *P > 0.05.

Results A total of 166 patients with mean age 55 (52 to 58) years, LIS
of 2.27 (2.16 to 2.37) and MODS of 3.13 (2.9 to 3.3) were enrolled and
stratified by LISL (65.8%) and LISH (34.2%). Mortality, and incidence
of pneumothorax and atelectasis were 21% (14.9 to 28.2), 1.6% (0.8
to 3.1) and 6.4 (3.2 to 11.2). Duration of MV was 6 days (4.83 to 7.16).
Pneumothorax in LISL and LISH was 1% (0 to 5.2) versus 2.4% (0.7
to 6.1)*, and mortality 11.4% (3.8 to 24.6) versus 25% (9.8 to 46.7)*.
Mean parameters were: Vt 10.3 ml/kg (10.1 to 10.6); PEEP 10.6 (9.9 to
11); PS 16.6 (15.9 to 17.1); plateau pressure (Ppl) 25.7 (25.1 to 26.2).
Ppl was >26.2 only in 2.5%. PEEP and PS (P <0.0001), and MODS were
associated with Pplt, but not Vt* or LIS. Only lower Vt was associated
with barotrauma (OR = 0.996, P = 0.02).

Conclusion We demonstrate that PSV in minimally sedated patients
with severe lung injury is safe as it is associated with low incidence
of barotrauma, atelectasis and mortality, and with Ppl and duration
of MV within standard of care. We also demonstrate in PSV that P-V
relationships may differ and that in this setting higher Vt may not be
deleterious.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P97 (doi: 10.1186/cc12035)

Introduction The aim of this study is to compare two ventilation
strategies, the ARDSNet protocol and open lung management, using
computer control for 6 hours. The standard therapy for patients with
ARDS does typically apply a mechanical ventilator to support breathing.
The cost of therapy is high and it requires much attention from
physicians to adjust the proper ventilation settings in a timely manner.
A closed-loop ventilation concept has therefore been developed and
tested with two induced ARDS pigs.

Methods The hardware system is composed of a ventilator (Servo 300),
a spectrophotometry (CEVOX), a capnography device (CO2SMO+), an
electrical impedance tomography device (GOE MF Il) and a patient
monitor (Sirecust). The software is developed with Labview 7.1. With
approval from the ethical committee, two 27 kg pigs were exposed to
surfactant depletion with a warm saline washout to induce ARDS (PaO./
FIO, <200 mmHg). One pig model was ventilated with an automatic
ARDSNet protocol and another was automatically ventilated with open
lung management. Blood gas analysis (BGA) was carried out every half
an hour.

Results Artificial ventilation using the auto ARDSNet protocol success-
fully stabilized oxygenation, minimized plateau pressure (<30 cmH,0),
and controlled the pH value for acidosis and alkalosis management. On

the other hand, auto open lung management offers a distinctive result
of ventilation. A significant improvement of oxygenation and lung
compliance was observed within a few breaths after the recruitment
maneuvers. Both subjects were ventilated at the same tidal volume of
6 ml/kg and the comparative results of automatic ventilation settings
and BGA are provided in Table 1 for every 2 hours.

Conclusion The auto open lung management concept gave much
better gas exchange than the auto ARDSNet protocol. These
preliminary results showed a necessity to evaluate the two different
ventilation strategies. Therefore, further experiments with pig models
will be implemented in the near future to obtain results with statistical
significance and to ensure the safety of automation in a mechanical
ventilation system.

Introduction Intellivent-ASV has been developed to provide fully
closed loop mechanical ventilation using a ventilation controller keep-
ing EtCO, and SpO, within expert-based ranges. Ventilation of ARDS
patients focuses on delivering adequate oxygenation and allowing
elimination of CO, while protecting the lung. The objectives were to
compare Intellivent-ASV with conventional ventilation on safety and
efficacy, and to compare the number of manual adjustments between
the two ventilatory modalities.

Methods A randomized, controlled study including all consecutive
patients receiving mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours. Patients
were randomly ventilated either with Intellivent-ASV or conventional
ventilation, with a S1 (Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland). Parameters
were adjusted by the clinician in charge of the patient. Ventilatory and
oxygenation parameters were recorded cycle by cycle during 48 hours
and blood gases were performed every 6 hours.

Results Twenty-four patients with ARDS were included, 10 female, 14
male, median age 58 (46 to 63) years, APACHE II score 22 (17 to 29),
PaO,/FiO, at inclusion 136 (107 to 154). Eleven were ventilated in the
conventional group and 13 in the Intellivent-ASV group. The study was
stopped for one patient from the Intellivent-ASV group because of a
pneumothorax not caused by ventilation. The delivered Vt was slightly
higher during Intellivent-ASV (7.9 (7.5 to 8.5) vs. 7.2 (6.8 to 7.8) ml/kg,
P=0.013). The time spent by the various parameters in the suboptimal
zone (safety) is the same for the two ventilation modes. The time spent
in the optimal zone (efficacy) is the same for the two ventilation modes,

expect for SpO, (78% (75 to 89) with Intellivent-ASV vs. 44% (41 to 58),
P = 0.001). Intellivent-ASV required less manual adjustments during
48 hours (2 (0 to 7) vs. 17 (10 to 27), P <0.001). The total number of
adjustments during 48 hours, including automatic regulation, was
higher in the Intellivent-ASV group (379 (274 to 493) vs. 17 (10 to 27),
P <0.001).

Conclusion Over 48 hours, Intellivent-ASV allowed safe ventilation for
ARDS patients, with better oxygenation and an identical ventilation
efficacy when compared with conventional ventilation, with less
manual adjustments.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P99 (doi: 10.1186/cc12037)

Introduction ARDS is characterized by increased pulmonary capillary
permeability secondary to diffuse alveolar inflammation and injury.
Common risk factors can be classified into two groups: extrapulmonary
causes (indirect etiologies: ARDSexp) or pulmonary causes (direct
etiologies: ARDSp). There are few quantitative methods to distinguish
between the differences in these two ARDS categories.

Methods A subanalysis of the trial by the PiCCO Pulmonary Edema
Study (prospective, observational, multi-institutional study) in 23 ICUs
of academic tertiary referral hospitals in Japan. All consecutive adult
patients requiring mechanical ventilation with the diagnosis of ARDS
were monitored by the transpulmonary thermodilution technique
system (PiCCO; Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) for 3 days:
day 0, day 1 and day 2. The pulmonary vascular permeability index
(PVPI), extravascular lung water index and intrathoracic blood volume
index were measured concurrently. Three experts retrospectively
determined the pathophysiological mechanism causing ARDS by
patient history, clinical presentation, chest computed tomography and
radiography. Patients were classified into two groups: patients with
ARDS triggered by ARDSexp and ARDSp.

Results During the study period from March 2009 to August 2011, a
total of 173 patients were assessed including 56 ARDSexp patients
and 117 ARDSp patients, with the most common cause of ARDSexp
secondary to sepsis (71%) and of ARDSp pneumonia (80%). The
measurement of PVPI was significantly elevated in the ARDSp group
on all days. There were no significant differences in mortality at 28 days,
mechanical ventilation days, and hospital length-of-stay between the
two groups, while the ARDSexp group seemed to be associated with
prolonged mechanical ventilation days and hospital length-of-stay.
Conclusion This study suggests the existence of several differences
in pathogenetic pathways and the degree of pulmonary permeability
between patients with ARDSexp and ARDSp. We therefore believe that
using the PVPI may provide us with timely quantitative information to
make clinical decisions.

Introduction The injury of alveolar epithelium and endothelium is the
basis of pathogenesis for the early stage of acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS). A prompt detection of this injury will provide us
with a possibility for early ARDS diagnosis and treatment. Currently
no biomarkers of alveolar epithelial injury are clinically available. The
purpose of our study was to investigate the role of surfactant protein D
(SPD) and Clara cell protein (CCP) as biomarkers of early ARDS.

Methods This observational study in ICU mechanically ventilated septic
patients with intra-abdominal surgical infections was carried out at the
V.A. Negovsky Research Institute of General Reanimatology in 2010
to 2012. ARDS was diagnosed and staged according to the research
institute criteria [1] and the American-European criteria. Plasma
concentrations of SPD and CCP were measured on ARDS diagnosis
(day 0) and days 3, 5, and 7 by immunoenzyme essay (Bio Vendor, USA).
Data were statistically analyzed by STATISTICA 7.0, ANOVA method,
and presented as mean + o, ng/ml. P <0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Areas under the receiver operating curves (ROC) were
calculated.

Results Fifty-five patients (out of 250 screened) were enrolled according
to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients were assigned into groups:
ARDS (n = 30; subgroups - ARDS stage 1 (n = 15), stage 2 (n= 15)) and
noARDS (n = 25). In the ARDS group SPD was higher at all points than
in the noARDS group (day 0 — 352.5 + 287.8 vs. 141.0 + 103.4; day 3 -
278.6 + 204.8 vs. 151.8 + 125.9; day 5 - 339.9 + 331.4 vs. 162.3 + 138.8;
day 7 — 339.9 + 300.1 vs. 169.8 + 154.5; P <0.05). SPD levels were lower
at ARDS stage 1 in comparison with stage 2 (day 0 - 154.6 + 125.2 vs.
451.8 + 299.2; day 3 - 129.3 + 74.9 vs. 362.9 + 202.0; day 5 - 167.8+ 120.4
vs. 428.5 + 372.4; day 7 - 186.2 + 127.1 vs. 415.5 + 337.0; P <0.05).
Plasma SPD had a good diagnostic capacity for stage 1 ARDS: SPD on
day 0 <253.0 ng/ml yielded a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 74%
(AUC = 0.83; 95% Cl = 0.631 to 0.951; P = 0.0001). No such differences
for CCP were detected.

Conclusion Plasma SPD level <253.0 ng/ml is a sensitive and specific
biomarker of the early stage of ARDS in septic patients.

Introduction Emulsified perfluorocarbons (PFC) are synthetic hydro-
carbons that can carry 50 times more oxygen than human plasma. Their
properties may be advantageous in applications requiring preservation
of tissue viability in oxygen-deprived states [1,2], making them a
potential candidate for combat and civilian prehospital resuscitation.
Our hypothesis is that an intravenous dose of PFC increases vital organ
tissue oxygenation, improves survival after hemorrhagic shock (HS)
and may reduce or prevent the development of ventilator-associated
ARDS. Here we report data from the first part (HS only) of a multiphase
swine study to study the benefits of PFC in treating HS and preventing
ARDS. This initial study was designed to ensure safe use of PFC in
traumatized animals.

Methods Anesthetized Yorkshire swine were hemorrhaged 55% of their
estimated blood volume (Time 0 (TO)) over 15 minutes. AtT15 minutes,
pigs received a bolus of the PFC Oxycyte or 10% hydroxyethyl starch
(HES). At T60 animals underwent continuous hemorrhage (0.5 cm?/kg/
minute) until death. Time to death and physiological parameters were
primary endpoints.

Results Average survival time after onset of second hemorrhage
was 60 minutes in PFC-treated animals versus 65 minutes in the HES
group. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was similar between TO and T60,
thereafter PFC-treated animals had lower MAP, mean pulmonary artery
pressure (MPAP), heart rate and cardiac output (P >0.05).

Conclusion There was no significant difference in survival time, MAP
and MPAP in the PFC group compared with HES control. These data
suggest that it is safe to administer in this HS model. Regulatory
approval of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers has been halted due to
possible side effects related to vasoconstriction. In this model, and with
this class of oxygen-carrying drugs (PFCs), we did not observe evidence
of vasoconstriction. Using PFCs did not result in a survival advantage
here; however, there was also no observation of adverse events. Based

on these data we will continue to the next phase of this project and

test PFC in the prevention of ARDS alone, and in combination with HS.

Introduction The role of the D allele of the angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) gene I/D polymorphism in the clinical outcomes of
patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ALI/ARDS) remains controversial. We assessed simultaneously the
effect of the ACE I/D polymorphisms as well as the serum and BALF ACE
levels on prognosis of ARDS patients.

Methods We recruited 69 mechanically ventilated ALI/ARDS patients.
ACE activity levels in serum and BALF were assessed by chemical
methods. Patients were genotyped for ACE I/D polymorphisms. Time-
to-event analysis evaluated the variables associated with the 28-day
and 90-day mortality.

Results In the multivariable model, age, lung compliance, serum lactate
and serum ACE levels were significantly associated with both 28-day
and 90-day mortality. No significant correlation was found between
serum and BALF ACE levels (Spearman's p = 0.054; P = 0.66). Serum
ACE concentrations were significantly higher (P = 0.046) in patients
with D/D genotype versus the two other groups combined (I/D and
I/| genotypes). A meta-analysis of six studies (including ours) provided
evidence that the D allele is significantly associated with increased
mortality in ALI/ARDS patients, yielding a per-allele odds ratio of 1.76
(95% Cl: 1.19 to 2.59). See Figure 1 and Table 1.

Conclusion Serum ACE levels appear to be affected by the I/D poly-
morphism and are correlated with prognosis in patients with ALI/ARDS,
indicating that further investigation of the clinical significance of the
ACE in ARDS might be of value.

Introduction No recommendations available concerning protocols of
static PV loop and esophageal pressure measurements use set positive
end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The aim of the study was evaluation
of the significance of the lower inflection point (LIP) and esophageal
pressure monitoring for PEEP adjustment in ALI and ARDS.

Methods A prospective study performed in one general ICU. We include
72 patients who received mechanical ventilation before evaluation
and met ARDS criteria by AECC (1994) — acute onset, PaO.,/FiO, lower
than 250 Torr, bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. Exclusion criteria were
age <15 years and pregnancy. We drew a static pressure-volume loop
with sustained inflation 40x30 (PV loop) for all patients using a low-
flow technique (Hamilton G5) and measured the esophageal pressure
(Avea) in 36 of 72 patients. After that PEEP was set according to zero
end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure. We compare PV loop data
with esophageal pressure measurements.

Results The low inflection point median was 8 (95% Cl = 5 to 10.5)
mbar, which does not correspond to the empirically set optimal PEEP
of 13 (95% Cl = 12 to 15) mbar (P <0.001, Wilcoxon test). End-expiratory
esophageal pressure (EEEP) median was 14 (95% Cl = 12 to 18) mbar,
the correlation between LIP and EEEP was poor (p = 0.279, P = 0.049).
We find significant correlation between static compliance and EEEP
(0 = -0.421, P = 0.005). Sustained inflation did not lead to improved
oxygenation (P >0.05). PEEP adjustment by EEEP led to an increase in
PaO,/FiO, — median 107 mmHg (95% Cl = 18 to 147, P <0.001). EEEP was
similar to empirically set PEEP (P >0.05).

Conclusion LIP has poor correlation with EEEP. PEEP adjustment by
esophageal pressure was close to empirically set PEEP and can improve
oxygenation.

manoeuvres (Sigh) introduced during pressure support ventilation
(PSV) improve oxygenation, probably by increasing end-expiratory
lung volume (EELV). We assessed Sigh effects on regional distribution
of EELV by electrical impedance tomography (EIT): a bedside, radiation-
free lung imaging technique. Moreover, we investigated baseline
characteristics correlated with response to Sigh.

Methods We enrolled 20 intubated critically ill patients undergoing
PSV with PaO,/FiO, <300 mmHg and PEEP =5 cmH.0O. We applied on
each patient’s thorax a 16-electrode belt connected to an EIT monitor
(PulmoVista 500°; Drager Medical GmbH, Lubeck, Germany). Sigh was
introduced as 35 cmH,O continuous positive airway pressure phase
lasting 3 to 4 seconds at different rates (0, 0.5, 1, 2 per minute, random
order) for 20 minutes. From raw EIT data, we calculated global changes
in EELV (AEELVgl), calculated as changes in end-expiratory lung
impedance calibrated versus tidal volume to estimate changes in AEELV
and considering 0 Sigh/minute as baseline; and AEELV of nondependent
and dependent lung regions (AEELVnondep and AEELVdep). Together,
we collected ventilation parameters, hemodynamics and arterial blood
gases.

Results Patients were 65 + 13 years old, ventilation days were 9 + 10
and PaO,/FiO, was 194 + 49 mmHg at PEEP 8 + 2 cmH,O. Introduction
of Sigh improved PaO,/FiO, (P <0.001) and AEELVg! (P <0.001).
The increase in EELV was diffuse across all lung regions as both
AEELVnondep and AEELVdep changed (P <0.01 and P = 0.06). minute
ventilation, arterial blood pH and hemodynamics were not significantly
affected by introduction of Sigh, while mean airway pressure increased
(P <0.001), albeit only at the highest Sigh rate and by a limited extent
(~2 cmH,O). Patients with mean AEELVgI over the three Sigh phases
>200 ml (that is, Sigh-responders) had significantly lower PaO,/
FiO, values at baseline (that is, at Sigh rate = 0/minute) than Sigh-
nonresponders (163 + 25 mmHg vs. 222 + 39 mmHg, P <0.01).
Conclusion Introduction of Sigh in intubated critically ill patients
undergoing PSV improves gas exchange by inducing alveolar
recruitment across all lung regions with minimal increase of airway
pressure. Patients with more severe gas exchange impairment present
the highest degree of potentially recruitable lung.

Introduction Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is a well-known side
effect of mechanical ventilation. The pressures and volumes needed
to induce VILI in healthy animals are far greater than pressure and
volumes applied in clinical practice [1]. A possible explanation may be
the presence of local pressure multipliers (stress raisers).

Methods We retrospectively analyzed CT scans of 147 patients with
ARDS and CT scans of 100 healthy subjects. A homogeneous lung
would have the same gas/tissue ratio in all its regions. If a lung region
expands less than the neighbour regions these will be more strained
to vicariate the non/less expanding region. We measured the stress
raisers by computing the ratio between the gas fraction of the region
of interest and the neighbouring regions: if the inflation would be the
same (homogeneity), the ratio will be equal to one; if the inflation of the
surrounding regions would be greater than the region of interest (that
is, more strained), the ratio between the two will be greater than one

$39

and was taken as a measure of stress raiser. We considered pathological
stress raisers as the regions showing inflation ratio greater than the
95th percentile of the control group (1.61) and defined as the extent
of the stress raisers the fraction of lung volume above this threshold.
Results The extent of stress raisers increased with the severity of
ARDS (14 + 5, 18 + 8, 23 + 1% of lung parenchyma in mild, moderate
and severe ARDS, P <0.0001). The extent of stress raisers correlated
with the dead space fraction (r? = 0.34, P <0.001), with the fraction
of poorly aerated tissue (r* = 0.36, P <0.0001) and also has a negative
correlation with the fraction of well inflated tissue (r’ = 0.47, P <0.0001).
The response to PEEP, passing from 5 to 45 cmH,0O is minimal (average
decrease of stress raiser extent 6 + 5%) and inter-individual variability
is great (in 11 patients, stress raisers increased passing from PEEP 5 to
PEEP 45). Stress raisers turn out to be greater in nonsurvivor patients
than in survivor patients (17 + 7 vs. 20 + 9% of lung volume, P = 0.03).
Conclusion Stress raisers correlate with the severity of disease; lungs
with greater stress raisers are subjected to higher local pressures and
probably those patients are more susceptible to VILI. The application of
PEEP has little effect on stress raisers.

Introduction Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is commonly
used in patients with ARDS to prevent end-expiratory collapse. The
increase in gas volume and/or change in mechanical properties of
the lung are used at the bedside to estimate lung recruitment and
individualize PEEP selection.

Methods Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent whole-
lung CT scan at 5 and 15 cmH,O PEEP. Every chest CT was divided both
into 10 apex-base levels of equal height and into 10 sterno-vertebral
levels, yielding 100 units per scanned lung (200 units per patient);
each unit was classified according to its average CT number (<-100
not inflated, -100 to -500 poorly inflated, -500 to -900 well inflated
and -900 overinflated). Lung regions defined as not inflated at PEEP
5 cmH,O and inflated (poorly, well or over) at PEEP 15 cmH,O were
classified as recruited. Moreover, a surrogate specific lung compliance
(CLsp) was determined on the expiratory limb of the pressure-volume
curve (15 to 5 cmH,O PEEP at CT) and was defined as Agas/cmH,O
PEEP/gram of tissue.

Results We included in our study the CT scans of 89 patients (24 mild,
55 moderate and 10 severe ARDS, age 58 + 17 years, BMI 25.6 + 5.4,
PaO,/FiO, 165 + 66, PaCO, 42 + 9, 60 discharged alive from ICU
(67%)). At PEEP 5 cmH,O 39 + 16% of the lung parenchyma was not
inflated, 33 + 13% poorly inflated, 28 + 15% well inflated and 0 + 1%
overinflated. The median lung recruitability between 5 and 15 cmH,O
PEEP was 6% (3 to 10%) of lung parenchyma (71 g (26 to 182 g)). Mean
EELV at PEEP 5 cmH,O was 1,233 + 709 while it increased to 1,784 + 848
at PEEP 15 cmH,O (AEELV = 551 + 407 ml). More than one-half (52% (31
to 75%)) of the increase in end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) was due
to an increase in inflation of the already well-aerated tissue; 38% (23 to
43%) was due to the inflation of poorly aerated tissue, while only 4%
(1 to 8%) to the recruitment of lung tissue. The CLsp of the well, poorly
and recruited tissue was 0.07 (0.031 to 0.13), 0.03 (0.01 to 0.06) and 0.02
(0.01 to 0.04) ml/cmH,O/g, respectively (P <0.0001).

Conclusion Most of the PEEP-related EELV increase is due to an
increased inflation of already well aerated lung tissue. In agreement
with the baby lung theory [1], the well-aerated tissue showed near to
normal mechanical properties.

Introduction Several strategies can be applied for the prevention and
management of anesthesia-related hypoxemia. The aim of our study
was to investigate the cardiovascular effects of a specific recruitment
maneuver (RM) used for the management of intraoperative hypoxemia.
Methods Forty-nine patients (29 male/20 female) of mean age
57.4 + 9.9 years, mean weight 80.2 + 13.6 kg and ASA-PS classification |
to IV (I: 2, Il: 27, Ill: 16, IV: 6), undergoing general surgery procedures, who
developed intraoperative hypoxemia (PaO.,/FiO, <200), were enrolled
in our study. For the management of hypoxemia a total of 67 RMs
have been applied, which consisted of a manual increase of the airway
pressure to 40 cmH.0O. This rise has been maintained for 10 seconds and
was followed by an increase of positive end-expiratory pressure from 5
to 10 cmH,O. Before RM application an oesophageal Doppler monitor
probe was inserted into the patients for measuring stroke volume (SV),
cardiac output (CO), peak velocity (PV) and flow corrected time (FTc).
Standard monitoring also included EGG, IBP, ETCO, and SpO.,. Heart rate
(HR), systemic arterial pressure (SAP), SV, CO, PV and FTc were recorded
directly before, during, right after and 5 minutes after RM application
(T1 to T4). Kolmogorov-Smirnoff was used to test normal distribution
of data and ANOVA was used for the statistical analysis. P <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Results HR, SAP, SV, CO, PV and FTc showed a statistically significant
decrease during and right after RM compared with the baseline
values but they were gradually restored to control values after RM
discontinuation (Table 1).

Conclusion According to our results, RM application causes a profound
impairment of the cardiovascular system. This can be attributed to the
increase of the airway pressures, which results in preload decrease
and afterload increase of the right ventricle and cardiac contractility
attenuation. Nevertheless, these effects are transient and reversible
and RM application is a safe technique for the management of
intraoperative hypoxemia, provided that adequate cardiac preload is
ensured and the anesthesiologist is alert to discontinue the RM if it
exceeds cardiovascular reserves.

Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Pisana, Pisa, Italy

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P108 (doi: 10.1186/cc12046)

Introduction To investigate the haemodynamic effects of an alveolar
recruitment manoeuvre in intubated patients with diastolic dysfunction
compared with patients with normal diastolic function in a mixed ICU.
Methods Between October 2011 and February 2012, 16 mechanically
ventilated patients admitted to the ICU with normal systolic function

S40

and without inotropic support were enrolled. A transthoracic echo-
cardiography was performed to assess diastolic function: E/A, isovolumic
relaxation time (IVRT), deceleration time (DT), E/e’ were assessed. Eight
patients (five with poor relaxation pattern, three with decreased left
ventricle compliance) were identified in diastolic dysfunction group
(Group 1) and eight were included in the normal diastolic function
group (Group 2). A recruitment manoeuvre was performed by applying
a PEEP of 40 cmH,0 for 30 seconds. Haemodynamic parameters of
cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR), pulse pressure
variation (PPV), and cardiac cycle efficiency (CCE) were continuously
recorded during the manoeuvre using the MostCare pulse contour
method.

Results No significant haemodynamic changes happened in the first
part of the recruitment (tO to t15 seconds). A significant decrease in
CO (P <0.05), SV (P <0.01), systolic pressure (P <0.04) and PPV (P <0.04)
occurred in Group 1 during the remaining part of the manoeuvre. No
significant decrease in the same haemodynamic parameters were
noted when only E/A was used to discriminate the diastolic dysfunction.
See Table 1.

Table 1 (abstract P108). CO difference associated with diastolic dysfunction
parameters

E/A <1 E/A>1 Pvalue
CO 15 to 30 3.9 48 0.20
E/e’<] E/e'>1
CO 15 to 30 3.92 5.6 0.02

Conclusion The recruitment manoeuvre can compromise left diastolic
filling by increasing the transpulmonary pressure. In patients with
diastolic dysfunction a significant decrease in SV can be observed
during the recruitment manoeuvre with no compensatory mechanisms
evoked determining a significant decrease in CO. The E/A ratio is not
able to discriminate between the two groups, confirming the power of
tissue Doppler imaging to recognize the correct diastolic pattern.

Introduction The aim of the ongoing Alveolar Recruitment for ARDS
Trial (ART) is to evaluate whether a maximum stepwise alveolar recruit-
ment maneuver (MSARM) followed by ventilation at optimal PEEP may
decrease 28-day mortality in patients with moderate to severe ARDS
compared with ventilation with the ARDSNet strategy (NCT01374022).
Here we report the results of a planned a priori preliminary analysis
involving 100 patients to assess feasibility, physiologic variables and
safety outcomes.

Methods ART is an event-driven multicenter randomized controlled
trial planned to last until 520 deaths within 28 days are observed.
Patients assigned to the experimental group receive a MSARM
achieving PEEP of 45 cmH,O and plateau pressure of 60 cmH,O plus
PEEP titrated according to the static compliance of the respiratory
system (ART strategy). The target tidal volume is 4 to 6 ml/kg predicted
body weight (PBW) and plateau pressure <30 cmH,0O in both groups.
Results We randomized 101 patients between November 2011 and
October 2012 in 51 centers. Considering 124 active sites in July 2013
and the current recruitment rate, we will finish enrollment by November
2014. MSARM was complete in 34/47 (72%) of patients allocated to the

----$$$$----$$$$----
Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2
http://ccforum.com/supplements/17/S2

ART group. The main reason for MSARM interruption was hypotension
(8/9 (90%)). Mean titrated PEEP in the ART group was 16.1 + 3.5 versus
12.9 + 3.4 cmH,O in ARDSNet (P <0.001). One hour after randomization,
tidal volume was similar between the ART and ARDSNet groups
(5.1 + 0.8 vs. 5.3 + 0.7 ml/kg PBW, respectively; P = 0.08). Mean values
remained below 6 ml/kg PBW up to day 3. Few patients had plateau
pressure >30 cmH,O 1 hour after randomization in the ART and
ARDSNet groups (3/43 (7.0%) vs. 4/47 (8.5%), respectively; P= 1.00) and
on subsequent days. PaO,/FiO, was significant higher in the ART group
(179.5 + 84.5 vs. 143.3 + 46.8, P = 0.01) and increased over time up to
7 days after randomization (272.3 + 136.5 vs. 192.6 + 72.3, P = 0.003).
The ART strategy did not increase the risk of barotrauma (relative risk
(RR) = 0.78, 95% Cl = 0.19 to 3.30) in the first 7 days after randomization
or the need to initiate or increase vasopressors or mean arterial
pressure <65 mmHg (RR = 1.14, 95% Cl = 0.65 to 2.02, P= 0.67) 1 hour
after randomization. However, the ART strategy increased the risk for
severe acidosis (pH <7.10) 1 hour after randomization (RR = 3.20, 95%
Cl = 1.12 to 9.20, P= 0.03).

Conclusion ART is feasible. The incidence of adverse events was similar
between groups except for severe acidosis 1 hour after randomization.
Hence we adjusted the study protocol, increasing the respiratory rate
(from 10 to 15/minute) during MSARM.

Introduction Cardiac surgical procedures are associated with a high
incidence of postoperative complications, increasing costs and
mortality. The purpose of this study is to evaluate prospectively the
impact of two protective mechanical ventilation strategies, both using
low-tidal volume ventilation (6 ml/kg/ibw) after cardiac surgery.
Methods We prospectively evaluated 270 patients immediately after
cardiac surgery, presenting hypoxemia and PaO,/FiIO, <250. Patients
were randomized to an intensive alveolar recruitment maneuver (ARM)
or a moderate ARM strategy. Intensive ARM group: recruitment with
an inspiratory pressure amplitude of 15 cmH,O and PEEP of 30 cmH,0O,
followed by ventilation with PEEP = 13 cmH,O, during 4 hours of
protective mechanical ventilation with VT = 6 ml/kg/pbw. Moderate
ARM group: recruitment with opening pressures of 20 cmH.O in the
airways, followed by ventilation with PEEP = 8 cmH,0, during 4 hours of
protective mechanical ventilation with VT = 6 ml/kg/pbw. The primary
outcome was a composite endpoint of severe pulmonary complications
in the postoperative period defined as intra-hospital death, need for
mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours after surgery, pulmonary
infection or after reintubation within 28 days after randomization. The
secondary outcome was the incidence of nonpulmonary complications
as postoperative myocardial ischemia, acute renal failure (RIFLE-R),
respiratory mechanics and blood gas analysis after ARM, ICU length of
stay, hospital length of stay and 30-day mortality.

Results The intensive ARM group compared with the moderate ARM
group had lower incidence of the primary outcome, mainly due to
the reduced rate of pulmonary infection (2.3% vs. 10.1%, P = 0.009).
Moreover, the intensive ARM group presented higher lung compliance
(68 + 19 vs. 51 + 17 ml/cmH,O, P <0.001) and PaO./FiO, ratio (360 + 68
vs. 240 + 74, P <0.001) after intervention when compared with the
moderate group. Also, the intensive ARM presented a lower length of
ICU stay (3 days vs. 4 days, P= 0.027) than the moderate ARM. There are
no differences regarding severe nonpulmonary complications and 30-
day mortality between groups.

Conclusion An intensive ARM strategy reduces postoperative pulmo-
nary complications, reduces hypoxemia, increases lung compliances
and decreases the length of ICU stay after cardiac surgery.

Reliability of pressure measurements via balloon catheters is high:
an evaluation of six esophageal catheters

S Walterspacher, L Isaak, HJ Kabitz, J Guttmann, S Schumann

University Medical Center Freiburg, Germany

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P111 (doi: 10.1186/cc12049)

Introduction Reliable measurement of esophageal pressure is a
prerequisite for analysis of respiratory system mechanics in spontaneous
breathing patients. For that purpose, various types of balloon catheters
exist that differ in material, size and shape. In physical models we
studied the quality of pressure measurement via six different balloon
catheters, three of them containing a second balloon for measurement
of gastric pressure.

Methods Nine balloons of six esophageal catheters were investigated
in three conditions: measurement of balloon pressure during initial
inflations immediately after unpacking; measurement of static pressures
at different filling volumes; and compliance estimation in physical
models (27, 54, 90 ml/cmH,O) at different levels of superimposed
pressure.

Results During the initial inflation most catheters showed pressure
artifacts resulting from material adhesion. Those artifacts disappeared
during following inflations. Static pressure measurements could
be performed with an error below 1 cmH,0 if the balloon was filled
appropriately. Overfilling of the balloon resulted in larger errors only in
two catheters. Compliance estimations resulted in errors below 1 ml/
cmH,O. Superimposed pressure had no relevant effect on compliance
estimation.

Conclusion The reliability of pressure measurements and also of
compliance estimation via the tested catheters is high. Only in
two catheters was the filling volume a critical point for a precise
measurement of pressure or for estimation of compliance. Immediately
after unpacking, adhesion of the balloon material might prevent
reliable pressure measurement, therefore before the first measurement
overfilling of the balloon and retention of the excess gas seems strongly
recommended.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P112 (doi: 10.1186/cc12050)

Introduction Low tidal volume (VT) ventilation in intensive care
patients without lung injury attenuates the systemic inflammatory
response [1]. The contribution of the specific organ inflammatory
responses to the systemic picture remains to be elucidated. We
investigated the effect of low VT ventilation compared with medium
high VT on hepatic, splanchnic and cerebral cytokine responses in an
experimental large animal postoperative sepsis model.

Methods Twenty pigs, group Protective Ventilation (PV), were ventilated
with low VT (6 ml/kg) and PEEP 10 cmH,O while 10 pigs, group Control
(C), were ventilated with a VT of 10 ml/kg and PEEP 5 cmH,O. Catheters
were introduced into an artery, the jugular bulb, the hepatic vein and
the portal vein. Laparotomy for 2 hours simulated a surgical procedure
after which baseline ensued and a continuous endotoxin infusion was
started at 0.25 ug/kg/hour for 5 hours. Differences were analyzed with
ANOVA for repeated measures.

Results TNFa levels were higher in the hepatic vein than in the artery,
the jugular bulb and the portal vein. IL-6 levels were higher in the
artery and the jugular bulb compared with the portal and hepatic
veins. IL-10 levels were higher in the portal vein compared with the
jugular bulb and hepatic vein. The organ-specific IL-10 concentrations
were all higher than the arterial concentration. Comparison between
the ventilation groups showed that TNFa, IL-6 and IL-10 in the hepatic
vein were higher in group C compared with group PV at the end of
the experiment. Peak concentrations of TNFa and IL-6 in the portal vein
were higher in group C compared with group PV.

Conclusion In this experiment TNFa was mainly generated in the
liver while the results point to significant nonhepatic IL-6 and IL-10
production. Ventilation with low VT and medium-high PEEP attenuated
hepatic and splanchnic cytokine production compared with medium-
high VT and lower PEEP.

Introduction Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is fundamental
to prevent lung collapse in ARDS patients. A common method to
titrate PEEP is to perform a PEEP test, recording the variation of cardio-
respiratory parameters after a PEEP change [1]. The aim of this study
was to evaluate the time-course changes of gas exchanges following
a PEEP test.

Methods Mechanically ventilated patients (PEEP 10 cmH,O and TV
7 ml/kg —- Baseline) were randomized to two groups: in the PEEP 15
group, PEEP was increased from 10 to 15 cmH,O; while in the PEEP 5
group, PEEP was decreased from 10 to 5 cmH.O. Arterial gas analyses
were performed in both groups after 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes from the
change of PEEP.

Results We enrolled 44 ARDS patients: 23 in the PEEP 15 group and 21
in the PEEP 5 group. At Baseline, PaO,/FiO, (P/F) and PaCO, were similar
in both groups (P/F 169.5 + 78.8 vs. 165.4 + 80.6; PaCO, 45.6 + 8.5 vs.
41.7 + 5.0 mmHg, PEEP 15 vs. PEEP 5, respectively). In the PEEP 15
group, P/F significantly continuously increased over time. In PEEP 5,
P/F significantly decreased after 5 minutes and remained stable over
time. In the PEEP 15 group, PaCO, did not change within 60 minutes
after PEEP increase. When PEEP was reduced (PEEP 5) PaCO, remained
stable for the first two steps, while at 30 and 60 minutes PaCO, was
significantly higher than at Baseline (Figures 1 and 2).

Conclusion Our data indicate that it is important in critically ill
patients to allow sufficient time for the full effect of PEEP increase on
oxygenation and to prevent excessive delay when P/F decrease occurs
following the application of a lower level of PEEP.

Introduction Quantitative analysis of a lung CT scan is considered
the reference method to study lung recruitability to optimize the
ventilatory strategy in ARDS patients. However, CT implies a risk of
radiation exposure, especially when CT analysis is necessary to monitor
the evolution of ARDS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact
of a lower radiation dose on lung CT quantitative analysis compared
with analysis computed by standard CT.

Methods Sedated and paralyzed patients underwent two chest CT
scans: a Standard CT (120 kV, 110 mAs, pitch 1.2, collimation 0.6 mm;
Care Dose Technology) and a CT performed by a lower radiation dose
(Lowdose: 120 kV, 60 mAs). CTs were performed during the same
inspiratory or expiratory hold, for different values of airway pressure.
Each CT image was manually delineated excluding pleural effusions
and mediastinal structures. We analyzed Standard and Lowdose CT
images with dedicated software to quantify the tissue weight of
lung regions with different degrees of inflation. Lung quantitative
data computed by Standard and by Lowdose scans were compared
according to Bland-Altmann analysis.

Results We enrolled 13 patients admitted to our ICU. In the Bland-
Altman analysis of the lung total tissue and not inflated tissue, the
bias and agreement bands for Standard CT scan and Lowdose CT
quantitative analysis were -16.97 g (—77.43 to +43.49 g) and -9.65 g
(-116.81 to 77.51 g), respectively (Figures 1 and 2).

Conclusion Lung CT quantitative analysis computed by Lowdose
CT scans could be a useful tool for monitoring and ventilatory
management of ARDS patients.

Preliminary experience with airway pressure release ventilation on
hemodynamics in patients with septic shock in a medical/surgical
ICU

A Hussain, H Lababidi, A Mir, A AlHamoud, A Al Oheli, A Al Enezi

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P115 (doi: 10.1186/cc12053)

Introduction Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) allows
spontaneous breathing throughout the ventilation cycle. It increases
venous return and cardiac index, which will significantly improve
organ perfusion. This is important in septic shock patients to prevent
extrathoracic organ system failure secondary to poor perfusion.
Benefits of APRV with cardiovascular changes are noticed in patients
with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. It is
not well established whether applying APRV will improve the survival
outcome for septic shock patients. The primary outcome is whether the
use of APRV in septic shock patients restores hemodynamic stability
earlier than the CMV mode. The secondary hypothesis is whether the
use of APRV in septic shock patients improves their survival in the ICU.
Methods After Institutional Review Board approval, we retrospectively
analyzed the clinical data of 129 septic shock patients who received
ventilator support between January and December 2011 at a tertiary
care hospital. The Cox proportional hazards model was used in
adjusting potential confounding factors. The nonparametric Wilcoxon
rank sum test was used to assess significant outcome differences
between groups. Time to event/survival data will be analyzed using
Kaplan-Meier methods. These analyses were accomplished using SAS,
version 9.3.

Results Among the 187 patients, 58 were excluded as per the exclusion
criteria: incomplete data (n = 28), do not resuscitate (n = 16), ICU
readmission (n = 12) and head injury (n = 4). Finally, 129 patients were
included, from these 91 received CMV and 38 received APRV. At the
beginning of the study, there were no differences between the groups
in relation to hemodynamic parameters. Reversal of shock achieved
in less than 72 hours was statistically significant between the groups
(APRV, n = 16 (42%) and CMV, n = 8 (9%), P = 0.0101). The proportion
of patients recovering from septic shock after initiation of ventilator

S43

therapy was higher in APRV than the CMV group (72% vs. 49%,
respectively, P <0.0001). The mortality rate was significantly higher in
CMV (n = 46, 51%) as compared with APRV (n= 11, 29%) (P = 0.022).
Conclusion The use of APRV in septic shock patients restores
hemodynamic stability earlier than the CMV mode. There was a
significant improvement in ICU survival using APRV over CMV. Early
initiation of APRV in ventilated septic shock patients was associated
with a decrease in ICU mortality.

Montpellier University Hospital, Montpellier, France

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P116 (doi: 10.1186/cc12054)

Introduction Obese patients are at risk of developing atelectasis and
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1]. The prone position
(PP) may reduce atelectasis, and improves oxygenation and outcome
in severe hypoxemic patients in ARDS [2], but little is known about its
effect in obese ARDS patients.

Methods Morbidly obese patients (body mass index (BMI) =35 kg/m*) in
PP with ARDS (PaO,/FiO, ratio <200 mmHg) were matched to nonobese
(BMI <30 kg/m?) ARDS patients in a case-control clinical study. The
primary endpoints were safety and complications of PP; the second
endpoints were the effect on oxygenation (PaO,/FiO, ratio at the end
of PP), length of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, nosocomial
infections and mortality.

Results Between January 2005 and December 2009, 149 patients were
admitted for ARDS. Thirty-three obese patients were matched with
33 nonobese patients. Median PP duration was 9 (6 to 11) hours in
obese patients and 8 (7 to 12) hours in nonobese patients (P = 0.28).
We collected 51 complications, of which 25 in obese patients and
26 in nonobese patients. The number of patients with at least one
complication was similar across groups (n= 10, 30%). The PaO./FiO, ratio
(Figure 1) increased significantly more in obese patients (from 118 + 43
to 222 + 84 mmHg) than in nonobese patients (from 113 + 43 mmHg
to 174 + 80 mmHg, P= 0.03). Length of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay
and nosocomial infections did not differ significantly, but mortality at
90 days was significantly lower in obese patients (27 vs. 48%, P <0.05).

Introduction During the influenza pandemic of 2009, clinicians
delivered mechanical ventilation to pregnant women with little
evidence to guide practice. The objective of this study was to compare
the provision of mechanical ventilation to pregnant/postpartum
women and a nonpregnant matched control group admitted to the
ICU with H1N1 influenza.

Methods A case-control study was conducted following ethics
approval. A case was defined as a ventilated pregnant/postpartum
woman reported to the Australian and New Zealand INFINITE H1N1 09
study from 1 June 2009 to 31 August 2009. Controls were ventilated
nonpregnant women (15 to 49 years) reported to the INFINITE H1N1
09 study during the same time frame. Data were entered into SPSS
and analysed using nonparametric statistics; two-tailed P <0.05 was
considered significant.

Results We studied 36 index cases and 38 controls. Index cases were
more likely to have a single arterial blood gas (ABG) taken prior to
intubation (P <0.05). Similar reasons were given for the trigger to
intubate (high respiratory rate, low PaO,, increased work of breathing)
apart from a high PaCO,, which was a trigger in the control group only
(P <0.05). There were no differences in the pre-intubation and post-
intubation ABGs apart from a lower PaCO, (P <0.05) and lower HCO,
(P <0.05) in cases, and cases presented with a lower haemoglobin
(P <0.05). There were six difficult intubations documented with no
differences between groups. Initial ventilator settings including mode,
tidal volume, minute volume and respiratory rate demonstrated no
differences. Both groups showed increases in PaO, and PaCO,, and
a decrease in pH from the pre-intubation to post-intubation ABGs
(P <0.05).

Conclusion There were physiological differences between the two
groups with pregnant/postpartum women showing lower PaCO, and
HCO,. However, initial ventilator support was not significantly different
for pregnant/postpartum women compared with controls.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P118 (doi: 10.1186/cc12056)

Introduction The objective is to analyze the epidemiology and
mortality of critical burn patients with inhalation injury.

Methods A prospective, observational and descriptive study was
carried out in all patients admitted to an ICU from October 2008 to June
2011. Inhalation injury was defined with two or more of the following
criteria: history of injury in an enclosed space, facial burns with singed
nasal hair, carbonaceus sputum or stridor. If they were intubated it
was diagnosed by bronchoscopy. Demographic data, length of stay,
ABSI, APACHE II, duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital course
and mortality data were collected. Data are presented as number and
percentage or as median and interquartile range and were analyzed
with the Fisher exact test and Mann-Whitney test.

Results Of the 362 patients admitted, 84 (23.2%) had inhalation injury.
Seventy-six percent were male and the average age was 52 (+ 17.5)

S44

years. The mean total burn surface area (TBSA) was 28% (+ 25). Forty-
five patients (53.5%) had TBSA >20%. These patients had higher severity
scores: ABSI 8 (+ 2.8) versus 6 (+ 2.2) (P = 0.0001), APACHE II 13 (+ 6.9)
versus 7 (+ 6.7) (P= 0.0001). They also had a higher need for mechanical
ventilation (88.1% vs. 34.9%, P = 0.001) and shock (59.5% vs. 27.0%, P=
0.001). The PaO,/FiO, ratio at admission with and without inhalation
was 245 versus 359 (P = 0.003), and at 72 hours was 207 versus 306
(P = 0.002). There were no significant differences in the appearance
of sepsis, ARDS and renal failure. The length of stay with and without
inhalation was 25.2 (1 to 95) days versus 22.5 (1 to 92) days (P= 0.4). The
inhalation injury group showed a significantly higher mortality (9.0%
vs. 28.9%, P = 0.001).

Conclusion In this study, inhalation injury is common in burn patients.
They had higher severity scores (APACHE II, ABSI) and higher mortality.
These patients had a higher need for mechanical ventilation and
lower PaO,/FiO, ratio, but there was no significant increase in ARDS or
respiratory sepsis.

Beneficial effects of intrapulmonary percussive ventilation in
patients with respiratory insufficiency in the ICU

| Blum, R Janssen-Dean, A Overdijk van, B Speelberg

St Anna Hospital Geldrop, Geldrop, the Netherlands

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P119 (doi: 10.1186/cc12057)

Introduction Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) is a therapy
that is used to clear endobronchial secretions. The IPV ventilator was
designed and developed by FM Bird in 1979. The ventilator consists
of a phasitron that delivers rapid, high-flow, mini bursts of oxygen,
mixed with air. The potential aims of this mechanism are pulmonary
recruitment, improved mucus clearance with a direct high-frequency
oscillatory effect. We investigated whether IPV has a positive effect on
ventilatory values in adult patients on the ICU.
Methods All patients presenting during a 4-month period in 2011 with
respiratory insufficiency on our mixed adult ICU were included in this
study. Patients were monitored before, directly after and 15 minutes
after therapy with IPV using a Bird Intrapulmonary Ventilator Model
IPV-2C. All patients received IPV for a period of 20 minutes consisting
of two cycles of 10 minutes. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO.), tidal
volume (Vt), respiratory rate, end-tidal CO, (ET-CO,), dynamic lung
compliance (C-dyn) and work of breathing (WOB) were monitored
at the different time points. Paired Student t tests were performed in
order to compare the values immediately before IPV, with directly after
therapy and 15 minutes later. P <0.05 was considered significant.
Results Eighty-three patients were examined. SpO, improved signifi-
cantly from 93.7 + 3.7 before IPV to 95.7 + 2.8 after IPV (P <0.001) and
15 minutes later to 95.2 + 2.8 (P <0.001). Vt improved from 418 + 111
before IPV to 476 + 102 directly after (P <0.001) and to 480 + 131
15 minutes later (P <0.01). Respiratory rate improved from 24 + 6 to
23 + 6 only after 15 minutes significantly (P <0.01). WOB and C-dyn did
not change. ET-CO, decreased from 34.9 + 14.8 to 33.3 + 13.3 (P <0.05)
directly after IPV and to 32.1 + 12.8 (P <0.01) 15 minutes later.
Conclusion In this study we demonstrated a beneficial effect of IPV on
oxygen saturation, tidal volume and end-tidal CO.,. IPV has this effect in
addition to the mobilization of bronchial secretions.

high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) was considered mostly
a rescue therapy.

Methods Fifteen adult patients admitted to our ICU for acute
traumatic and nontraumatic lung injury were submitted to HFOV when
conventional mechanical ventilation failed.

Results Clinical and demographic data are shown in Table 1. Figure 1
shows the trend of gas parameters during the recovery. At baseline
PaO, was 94 + 28 mmHg; after 6 hours of HFOV: 135 + 41 mmHg,
P <0.01. At baseline PaO,/FIO, was 182 + 97 mmHg; after 6 hours of
HFOV: 264 + 101 mmHg, P <0.01. The benefits are maintained when
returned to conventional ventilation.

Conclusion HFOV may therefore be anticipated to improve end-
organ perfusion and gas exchange; it should be considered in severe
traumatic and nontraumatic respiratory failure [1].

Improvement in oxygenation with high-frequency oscillatory
ventilation combined with tracheal gas insufflation is correlated to
the extravascular lung water index

Evaggelismos General Hospital, Athens, Greece

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P121 (doi: 10.1186/cc12059)

Introduction High-frequency oscillatory ventilation combined
with tracheal gas insufflation (HFO-TGI) can significantly improve
oxygenation in patients with ARDS. It has been demonstrated that
oxygenation in patients with ARDS has a better response to HFO when
extravascular lung water is >15 ml/kg body weight (BW). Our aim is to
examine whether the extravascular lung water index (ELWI) correlates
with changes in PaO,/FiO, in patients ventilated with HFO-TGI.

Methods Data from 18 sessions of HFO-TGI in six patients were included
in the analysis. HFO frequency, oscillatory pressure amplitude, and bias

flow were 3.5 Hz, 85 to 95 cmH.,0O, and 40 I/minute, respectively; a 2.5 to
3.5 cmH.O tracheal tube cuff leak was used. HFO mean airway pressure
(mPaw) exceeded preceding conventional ventilation (CV)-mPaw by
7 to 13 cmH,O. PaO,/FiO,, lung mechanics, and hemodynamics were
documented during lung-protective CV (baseline) and 1 hour following
the initiation of HFO-TGI ventilation. PULSION PICCOplus v7.0 was used
for hemodynamic measurements including the ELWI.

Results Oxygenation (PaO,/FiO,) improved significantly with HFO-
TGI compared with CMV (125.5 + 54.7 vs. 195.6 + 108.7, P <0.001).
Changes in PaO./FiO, were positively correlated with ELWI at baseline
(Spearman’s p = 0.56, P= 0.016). See Figure 1. There were no significant
changes in patients’ fluid balance and hemodynamics including the
ELWI.

Conclusion Estimation of the ELWI can help to predict the oxygenation
response of ARDS patients considered for HFO-TGI ventilation. The
possibility that HFO-TGI exerts an effect on pulmonary oedema needs
further investigation.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P122 (doi: 10.1186/cc12060)

Introduction Protective mechanical ventilation (MV) in ARDS is based
on reduced stretch of pulmonary tissue, sometimes resulting in severe
hypoventilation that can be avoided when using high respiratory rate.
High-frequency positive-pressure ventilation (HFPPV) has not been
fully explored, especially when associated with other strategies aiming
to avoid hypercapnia.

Methods We induced ARDS in eight pigs by lung lavage with saline
plus 3 hours of injurious MV with low PEEP and high driving pressure
(DP). We then performed a recruitment maneuver (RM) followed
by PEEP titration using the amount of alveolar collapse in electrical
impedance tomography (EIT). Then stabilization during 1 hours with
tidal volume (VT) at 6 ml/kg, respiratory rate (RR) 35 breaths/minute
and PEEP selected with the PEEP-FiO, table (ARMA study), which was
kept constant during two steps of HFPPV with a RR 60: one without
an inspiratory pause (HFPPV-60), and one with a pause of 30% of
inspiratory time (HFPPV-60 w/P30%). In another HFPPV step, we used
PEEP titrated with EIT after RM (HFPPV-60 w/RM). During each HFPPV
step, VT was set to reach a PaCO, of 60 + 3 mmHg. Distribution of
regional ventilation was analyzed using EIT. Equilibrium was considered
if PaCO, was stable (<5% of variation) for >30 minutes.

Results HFPPV allowed reduction in PaCO, levels: 81 (77, 94) versus
60 (58, 61), 59 (58, 60), 60 (58, 61) mmHg, besides using lower VT:
5.2 (5.0, 5.9), 5.1 (4.5, 6.0), 4.7 (4.2, 5.7) and 4.8 (4.5, 5.6) ml/kg during
stabilization, HFPPV-60, HFPPV-60 w/P30% and HFPPV-60 w/RM,
respectively. It had no significant different results comparing HFPPV-60
with and without an inspiratory pause. HFPPV-60 w/RM allowed a
better alveolar homogenization and improvement in oxygenation,
shunt, dead space and DP compared with the other steps. See Table 1.

Conclusion HFPPV with a conventional mechanical ventilator is able
to maintain stable PaCO, in clinically acceptable values, allowing

further physiologic benefits in a severe ARDS model.

Introduction High-frequency percussive ventilation (HFPV) is a rescue
technique for most severe acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) patients [1], especially with smoke inhalation or
respiratory burns [2]. This study aimed at characterizing HFPV as
delivered by Percussionnaire VDR4° and at evaluating how hypobarism
interferes with HFPV, in order to assess its usability at altitude.

Methods Using a mechanical test lung mimicking ARDS (compliance
17 ml/cmH,O) with two resistance levels (5 and 15 cmH,O/I/second)
and ventilated with VDR4° in a hypobaric chamber, ascents/descents
between 0 and 5,000 and then 0 and 8,000 ft were performed. Adjustable

S46

VDR4® parameters were modified one at a time at each altitude. Besides
these parameters (cross-measured with standalone hardware), oxygen
consumption of the respirator and three calculated parameters were
studied: low-frequency tidal volume (Vt, integrated from instantaneous
flows measured with a Fleisch pneumotachograph), end-inspiratory
(PmEl) and end-expiratory (PMEE) mean pressures. PmEI and PmEE in
HFPV reflect plateau pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure in
conventional ventilation. The correction of altitude-induced offset with
the modification of working pressure was also tested.

Results Data displayed by VDR4° overestimated pulmonary pressures
by more than 10%, but were reliable for other parameters. During
ascent, an offset appeared for all respiratory parameters: Vt increased
by 59% and PmEl by 53% between 0 and 8,000 ft. During descent,
the offset was reversely directed with a 39% decrease in Vt and a 28%
decrease in PMEE between 8,000 and 0 ft. Modifying working pressure
adequately corrected PmEl and PmEE, but not Vt. In all cases, manually
correcting VDR4° parameters to their 0 ft level also corrected these
offsets. Multivariate analysis further established that, adjusting for
other parameters, Vt, PmEI and PmEE did practically not depend on
altitude. Oxygen consumption of the respirator was high, 25 I/minute
at 0 ft, and stable with altitude. It was reduced with percussive rate and
with FiO...

Conclusion HFPV can be safely used at altitude, provided that VDR4°-
displayed parameters are used to manually adjust settings in order to
avoid exposing patients to volutrauma or barotrauma during ascent,
and to major hypoventilation and alveolar collapse during descent. The
high oxygen consumption is currently the main limit to its use for long-
range aeromedical evacuations.

Recruitable volume is comparable in acute respiratory distress

Introduction The application of PEEP is commonly used in acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and has been shown to improve
oxygenation. To identify patients that most benefit from the application
of PEEP, the discrimination of recruiters and nonrecruiters has been
postulated by Gattinoni and colleagues [1]. Recently, Dellamonica and
colleagues [2] presented a method to predict alveolar recruitment.
We hypothesised that the amount of recruitable volume allows the
discrimination between ARDS patients and patients with healthy lungs
(HL).

Methods We recalculated the recruited volume (RV) in 25 patients
with ARDS [3] according to the method proposed by Dellamonica and
colleagues during an incremental PEEP manoeuvre (PEEP increased
until the plateau pressure reached 45 cmH,O). RV was calculated as the
change in end-expiratory lung volume minus total respiratory system
compliance times the PEEP change (RV = AEELV - CTOTXAPEEP).
For comparison, 12 patients with HL undergoing elective surgery in
general anaesthesia were measured using the same protocol.

Results Both ARDS and HL patients exhibited typical P-V curves and
stepwise recruitment (Figure 1). By raising PEEP from 0 to 12 cmH,O,
ARDS patients recruited 331 + 195 ml (mean + SD) and HL patients
435 + 43 ml. There was a strong correlation (R? = 0.88) of the total RV
with the end-inspiratory volume at a plateau pressure of 45 cmH,O in
both groups; that is, recruitment was found to the same extent in both
groups (Figure 2).

Conclusion The relative contribution of RV to lung volume gain is similar
in ARDS and in patients with healthy lungs. Our results question the
relevance of recruitability as defined by Dellamonica and colleagues as
a typical phenomenon of ARDS, but support the baby lung concept, as
the recruited volume was closely related to the size of the lung.

Nosocomial bloodstream infection and venovenous extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation: a retrospective cohort study

B Serra de Oliveira, S Mendes Fernandes, C Franca

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P125 (doi: 10.1186/cc12063)

Introduction Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(VV-ECMO) for respiratory failure in the ICU is used in a variety of
clinical situations and has been demonstrated to significantly improve
survival without disability in adult respiratory distress syndrome [1].
ECMO has been presented as a risk factor for bloodstream infection
although recently published data do not support this view or the use
of antibiotic prophylaxis [2]. We aimed to examine VV-ECMO as a risk
factor for nosocomial bloodstream infection.

Methods A retrospective cohort study from patients admitted to
our ICU between April 2009 and June 2012. We compared incidence
rates of nosocomial bacteremia using the Hospitals in Europe Link for
Infection Control through Surveillance (HELICS) between general ICU
and VV-ECMO patients and used multiple logistic regression analysis to
control for possible confounders.
Results During the study period 1,146 patients were admitted and 16
received VV-ECMO. The incidence of bloodstream infection in patients
with ECMO was 19/1,000 exposure-days versus 4,9/1,000 exposure-
days in general ICU patients (incidence rate ratio of 3.82; 95% Cl: 2.0
to 7.3; P <0.001). Bacteremia was mostly due to Gram-negative agents
(65%). The patients with bloodstream infections under ECMO (n =
10) had a nonsignificant younger age (P = 0.08) and a lower SAPS II
score (P = 0.03) compared with non-ECMO patients (n = 25). VV-ECMO
patients had a significantly higher risk of primary bacteremia than non-
ECMO patients (P = 0.04). Patients with bloodstream infections in the
VV-ECMO group had a lower crude mortality rate (OR: 0.1, P= 0.04), not
confirmed in the adjusted analysis. There were no crude or adjusted
differences in the time to bacteremia or infections due to multiple
drug-resistant microorganisms (OR: 0.26; P = 0.085) between groups.
Conclusion This study suggests that VV-ECMO patients have a
significantly higher risk for primary nosocomial bloodstream infection.
A larger study is needed to confirm such findings and to assess the
need for specific intervention, namely routine antibiotic prophylaxis.

Introduction aPTT is a common tool for anticoagulation monitoring
during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Thrombo-
elastography (TEG) is another available option in this setting.

Methods A prospective observational study on 12 consecutive
patients during venovenous ECMO. Anticoagulation was provided

with unfractioned heparin titrated to an aPTT ratio target of 1.5 to 2.
Kaolin-activated TEG (K-TEG) was contemporarily measured but did not
guide heparin infusion. Baseline K-TEG reaction time (R) >20 minutes
is accepted for anticoagulation but when it exceeds 90 minutes
anticoagulation may be too great [1].

Results Mean ECMO duration was 9 + 4 days. A total of 152 K-TEGs were
collected. Comparison between aPTT and K-TEG R is reported in Table 1.
Four patients (33%) had hemorrhagic complications. Neither aPTT
nor K-TEG R were significantly different in patients with hemorrhagic
events compared with patients without hemorrhagic events but the
latter received a significantly lower total heparin dose (P = 0.0097).

Conclusion The use of ECMO in patients with severe respiratory failure

Introduction The usefulness of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(ECMO) is being rediscovered in the wake of the pandemic of H1N1
influenza. However, it has been reported that patients who received
ECMO often developed virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome
(VAHS), compared with those without ECMO support. Although
there is ample evidence that extensive cytokine activation is a key
factor in VAHS, ECMO itself could be a potential trigger to exacerbate
the pathology by amplifying cytokine activation. In this study, we
investigated whether mediators such as cytokines may be produced
by ECMO.

Methods Patients with severe respiratory failure who were placed
on ECMO were enrolled between June and July 2012. This study was
approved by the ethics committee. Blood specimens were drawn from
the blood circuit at the inlet of the centrifugal pump (before) and
outlet of the hollow fiber oxygenator (after) at a frequency of three
to four times per day. Blood IL-18, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10,
IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFNy, MCP-1, MIP-18, and TNFa
were measured globally using a multiplex cytokine bead array system
(Bio-Plex; Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan). HMGB1 was measured using an ELISA
kit (Shino-Test, Tokyo, Japan).

Results Two patients with interstitial pneumonia were studied. The
ECMO system consisted of a Rotaflow Centrifugal Pump (Maquet Japan,
Tokyo, Japan), a Biocube TNC coating 6000 (NIPRO, Osaka, Japan), and
a percutaneous cardiopulmonary support system (Capiox EBS; Terumo,
Tokyo, Japan). The blood flow rate was 2.0 + 4.0 I/minute. A total of 34
blood sets were collected. In most cases, blood levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-
4, IL-5, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17, GM-CSF, IFNy, and TNFa were below the
detection limit and did not increase during ECMO. The other mediators
were detected at the inlet (before), but no significant increase was
observed at the outlet (after) (HMGB1, P = 0.33; IL-6, P = 0.12; IL-7, P=

Introduction During severe exacerbation of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) tachypnea, as a consequence of respiratory
acidosis, and airflow limitation, due to small airway obstruction, lead to
lung hyperinflation, respiratory distress and gas exchange impairment.
Invasive mechanical ventilation could worsen lung hyperinflation
and produce a vicious circle. We investigated whether increasing
extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO, Cl) could reduce
the respiratory rate (RR), so prolonging time for lung emptying and
allowing resolution of hyperinflation.

Methods Six patients with COPD exacerbation with respiratory acidosis
(PaCO, 83 + 27 mmHg, pH 7.19 + 0.1) and tachypnea (RR 39 + 5)
despite maximal non-invasive ventilation underwent venovenous
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). All patients were
awake and spontaneously breathing an adequate air—oxygen mixture
to correct hypoxemia (PaO, 72 + 27 mmHg). While keeping the blood
flow stable (2.9 + 0.5 |/minute), we changed the gas flow of the artificial
lung to modify the extracorporeal CO, clearance as a percentage of
total patient CO, production (% ECCO, Cl/total VCO.) and we observed
the variations of RR. We recorded RR at three levels of gas flow in each
patient (Figure 1).

Results In all patients RR decreased with the increase of extracorporeal
CO, removal and a negative correlation was found between RR and
ECCO, Cl/total VCO, (r? = 0.42, P <0.01). In all patients we were able to
obtain a reduction of RR below 15 (28 + 4 vs. 8 + 4, RR at low gas flow vs.
RR at maximal gas flow, P <0.001). The selected maximal gas flow was
variable between different patients (6.7 + 2 |/minute), corresponding to
different levels of ECCO, Cl/total VCO, (83 + 17%, range 53 to 100%) and
RR response (8 + 4, range 5 to 14).

Conclusion In patients with COPD exacerbation, who failed non-
invasive ventilation, VV-ECMO allows one to maintain spontaneous
breathing. Titration of extracorporeal CO, removal leads to control
RR. This approach could interrupt the vicious circle of dynamic
hyperinflation and allow the deflation of lung parenchyma.

ECCO, removal with a phosphorylcholine-coated membrane
oxygenator in difficult respiratory weaning patients

F Turani, S Martini, A Marinelli, M Falco, R Barchetta, F Candidi, F Gargano
‘Aurelia Hospital/European Hospital, Rome, Italy

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P129 (doi: 10.1186/cc12067)

Introduction ECCO, removal may be a useful support in patients
with difficult respiratory weaning. The aim of this study is to evaluate
a new phosphorylcholine-coated EECO, removal system with no
thrombogenic activity to assess the clinical safety of the system, the
changes of main cardiorespiratory indices and CO, removal by the
system.

Methods Ten patients were enrolled. Before starting with ECCO,
removal all patients were ventilated with TV <6 ml/kg, peak pressure
>35 cmH,O and pH <7.25.ECCO, removal was initiated using a modified
continuous venovenous hemofiltration system with a membrane
oxygenator (ABYLCAP; Bellco, Mirandola, Italy; membrane surface
area: 0.67 m?, blood flow 280 to 350 ml/minute, phosphorylcholine
coated). Femoral vein cannulation with a double-lumen catheter was
used to connect the patients to the extracorporeal system. Heparin was
infused to maintain ACT <190 to 240 seconds. All patients had ECCO,
for 4 days. Every 12 hours the pH, PaCO., peak pressure and PaO, were
evaluated. VCO, was determined by indirect calorimetry using a gas
analyser equipped on an Engstrom Carestation Ventilator. During the
ECCO, removal the patients were ventilated with TV <6 ml/kg and peak
pressure <30 cmH.O. All data are expressed as mean + SD. One-way
ANOVA was used to compare the changes of parameters. P <0.05 was
considered significant.

Results Table 1 presents the main results. The CO, removal by mem-
brane oxygenator ranged from 56 to 37 ml/minute. All patients
survived to the treatment and 7/10 were weaned from the ventilator
at the end of ECCO, removal. Only one oxygenator was used for every
patient without clotting of the circuit or any major bleeding problem.

Lung elastance can be determined without esophageal pressure
measurements

C Grivans, S Lundin, O Stenqvist

Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P130 (doi: 10.1186/cc12068)

Introduction We have previously shown, in an ex vivo porcine model,
that lung elastance calculated as the PEEP change divided by lung
volume increase (APEEP/AEELV) is closely correlated to conventionally
measured lung elastance using oesophageal pressure [1]. In this study
we hypothesize that the successive change in lung volume during
a PEEP-step manoeuvre could be predicted from APEEP and lung
elastance as APEEP/EL. The objective of the study was to validate this
hypothesis in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF).

Methods Thirteen patients with ARF were studied during an incremental
PEEP trial, O-4—8-12-16 cmH,O. AEELV was determined as the change
in expiratory tidal volume following each PEEP step. Conventional
calculation of lung elastance was obtained from tidal variation in airway

pressure minus tidal variation in oesophageal pressure divided by tidal
volume. Position of the oesophageal catheter was verified according
to Baydur [2]. The measured change in end-expiratory lung volume
during the PEEP-step manoeuvre using spirometry was compared
with the end-expiratory lung volume change calculated from EL and
stepwise changes in PEEP as APEEP/EL.

Results There was a close correlation between the measured build-up
of end-expiratory lung volume during a PEEP-step manoeuvre and
APEEP/EL where EL was conventionally determined using oesophageal
pressure measurements (See Figure 1).

Conclusion Esophageal pressure measurements are difficult to perform
[3] and rarely used in routine clinical practice. Our findings indicate that
a change in PEEP together with measurements of the resulting change
in end-expiratory volume by spirometry in the ventilator could be used
to determine lung elastance separately, the relation between lung and
chest wall elastance as well as the transpulmonary pressure.

Feasibility of minimally invasive stimulation of the phrenic nerves
for supporting ventilation in fully anesthetized swine

‘Regions Hospital, St Paul, MN, USA; ?Respithera, Bloomington, MN, USA
Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P131 (doi: 10.1186/cc12069)

Introduction Long-term use of mechanical ventilators may lead to
ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD) and increase the
duration of weaning from MV [1]. It was hypothesized that stimulating
the diaphragm during MV may prevent VIDD and may lead to early
weaning [2]. In this study, the feasibility of generating coordinated
contraction of both diaphragms was investigated using a novel
transvenous diaphragmatic pacing system.

Methods Two juvenile pigs were anesthetized with propofol (150 to
250 ug/kg/minute) and ventilated (VENT) with an assist control mode
MV (Nellcor Puritan Bennett 840). Using fluoroscopy, a novel multipolar
neurostimulation catheter (Inspirx RL PICC53; Respithera, Bloomington,
MN, USA) was threaded into the left internal jugular vein and advanced
to the junction of right atrium and the superior vena cava using a

modified Seldinger technique. The successful capture of the right
and left phrenic nerves was confirmed by fluoroscopic visualization.
Peak airway pressures (PAWP) and blood gases were determined after
10 minutes MV (MV), MV and stimulation applied together (MV+STIM)
and stimulation only (STIM).

Results No animal-ventilator dyssynchrony during stimulation
(MV+STIM) was noted while peak airway pressures were reduced.
During STIM there was no discernible paradoxical movement of
the diaphragm. In addition, PCO, and PO, confirmed that adequate
ventilation and oxygenation can be provided by the system, while
PAWP could be reduced (Table 1).

Conclusion It was possible to capture and stimulate both phrenic
nerves using a minimally invasive approach to support respiration
and sustain blood gases at physiological levels. This development
could help wean MV-dependent ICU patients earlier. Further long-term
studies are needed to assess the full potential of this novel system.

Introduction Respiratory failure in COPD patients is a frequent call
in French emergency dispatching centers. We have evaluated the
prehospital management of COPD patients and severity signs, and
analyse outcome in the emergency department or ICU.

Methods We conducted an observational, descriptive, retrospective,
single-center study during a 4-month period. All COPD patients with
respiratory failure and prehospital care were included. Different data
were recorded.

Results Ninety patients were included (77% male, 23% female). Mean
age 69 years (+ 11.88). Fifty-five percent were smokers, 52% had
arterial hypertension, 39% received long-term oxygenotherapy, 18%
received antibiotics in the 7 days before, 18% corticosteroids, and
14% were on long-term NIV support at home. An emergency medical
ambulance was immediately sent for 86% of patients. Ninety-two
percent had normal consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale 15), 78%
had bronchospasm, 71% had signs of respiratory struggle, and 12%
were unable to speak. The mean respiratory rate was 31.4 cycles/
minute (+ 8.18), the average cardiac pulse was 103.6 beats/minute
(+ 23.14). Nasal EtCO, 44.92 mmHg (+ 16.38), pulse oximetry with air
was 83.48% (+ 12.09), and the average flow rate of oxygen delivered
was 5.69 I/minute (+ 2.93). None of the patients had fever. Eighty-five
percent were supported on spontaneous ventilation, 22% received
prehospital non-invasive ventilation, they all showed signs of severity
and 3% need tracheal intubation. Seventy-five percent of patients
received 8,-agonist and anticholinergic nebulization, 45% intravenous
corticosteroids. Seventy-one percent were admitted to the emergency
room, 29% to the ICU.

Conclusion Most of the patients had signs of severity and
bronchospasm. The absence of fever and antibiotics allows us to think
that the cause of decompensation is not pneumonia. Although most of
them were hypoxic and hypercapnic, they seem to be good candidates
for NIV support in prehospital care. Very few studies report the use of
NIV in cases of COPD respiratory failure in the first care delivered at
home.

Introduction Plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-
BNP) levels are elevated in patients with pulmonary disease especially
in those with concomitant right ventricular dysfunction. The aim of the
present study was to investigate the use of plasma NT-pro-BNP levels as
a prognostic tool in patients with exacerbation of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD).

Methods A retrospective medical records analysis of all patients
hospitalized between June 2009 and June 2012 with the final diagnosis
of acute exacerbation of COPD who had undergone NT-pro-BNP
measurements at admission followed by echocardiogram.

Results Seventy-two patients (mean age 69 years, 58% male) with
COPD exacerbation but without clinical or echocardiography-oriented
evidence of acute cardiac disease were enrolled. The mean forced
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1)/forced vital capacity ratio was
44.2% and the mean FEV 1 was 0.82 |. Median NT-pro-BNP levels
at admission were 424.4 pg/ml and the tertile limits were 262.1 and
930 pg/ml. NT-pro-BNP levels significantly predicted 30-day mortality
(OR: 7.2, 95% Cl: 3.9 to 15.2; P <0.001), (OR: 25, 95% Cl: 16.3 to 37.3;
P <0.001) and (OR: 44, 95% Cl: 44.5 to 76.2) for each tertile. These
associations persisted after adjusting for arterial CO, pressure, body
mass index, age, gender and systolic pulmonary artery pressure.
Conclusion Among patients with acute exacerbation of chronic
pulmonary disease, NT-pro-BNP could be a useful marker for severity
and poor prognosis.

Introduction Retrospective studies suggest that cardiac troponin
levels are often elevated in patients with acute exacerbation of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) indicating a poor
survival. Novel high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTnT) assays have
better analytical precision than standard troponin (cTnT) assays. We
elaborated a prospective cohort study to investigate the prognostic
value of this novel biomarker in patients with AECOPD.

Methods Fifty-six patients (mean age 64 years, 68% male) with the
final diagnosis of AECOPD were enrolled. Those who were diagnosed
with acute coronary syndromes were excluded. We measured cardiac
troponin T with a standard fourth-generation assay and a high-
sensitivity assay. Clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic
data were collected at admission and the primary prognostic endpoint
was death during 30 days of follow-up.

Results Mean hs-cTnT levels at admission were 34 ng/I. During the
follow-up period seven patients (12%) died. Thirty-eight percent of
patients had hs-cTnT above the range of 14 ng/I. Prognostic accuracy
of hs-cTnT for death was significantly higher, with area under the
ROC curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% Cl: 0.72 to 0.86), than that of cTnT (AUC:
0.63, 95% Cl: 0.56 to 0.74; P <0.001). After adjustment for age, gender,
creatinine levels, heart rate, left ventricular ejection fraction, arterial
O, pressure and systolic pulmonary artery pressure, hs-cTnT above the

99th percentile was associated with a hazard ratio for death of 3.2 (95%
Cl: 1.5 to 6.7).

Conclusion In AECOPD, novel biomarkers such as hs-cTnT appear to be
positively associated with COPD severity and could be a determinant
of mortality.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P135 (doi: 10.1186/cc12073)

Introduction Laboratory testing for viral infections is not routinely
performed in adult patients admitted to the ICU. However, reports
indicate that viruses may contribute to significant morbidity and
mortality and that viral-bacterial co-infection is associated with poor
outcome in this particular patient population. The aim of the study was
to document the incidence of respiratory virus infections in critically ill
adult patients admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure.
Methods The prospective, observational study took place during
two consecutive winter seasons in a mixed 16-bed ICU at the Medical
Center Leeuwarden, the Netherlands. Adult patients admitted to
the ICU, suspected of respiratory failure due to community-acquired
pneumonia, were included. After informed consent brushed
nasopharyngeal swab (Copan®) samples were taken within 24 hours
after admission and analyzed by PCR assays for the presence of
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, metapneumovirus
(MPV), parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus.
Data are presented as median (IQR).

Results Thirty-four patients were enrolled. Median age was 66 (54 to
71) years; 65% of the patients were male; median APACHE IV score on
admission was 76 (61 to 96). Median ICU stay was 8 (5 to 17) days, with
an overall hospital mortality of 12%. Thirteen patients (38%) tested
positive for a respiratory virus. The most frequently found virus was
influenza (37%), followed by RSV (15%), rhinovirus (15%), MPV (15%),
corona virus (9%) and parainfluenza virus (9%). Two of the patients
(6%) had a bacterial-viral co-infection (blood culture and PCR positive
for Streptococcus pneumonia and rhinovirus in one patient and for
Haemophilus influenza and influenza virus in the second patient).
Length of stay in the ICU was significantly longer in PCR-negative
patients, in comparison with PCR-positive patients (11 (6 to 20) vs. 7 (2
to 8) days, respectively, P <0.05).

Conclusion Respiratory viruses, and particularly influenza virus, are
frequently found in adult patients with respiratory failure admitted to
the ICU.

Role of bronchoscopy during non-invasive ventilation in
hypercapnic respiratory failure

Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P136 (doi: 10.1186/cc12074)

Introduction Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is
the first-line treatment for hypercapnic acute respiratory failure (ARF)
secondary to COPD exacerbation in selected patients. Limited data
exist supporting the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) during this
clinical setting. The aim of this study is to assess the role of FOB during
NIPPV in patients with decompensated COPD acute exacerbation.

Methods This study is a randomized prospective case-control pilot
study carried out on 50 patients admitted to critical care units at
Alexandria University Hospital, Egypt suffering from hypercapnic ARF
secondary to COPD exacerbation with Kelly Matthay Score from 2 to 4.
All patients received NIPPV. Patients were divided randomly into two

$51

equal groups: group | (cases, 25 patients) were subjected to additional
intervention, early FOB during the first 6 to 12 hours from admission;
while group II (control, 25 patients) received the conventional treatment
and NIPPV only. Outcome parameters measured were changes in ABG
data, duration of NIPPV, rate of its success, ICU stay and mortality as
well as the safety of FOB and possible complications.

Results No significant difference was detected between the two
groups regarding the baseline characteristics. No serious complications
happened from FOB, oxygen desaturation occurred in 4/25 patients
(16%), tachycardia in 2/25 patients (8%). In group I, 23 patients (92%)
were successfully weaned from NIPPV versus 16 patients (64%) in
group II (P = 0.037). Total duration of NIPPV was 28.52 hours in group |
versus 56.25 hours in group II (P = 0.001). Length of ICU stay was 4.84
days in group | versus 8.68 days in group II (P = 0.001). Only one patient
died in group | versus three patients in group II (P = 0.609).

Conclusion The early application of FOB during NIPPV in patients
with ARF due to COPD exacerbation was shown to be safe. Significant
improvement in the outcome of patients who underwent FOB was
noticed in terms of improved ABG data, shorter duration of NIPPV,
higher percentage of success and shorter ICU stay while no significant
difference was detected in mortality.

SMART-COP score for patients admitted with community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP) to an ICU in a district general hospital: a smarter
way of identifying patients with severe CAP?

Introduction British Thoracic Society guidelines on community-
acquired pneumonia (CAP) advocate ICU referral for patients with
CURB65 score of 4 and 5. A recently developed scoring system, SMART-
COP, designed to identify patients at need of intensive respiratory or
vasopressor support (IRVS), has been validated in a variety of settings.
It predicts the need for ICU admission (defined as need for IRVS) with
greater accuracy than CURB65, but is not used routinely in our UK
institution.
Methods We retrospectively analysed critical care admissions of
patients with a diagnosis of CAP in a UK district general hospital —
ICNARC-coded diagnoses of pneumonia (bacterial, viral, no organisms
isolated) over a 7-month period (August 2011 to January 2012). We
ascertained the CURB65 and SMART-COP scores on referral to the ICU
and matched them in relation to the need for IRVS, length of inotropic
and ventilatory support and ICU length of stay.
Results Our search revealed 28 potential matches. Five patients were
excluded (not CAP) and the notes for seven patients were not available
for analysis. We analysed the notes of 16 patients matching our criteria.
In this small sample, there was a strong association between increasing
SMART-COP score and the need for IRVS (correlation coefficient r =
0.96). There was also a strong correlation with longer inotropic support
(r = 0.85) and longer ventilatory support (r = 0.96) with increasing
SMART-COP scores but a weaker correlation with length of ICU stay (r=
0.49). Moreover, none of the patients admitted to the ICU had CURB65
score higher than 3 at the time of ICU referral.
Conclusion In our small sample, higher SMART-COP score was
associated with increased likelihood of IRVS. This suggests that a further
study with a larger sample size should be performed to investigate
whether SMART-COP is an improvement on CURB65 in predicting the
need for IRVS in UK intensive care patients.

Introduction Streptococcal pneumonia remains the most common
cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), bacterial meningitis
and bacteremia. Severe pneumonia caused by streptococcal pneu-
monia frequently exists in the emergency room or ICU. We performed
this study to evaluate the effect of steroid therapy for severe strepto-
coccal pneumonia patients with mechanical ventilation retrospectively.
Methods We enrolled 13 adults of streptococcal pneumonia patients
who required mechanical ventilation. Seven of 13 patients (S group)
were administered with steroid (hydrocortisone 200 to 300 mg/day),
and the remaining six patients received no steroid therapy (NS group).
As the conventional therapies, mechanical ventilation was commenced
when a patient’s PaO,/FiO, showed less than 200 or they clinically
complained of being short of breath. All patients received appropriate
fluid therapies, vasoactive agents and blood transfusion according
to the protocol of early goal-directed therapy in the Surviving Sepsis
Campaign Guidelines 2008, and also were treated with antibiotics,
immunoglobulins (5 g/day for 3 days) and sivelestat sodium hydrate
(4.8 mg/kg/day for 7 days).

Results The APACHE scores in the S group and NS group were 27 + 10
and 23 + 4, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were 8 + 4
and 7 + 3, respectively. These scores showed no significant difference
between the groups. Procalcitonin (PCT) in the S and NS groups was
20.7 + 21.7 and 45.0 + 47.7 ng/ml, respectively, and there was no
significant difference between the groups. PCT declined significantly
in both groups. PaO,/FiO, of the NS group was significantly higher
than the S group on ICU admission and 4 days after admission, but
no significant difference on 7 days after ICU admission. IL-6 of the NS
group declined significantly after ICU admission, and the S group also
tended to decline.

Conclusion Steroid therapy for severe streptococcal pneumonia
patients with mechanical ventilation may have a potential to maintain
oxygenation of the lung, but no significant effects on changes of
inflammatory markers (IL-6, CRP).

Introduction Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most
common nosocomial infection in ICU patients who require mechanical
ventilation support. The aim of this study was to determine predictors
for the development of VAP in surgical ICU patients admitted to Baskent
University Hospital.

Methods Following Institutional Review Board approval we performed
this retrospective study, including 876 patients admitted to the surgical
ICU between January 2009 and July 2012. After completing a review of
patient data, 45 patients diagnosed with VAP were compared with 26
appropriate matches who were not. Patients’ demographical features
(age, sex, body weight), underlying diseases, etiology for |CU admission,
APACHE II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, duration of
hospitalization, organ dysfunctions, fluid balances, laboratory values,
use of vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, nutrition, antibiotics,
transfusions, features related to central venous catheterization, urinary
catheterization, and intubation were the recorded parameters. Patients

$52

who were not intubated and were discharged or died within 2 days of
ICU admission were excluded.
Results Out of 71 patients who were included in the final analysis, 45
patients (63%) had VAP. Comparing with the control group, patients
who developed VAP were more likely to have diabetes mellitus and
immunosuppression (P = 0.020 and P = 0.014, respectively). These
patients also had higher APACHE II scores (P = 0.020) and a longer
duration of mechanical ventilation (P <0.001), and more frequently had
an open wound (P = 0.001). Following regression analysis, presence
of diabetes mellitus (OR: 12.048; 95% Cl: 1.157 to 125.000; P = 0.037),
immunosuppression (OR: 16.949, 95% Cl: 2.463 to 111.111; P = 0.004),
and open wound (OR: 5.714; 95% Cl: 1.017 to 37.258; P = 0.048), higher
APACHE Il scores (OR: 1.132; 95% Cl: 1.022 to 1.254; P = 0.018), and
prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.084; 95% Cl: 1.002
to 1.171; P = 0.043) were determined as risk factors for VAP. Fourteen-
day and 28-day mortality rates for VAP were 19% and 29%, respectively
(P = 0.760 and P= 1.000, respectively).
Conclusion The presence of diabetes mellitus and immunosuppression,
higher APACHE II scores, longer mechanical ventilation duration, and
presence of open wounds were predictors of VAP.

Introduction Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive
and nonradiating imaging technique, which can be used to visualize
ventilation distribution of the lungs and could distinguish between the
dependent (dorsal) and nondependent (ventral) parts.

Methods The aim of this study was to observe ventilation distribution
between dependent and nondependent lung regions, for the individual
patient, during three different levels of support during pressure
support (PS) and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) ventilation.
Ten mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU were included.

Results The ratio for dependent/nondependent distribution of
ventilation is significantly higher at lower support levels compared
with higher support levels in both PS and NAVA. However, during NAVA
there was significantly less impedance loss between the different levels
of assist compared with PS. Tidal volumes decreased when decreasing
assist levels during PS whereas not during NAVA ventilation. The
electrical activity of the diaphragm decreased in both PS and NAVA with
higher levels of assist. Three patients showed an increase in dependent
tidal impedance variation (TIV) after lowering the assist level from 15 to
10 cmH,0. This increase in TIV did not occur during NAVA ventilation.
Conclusion There is more ventilation in the dependent part of the
lung, compared with the nondependent part, at lower levels of assist.
This could indicate that at higher support levels the contribution
of the diaphragm is reduced. During NAVA ventilation, there is an
autoregulation in which the patient is adjusting his tidal ventilation to
maintain homogeneous ventilation distribution.

outcomes for children with status asthmaticus and obesity in our PED.
Methods Patients placed on BiPAP in the PED for status asthmaticus
from 1 January 2010 to 31 August 2012 were included in the analysis.
Subjects were divided into moderate and severe exacerbations and
then further subdivided into the following growth curve-based weight
subgroups: <90 percentile, 90 to 97 percentile and >97 percentile.
Subjects received standard asthma therapies in addition to BiPAP. Data
were obtained at the bedside by the respiratory therapist or collected
retrospectively by study investigators. Data were stored and analyzed
using a RedCap database.

Results Three hundred and fifty-nine subjects were analyzed. Table 1
shows the time on BiPAP per visit. Children whose weight was >97
percentile revealed trends towards longer treatment times on BiPAP
compared with the other two groups. The moderate subjects who
weighed >97 percentile had statistically significant longer treatment
periods (P <0.006) when compared with the <90 percentile moderate
group. Initial BiPAP settings are listed in Table 2. When controlling for
age, higher BiPAP settings correlated with increasing weight. There
were no weight-based trends for admissions to the PICU or overall
hospital lengths of stay. No serious complications were noted.
Conclusion This is the first study to analyze the weight effect on BiPAP
application in children with status asthmaticus. Subjects who weighed
more trended greater mean time on BiPAP and initial BiPAP settings.
Weight did affect PICU admissions or overall length of hospital stay.

Determinants of non-invasive ventilation success or failure in
morbidly obese patients in acute respiratory failure

Schaffner Hospital, Lens, France

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P142 (doi: 10.1186/cc12080)

Introduction Malignant obesity hypoventilation syndrome (MOHS)
refers to the association between morbid obesity (body mass index
>40 kg/m’), daytime hypercapnia (PCO, >45 mmHg) after other
respiratory or neuromuscular causes of alveolar hypoventilation have
been excluded, and multiple organ disorders (diabetes mellitus, arterial
hypertension, metabolic syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome)
[1]. Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a common life-threatening
complication of MHOS. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) provides the
cornerstone of the therapeutic management of decompensated MOHS
[2]. We aimed to identify the determinants of NIV success or failure in
this indication.

Methods A monocentric prospective observational study including 48
patients with MOHS and treated by NIV for ARF over a 2-year period.
Results NIV failed to reverse ARF in only seven patients. NIV failure
was associated with a sixfold increase in in-hospital mortality (85.7%
vs. 14.6%; P <0.001). Factors associated with NIV failure and need for
endotracheal intubation included pneumonia (n = 5, 71.4% vs. n = 8,
19.5%; P = 0.01), higher SOFA (11 vs. 5; P <0.001) and SAPS 2 (69 vs.
39; P = 0.001) score at admission. The only factor associated with
successful response to NIV was idiopathic decompensated MOHS
(n= 19, 100% vs. n =0, 0%; P = 0.03). In these patients, pH (7.23 vs. 7.28
vs. 7.44, respectively, at HO, H2, H24; P <0.05) and PCO, (74.5 vs. 68.5 vs.
57 mmHg, respectively, at HO, H2, H24; P <0.05) dramatically improved
with NIV.

Conclusion NIV provides a very efficient therapy to reverse hypercapnic
ARF in morbidly obese patients. Multiple organ failure and pneumonia
are the main factors associated with NIV failure in patients with MOHS.

Introduction The benefits of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in patients
with type 2 respiratory failure secondary to exacerbations of COPD
are widely acknowledged [1], but its efficacy in respiratory failure of
other aetiologies is less clear. We describe use of NIV (bilevel and/
or continuous positive airway pressure modes) in the subgroup of
patients with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia in a 35-bed adult
critical care unit (ACCU).

Methods A retrospective review of data recorded prospectively on
an electronic clinical information management system at University
College Hospital (UCH), London, UK. Patients requiring NIV acutely
at UCH are managed on the ACCU. Electronic records reviewed for
patients admitted from 1 November 2010 to 2 December 2011 with
clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, and in whom NIV was recorded on >6
occasions on the electronic chart. We concede some patients on NIV
<6 hours may have been missed. We excluded patients in whom NIV was
the ceiling of therapy and those using domiciliary NIV. The following
data were collected: baseline patient demographics, comorbidities,
therapy received in the ACCU, respiratory physiological variables,
length of stay/unit outcome. Descriptive statistics of the cohort and
variables associated on univariate analysis with requirement for
intubation were generated using MedCalc Version 12.3.0.0 (MedCalc
Software, Mariakerke, Belgium).

Results Fifty-two patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 29 (55.8%)
were male, median age was 62.4 (IQR 48.8 to 71.6), median unit stay
was 8 days (IQR 4.5 to 16.5), mean duration of NIV use was 2 days (IQR 1
to 3), 27 (51.9%) required intubation of whom 48% died. Total mortality
was 13 (25%) — all intubated. Patients with recorded comorbidities were
more likely to be intubated than those without (OR = 4.3, P = 0.0362);
PH was significantly lower in those requiring intubation at all recorded
time points; and mean FiO, at 4 to 6 hours was significantly higher in
those requiring intubation(0.72 vs. 0.56, P = 0.032). There was a trend

----$$$$----$$$$----
Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2
http://ccforum.com/supplements/17/S2

toward patients with COPD requiring intubation more often (OR = 8.4,

P=0.0711).

Conclusion NIV was successful in 48.1% of patients with pneumonia,

the remainder requiring intubation. Given the high mortality in those

patients who failed NIV we believe its use in a ward setting is hazardous.

We conclude that NIV may be useful in some individuals with

pneumonia, but they should be managed in the ACCU setting. Further

work is required to identify those patients at risk of deterioration on NIV

given the possible excess mortality.

Introduction Benefits of the use of NIV in emergency departments are
well established. Training and available staff, and choice of respiratory
machines are essential criteria for success.
Methods We conducted an observational, descriptive, retrospective,
single-center study in a 4-month period. COPD patients with respiratory
failure who received prehospital NIV were included. We compared two
groups: COPD patients with NIV, and COPD patients without NIV.
Results Forty-two patients were included, mean age 68.86 years
(+ 11.98), 57.14% smokers, 64.28% arterial hypertension, 100% long-
term oxygenotherapy, 23.80% antibiotics in the 7 days before, 28.57%
corticosteroids. A total of 88.09% had bronchospasm, 78.26% had
struggle signs, 28.57% were unable to speak, 14.28% of patients were
sweating. The mean respiratory rate was 30.5 cycles/minute (+ 7.17),
mean pulse rate was 105.76 (+ 25.34). Nasal EtCO, was 47.75 mmHg
(+ 16.53), pulse oxymetry in air was 85% (+ 10.94), oxygen flow
rate was 5.45 I/minute (+ 2.42), temperature was 37.14°C (+ 8.15).
Twenty patients received NIV. A total of 61.90% were admitted to
the emergency department, 35.71% to the ICU, and one patient
was left at home. One patient received tracheal intubation in the
hosting service. Mortality in the first month was 13.04%. A significant
difference (P <0.05) was found for: sweats (30%/0), respiratory rate
(34 + 8.23/27 + 6.11), nasal EtCO, (55.0 + 24.4/40.50 + 9.03), pulse
oxymetry in air (80% + 8.63/90% + 13.25), pulse oxymetry with
oxygen (89.4% + 4.24/87.90% + 2.55), B,-mimetic and anti-cholinergic
nebulization (60% + 0.5/90% + 0.29), emergency room admission
(35% + 0.35/86% + 0.48), ICU admission (60% + 0.5/13% + 0.35),
arterial blood gases on arrival in the host service (PaCO,
76.6 + 18.66/43.93 + 11.78). No difference in mortality at 1 month (2/3).
Conclusion Non-invasive ventilation has improved the management
and prognosis of COPD patients admitted to the emergency room.
Very few studies concern the prehospital management. NIV seems to
show an effect on prehospital care, especially in patients with signs of
severity, hypercapnia, and without fever. Oxygenation and hypercapnia
seem to be improved. Also fewer patients are admitted to the ICU.
Bronchospasm does not seem to be an obstacle.

Introduction Inadequate respiratory muscle activity has been linked

monitoring respiratory muscle activity during mechanical ventilation

$54

are specialized and relatively invasive. Visualizing diaphragm thickening
during inspiration by ultrasound may permit non-invasive monitoring.
We explored the feasibility, reliability and physiological significance of
diaphragm thickening on ultrasound.

Methods Five healthy subjects participated. We monitored inspiratory
flow, volume, esophageal and gastric pressures, and diaphragm
electrical activity (by esophageal and surface electromyography) while
subjects performed a series of inspiratory maneuvers: tidal breathing,
threshold-loaded breathing, a Muller maneuver, and inspiration to
various lung volumes above functional residual capacity. At the end
of each inspiratory effort, subjects were instructed to close the glottis
and relax the respiratory muscles (so as to maintain lung volume while
eliminating diaphragm activation). Sonographic images of diaphragm
thickening during these maneuvers were obtained using M-mode with
a 13 MHz linear array probe placed in the right ninth, 10th, or 11th
intercostal space between the middle and anterior axillary lines.
Results Diaphragm thickening in the zone of apposition was readily
visualized by ultrasound in all five subjects. Mean end-expiratory
diaphragm thickness was 2.1 mm (SD = 0.3 mm). During tidal
breathing, the diaphragm thickened by a mean of 35% (SD = 31%). The
Bland-Altman coefficient of reproducibility was 0.5 mm; approximately
50% of measurement variability arose from caliper positioning on the
ultrasound machine; diaphragm thickness measurements changed as
the probe was placed in different intercostal interspaces. Diaphragm
inspiratory thickening increased significantly with increasing
inspiratory effort but also varied with lung volume independent of
effort. At inspiratory volumes below 40% of inspiratory capacity, lung
volume change contributed minimally to diaphragm thickening.
Conclusion Visualizing diaphragm thickening in the zone of appo-
sition by ultrasound provides a feasible non-invasive technique for
monitoring diaphragm activation in healthy subjects. Diaphragm
thickening primarily reflects muscular effort rather than altered muscle
conformation induced by changes in lung volume, especially at lower
inspiratory volumes.

Methods Institutional ethics approval was obtained. The Medtrack
clinical information system was searched to identify patients who
received MV for >48 hours and who had significant chronic pulmonary
disease or left/right ventricular impairment between April 2009 and
March 2012. Age, APACHE II score, ventilated days, time in NAVA and
outcome were compared between groups who had or had not received
EAdi monitoring.

Results In total, 493/2,684 (18.3%) patients had heart-lung risk factors
for prolonged weaning. One hundred and four patients received EAdi
monitoring. Ventilated days were significantly reduced (Figure 1) in
the EAdi monitored group (median 9) versus the nonmonitored group
(median 12); P = 0.024 (Mann-Whitney U test). ICU mortality was not
significantly different and there was no correlation between time spent
in NAVA and days ventilated.

Conclusion EAdi catheter insertion was associated with a significant
reduction in time spent on MV. A prospective RCT will be needed to
confirm benefit and explore mechanisms.

Introduction Patients with acute respiratory failure demand dynamic
evaluation and interventions. Lung ultrasound is a bedside technique,
very promising in this setting. Previously, Lichtenstein and colleagues
proposed an algorithm approach with a diagnostic accuracy of 90.5%,
named Bedside Lung Ultrasound in Emergency (BLUE protocol).
However, this approach has never been validated in other populations
or ultrasound operators. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
diagnostic accuracy of the lung ultrasound algorithm (BLUE protocol)
in ICU patients admitted with acute respiratory failure.
Methods A prospective study, single-center consecutive case series
evaluating critically ill adult patients in acute respiratory failure,
admitted to a 23-bed general ICU between October 2011 and
November 2012. The ultrasound examination was performed by an ICU
physician until 20 minutes after admission, without interfering with
usual care, and the ultrasound operator was blinded to the medical
history of the patient. Three items were assessed: artifacts (horizontal
A lines or vertical B lines indicating interstitial syndrome), lung sliding,
alveolar consolidation and/or pleural effusion. BLUE protocol results
were compared with clinical diagnosis by the medical assistant team
at the end of the ICU stay.
Results Forty-two patients were evaluated (42% male), mean age was
73 years (SD + 15) and APACHE II score was 18.77 (median 20). Based
upon evaluation of the findings of BLUE protocol, a positive correlation
was found in 83.78% of the sample. For the diagnosis of pulmonary
edema (n = 15), sensitivity was 85% and specificity was 86%, while for
the diagnosis of pneumonia (n = 17), sensitivity was 88% and specificity
was 90%. In this sample there were only four cases of reversible airway
obstruction and one case of pulmonary embolism. Five patients were
excluded of the analysis because they had rare diagnoses.
Conclusion Preliminary results demonstrate diagnostic accuracy of
lung ultrasound examination performed on the admission of patients
with acute respiratory failure similar to the original publication. Lung
ultrasound, as proposed in the BLUE protocol, has good accuracy, and
seems reproducible and useful in this group of patients.

Risk of weaning failure with PAOP =15 versus PAOP =18
Y Nassar, A Abdelbary

Cairo University, Giza, Egypt

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P148 (doi: 10.1186/cc12086)

Introduction Despite 18 mmHg being recognized as a classical cutoff
value, there is no definite value of PAOP above which cardiogenic
oedema develops. We aimed to assess the risks of weaning failure with
PAOP =15 and with PAOP =18.

Methods A prospective enrollment of 30 adult medical ICU patients
on invasive mechanical ventilation who were fulfilling the criteria for
initiation of weaning from mechanical ventilation according to the
Sixth International Conference Statement of Intensive Care Medicine.
We followed the two-step weaning strategy, which involves assessment
regarding readiness for weaning followed by a spontaneous breathing
trial (SBT) as a diagnostic test to determine the likelihood of successful
extubation. Invasive right heart catheterization to measure PAOP, and
non-invasive transthoraxic echo and tissue Doppler parameters E/E;
E/A, DT, IVRT were measured before initiation and after termination of
the SBT.

Results E/E’ was significantly correlated with PAOP (r= 503, P<0.001).A
cutoff value of septal E/E’>11.3 predicted PAOP elevation >18 mmHg
with a sensitivity of 90.9% and specificity of 87.8%, while a value of
septal E/E’>10.9 predicted PAOP elevation >15 mmHg with a sensitivity
of 59.1% and specificity of 87.8%. The incidence of weaning failure
was 23%, and 72% of patients who failed to be weaned exhibited
significantly higher PAOP during the trial. Patients with PAOP =18 at
the end of the SBT mostly (72.4%) failed weaning while a minority
(27.6%) successfully weaned. The majority (91.3%) of the patients
with PAOP <18 had a successful weaning outcome and 8.7% failed
weaning outcome. PAOP =18 significantly negatively correlated with
weaning success (P = 0.001, r = -0.627). On the other hand, PAOP =15
did not show a significant correlation (P >0.05, r = -0.274). The PAOP
>18 weaning failure risk estimate was 8.2, with 95% Cl 0.004 to 0.3. The
PAOP =15 weaning failure risk estimate was 1.83, with a significant 95%
Cl of 0.913 to 3.648.

Conclusion E/E’ was significantly correlated with PAOP (r = 503,
P <0.001). E/E’ > 11.3 predicted PAOP elevation =>18 mmHg (sensitivity
90.9% and specificity 87.8%), while E/E’ >10.9 predicted PAOP elevation
>15 mmHg (sensitivity 59.1% and specificity 87.8%). Weaning failure
risk is greater (8.2 vs. 1.8) with PAOP =18 versus PAOP =15, respectively.

Impact of continuous positive airway pressure on the treatment of
acute exacerbation of asthma: a randomised controlled trial

Ramathibothi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P149 (doi: 10.1186/cc12087)

Introduction Despite the extensive use of continuous positive airway
pressure (CPAP) in various respiratory failure conditions, its role in acute
asthmatic attack is uncertain [1-3]. This study aims at exploring the
efficacy of CPAP when use in addition to the conventional treatment of
acute asthma exacerbation in the emergency department (ED).
Methods During May to December 2009, acute asthma patients
attending ED were randomly assigned to CPAP and control groups. In
addition to the conventional treatment, CPAP ventilation of 8 cmH,O
was applied to patients in the CPAP group. Data collections in both
groups included peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR, %predicted) at
each 15-minute interval (TO, T15, ...), the number of short-acting
bronchodilators (SABA) used, ED length of stay, relapse rate and
admission rate. The primary outcome is the improvement in peak
expiratory flow rate during a short period stay in the ED.

Results There were 86 patients enrolled, with 43 patients in each
study group. PEFR in the CPAP group showed no difference from the
control group at TO (52.7 + 20.33 vs. 47.2 + 16.64, P = NS) but was
significantly better at T15 (65.58 + 21.64 vs. 56.49 + 18.53%, P <0.05).
Such improvement was consistently observed for all subsequent PEFR
measurement, along with the fewer SABA used and relapse rate, but
the figures did not meet statistical difference.

Conclusion The addition of CPAP to conventional acute asthma

treatment in the ED could accelerate PEFR improvement with a trend

showing fewer SABA needed, lower relapse rate and shorter ED length

of stay.

Introduction Emergency endotracheal intubation results in accidental
oesophageal intubation in up to 17% of patients often with disastrous
consequences. We have previously published a highly specific and
sensitive novel method to detect endotracheal intubation based on
differences in ventilation pressure waveforms in the oesophagus and
in the trachea in patients with healthy lungs [1]. A detection algorithm,
based on differences in compliance/elasticity between the lung and
the oesophagus, generated a D-value indicating tracheal intubation if
D >0.5 and oesophageal intubation if D <0.5. The aim of the current
study was to validate the algorithm in patients with lung disease.
Methods After obtaining institutional approval, 20 intubated and
ventilated ICU patients were included. Inclusion criteria were controlled
mechanical ventilation and at least mild to moderate lung injury
according to a Murray lung injury score >0.1. A connecting piece was
placed between the endotracheal tube and the ventilation bag. This
piece comprised a thin air-filled catheter inserted through the tube
lumen at 1 cm from the distal end, and a second catheter located at
the proximal end of the tube. We performed three consecutive manual
bag ventilations while recording the pressure curves through both
catheters. For each ventilation, a D-value was calculated.

Results Mean age (SD) of the patients was 60 (16) years, 60% were
male. The mean (SD) Murray score was 1.4 (0.6). Pathologies included
pulmonary oedema, pneumonia, atelectasis and traumatic lung
injury. All 60 D-values are represented in Figure 1. The median
(IQR, range) D-value was 38 (16 to 74, 0.8 to 1,272). Our algorithm
therefore confirmed a high sensitivity to detect correct endotracheal
intubation also in patients with lung disease. Under the hypothesis that
oesophageal compliance does not increase significantly in patients
with lung disease, the specificity of our algorithm will not be affected.
Conclusion The algorithm to detect correct endotracheal intubation
performed excellent in patients with lung disease.

Main indications, diagnostic and therapeutic yield of bronchoscopy
in the ICU

J Iglesias, B Gonzalez, O Rajas

La Princesa Hospital, Madrid, Spain

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P151 (doi: 10.1186/cc12089)

Introduction Bronchoscopy (BC) is a frequently used diagnostic and
therapeutic tool in our ICU. We planned to review the patients and
conditions in which the procedure was performed. The objective was
to determine indications, diagnostic and therapeutic yield.

Methods A retrospective, single-center observational study was carried
out. All BC performed in a 20-bed polyvalent ICU of a tertiary university
hospital over a period of 30 months (from January 2010 to June 2012)
were included. The main variables collected were demographic data
and clinical data including comorbidities, endobronchial techniques
and results.

Results A total of 470 BC were carried out in 240 patients admitted to
the ICU (68% were male and 32% were female). All of the procedures
were performed in mechanically ventilated patients. The mean patient
age was 61 + 14 years, with an APACHE II score at admission of 20 + 7. The
main cause for ICU admission was respiratory failure (27%). The most
common comorbidities were smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, cardiovascular risk factors and atrial fibrillation. The main
indications for performing the BC were percutaneous tracheostomy
endoscopically guided (28%), resolution of atelectasis (27%), aspiration
of secretions (24%) and hemoptysis (10%). Bronchial brushing was
performed in 435 cases (93%) obtaining microbiological growth in 64%
of them, mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii.
Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 62 cases (13%) obtaining
microbiological growth in 61% of them, mainly cytomegalovirus and
Stenotrophomona maltophilia. Citology was performed in 60 cases
(13%); 7% showed the presence of microorganism and 13% revealed
precancerous/cancerous tissue changes.

Conclusion BC can be performed at the bedside, avoiding transfers
outside the ICU that may cause clinical worsening. Most frequent
indications were bronchoscopy-guided percutaneous tracheostomy,
resolution of atelectasis, aspiration of secretions and hemoptysis.
Microbiological results obtained revealed the presence of aggressive
pathogens. BC in ICU provides valuable diagnostic information and has
therapeutic utility.

with conventional Portex (PT, globular PVC cuff) in leakages across
cuffs (microaspiration) under simulated clinical situations. It has been
shown that globular PVC cuffs protect poorly against leakages due
to microchannels formed from infolding of redundant cuff material
[1]. We hypothesized that TG and MC better prevent microaspiration,
which is a major mechanism of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
Methods Each ETT was inserted into a silicone cylinder of 2 cm
wide inclined at 35°. Then 20 ml water was added above the cuff
and leakage measured every minute under five different simulated
clinical conditions: mechanical ventilation for acute severe asthma
(positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 0 cmH,O), normal lungs (PEEP
5 cmH,O) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (PEEP 10 cmH,O),
and disconnection from the ventilator with and without spontaneous
breathing effort. Spontaneous breathing was simulated with a
respiratory gas exchange simulator. Suction was applied at 200 cmH,O
sustained for 3 minutes at the Murphy eye. Each scenario was repeated
with cuff pressures (Pcuff) 10, 20 and 30 cmH,O maintained by a Pcuff
maintenance device.

Results PT leaked grossly in all scenarios without PEEP and at PEEP
5 cmH,O in the presence of suction irrespective of Pcuff (Pcuff
30 cmH,O: PT 19.7 + 0.4, TG 0.0 + 0.1, MC 0.0 + 0.0, P <0.001; Pcuff
20 cmH,O: PT 19.9 + 0.4, TG 7.4 + 6.2, MC 0.0 + 0.0, P <0.001; Pcuff
10 cmH,O: PT 20.0 + 0.0, TG 12.7 + 5.1, MC 0.9 + 0.8, P <0.001). Leakage
under these scenarios can be reduced in TG and prevented in MC by
Pcuff >20 cmH.0O (Figure 1).

Conclusion Microcuff outperformed the others in preventing
microaspiration, while Portex leaked grossly even at a recommended
Pcuff of 20 to 30 cmH,O whenever PEEP was lost. The effect of ETT type
on the incidence of VAP warrants further investigation.

Introduction The most common cause of ventilator-associated
pneumonia (VAP) is aspiration of oral secretion through the
endotracheal tube (ET). Subglottic suction drainage (SSD) has been
recommended as a safety measure against aspiration due to its
high effectiveness. Currently, two types of cuff shape - spindle and
tapered - are predominant in high-volume, low-pressure (HVLP) ETs

S57

with SSD. However, the shape most suitable for preventing dripping
onto the subglottis has not been determined. The purpose of this study
was to determine whether an ET with tapered-type cuff can reduce the
incidence of VAP.

Methods After approval from the appropriate ethics committee, we
conducted a single-institutional prospective randomized clinical trial
on the effectiveness of using an ET with a different cuff type. Adult
patients (n = 399; =>18 years old) were screened between April 2010
and March 2012, and 289 patients expected to require mechanical
ventilation (MV) for at least 48 hours were randomized. Patients were
assigned to intubation with one of the following two HVLP ETs with
SSD on the experimental tube: tapered type (Taperguard™ Evac®;
Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) or spindle type (Hi-Lo Evac®; Covidien). Cuff
pressure measurement was carried out every 6 hours, and cuff pressure
was maintained between 20 and 30 cmH,O. The primary outcome was
VAP incidence based on semiquantitative bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
culture of 3+ or phagocytosis on Gram staining in patients intubated
for at least 48 hours. The other outcome was the rate of achieving an
appropriate cuff pressure (20 to 30 cmH,0O), time to VAP onset, duration
of MV, duration of ICU stay, mortality, and adverse events.

Results The rate of microbiologically confirmed VAP was 21.7%
(23/106) for the tapered-type ET patients and 21.7% (23/106) for the
spindle-type ET patients (P = 1.00). The rate of achieving appropriate
cuff pressure was 83.2% (332/1,974) for the tapered type and 82.4%
(328/1,867) for the spindle type (P = 0.549). No significant differences
between groups were observed for time to VAP onset, duration of MV,
ICU stay. The incidence of reintubation due to laryngeal edema after
extubation was slightly higher in patients with the tapered-type ET
(11.5%, 6/52) than in patients with the spindle-type ET (2.0%, 1/49), but
the difference was not significant (P = 0.113).

Conclusion Differences in cuff type and shape under identical
conditions of cuff pressure control have no influence on the incidence
of VAP.

Introduction In order to avoid either microaspiration (<20 cmH,O) or
tracheal injury (>30 cmH,0), the target for endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff
pressure (CP) is between 20 and 30 cmH.O. Our objective was to assess
the effect of patient positioning changes on CP in adult patients.
Methods A sample of 12 orally intubated and sedated patients was
selected. Patients received neuromuscular blockade and were positioned
in a neutral start position (backrest, head of bed elevation (HoB)
30°, head in neutral position) and CP set at 25 cmH,O. Subsequently
16 different position changes were performed: anteflexion head,
hyperextension head, left and right lateral flexion of head, left and right
rotation of the head, semirecumbent position (HOB 45°), recumbent
position (HoB 10°), horizontal position, trendelenburg (-10°), left
and right lateral positioning over 30°, 45° and 90°. Once the patient
was correctly positioned, CP was recorded during an end-expiratory
ventilatory hold. CP observed was compared with CP at start position
(25 cmH,0). Also the number of values outside the target range (20 to
30 cmH,0) was reported as considered clinically relevant.

Results A total of 192 measurements were performed (12 subjectsx16
positions). Results are shown in Table 1 (CP reported as median, IQR).
In every position a significant deviation in CP was observed. In total,
40.6% of values exceeded the upper limit of 30 cmH,O. No values
beneath the lower target limit of 20 cmH,O were observed. In each
position the upper target limit was exceeded at least once.

Conclusion Simple changes in patient positioning may result in
potentially harmful CP (>30 cmH,O). These observations call for strict
CP monitoring.

Towards safer airway management in the critically ill: lessons from
National Audit Project 4

Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P155 (doi: 10.1186/cc12093)

Introduction National Audit Project 4 (NAP4) highlighted the need to
improve airway management in ICUs and key recommendations were
the continuous use of end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO,) monitoring,
pre-intubation checklists and difficult airway trolleys [1]. This complete
cycle audit aimed to quantify the current state of airway management
on our ICU and the effectiveness of implementing the NAP4
recommendations.

Methods Data collection was carried out prospectively for both
phases and included documentation of intubation, use of ETCO, and
the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs). The contents of the
intubation boxes were compared against the Difficult Airway Society
(DAS) guidelines [2]. The re-audit was carried out 6 months following
the introduction of a pre-intubation checklist, a documentation sticker,
a difficult airway trolley and standardization of the basic bedside
airway boxes with a checklist of contents. A training program in airway
management for all ICU staff was also introduced.

Results The baseline characteristics of both groups were similar. The
initial audit included 45 patients and the re-audit 58 patients. In the initial
audit 19% of patients had accurate documentation of intubation with
the use of ETCO,. The continuous use of ETCO, was 80%. Bedside airway
boxes did not contain a checklist of standardized equipment. A difficult
airway trolley was not located on the ICU. Following introduction of the
changes described, a significant improvement in the use of ETCO, to
confirm intubation (46% vs. 19%, P <0.01) and continuous use of ETCO,
monitoring (100% vs. 80% P <0.0004) was observed. The use of the pre-
intubation checklist (7%) and stickers (11%) was poor. All bedside boxes
had a checklist and the required equipment. A difficult airway trolley is
located on the ICU with an equipment list and DAS algorithm attached.
No SAEs were recorded in either phase.

Conclusion Serious airway complications are rare. Safer airway
management is essential in the ICU to prevent morbidity and mortality.

$58

This audit demonstrated that simple measures in conjunction with

a structured training program can help to improve the safety of

airway management in critically ill patients. Further work is required

to improve compliance with the pre-intubation checklist alongside a

continued education program.

Introduction The goal of this study was to assess the amount of
biofilm within the endotracheal tube (ETT) by CT scan and to evaluate
in a bench test a device aimed at ETT biofilm removal. Biofilm grows
within the ETT soon after intubation, resulting in increased resistance
to airflow. Biofilm detachment from the ETT can result in bacterial
colonization of the distal airways. The use of an ETT cleaning device
could effectively reduce the patient’s airflow resistance burden. The
quantification and distribution of biofilm within the ETT might help to
evaluate ETT cleaning device effectiveness.

Methods We collected ETTs of 11 critically ill patients after extubation.
Micro-CT scan (SkyScan 1176; Bruker, Belgium) was performed using
a resolution of 35 um. Axial sections of the 20 cm above the cuff were
reconstructed, and the volume of secretions was assessed by a density
criterion. Microbiological cultures of the ETT lavage fluid were then
obtained. Patient’s demographics and clinical data were recorded. In
a different set of bench experiments, we injected 1 ml water-based
polymer into new ETTs of different sizes. We measured resistance to
airflow before and after using an ETT cleaning device (Airway Medix
Closed Suction System; Biovo Technologies, Tel Aviv, Israel). We also
obtained resistance values of intact ETTs as controls.

Results The studied ETTs remained in place for a median of 7 days
(IQR range 4 to 15). The amount of secretions assessed by CT scan was
0.293 + 0.290 ml (range 0.032 to 0.777 ml). Secretion volumes were
not related to patient severity at admission (SAPS 2, P/F ratio) or days
of intubation; an inverse correlation with patient's age was present
(P = 0.032, R* = 0.46). Bacterial growth was present in 9/11 (82%)
ETT fluids cultures and Candida spp. showed an elevated prevalence
(6/11, 55%). In the bench tests, the cleaning device reduced resistance
to airflow (difference before and after cleaning 5.5 (95% Cl = 8.9 to
1.6) cmH,O/I/second, P = 0.006). After cleaning, resistance resulted
higher than intact ETTs, although with a clinically negligible difference
(difference 0.3 (95% Cl = 0.2 to 0.6 cmH,O/I/second), P = 0.032).
Conclusion Micro-CT scan is a feasible and promising technique to
assess secretions volume in ETTs after extubation. The use of an ETT
cleaning device decreases resistance to airflow in bench tests; the
effectiveness of such a device in the clinical setting could be properly
assessed by post-extubation CT scan.

issue, associated with severe life-threatening complications [1,2]. The
objective was to develop and validate a simplified score for identifying
patients with Dl in the ICU and to report related complications.

Methods Data collected in a prospective multicenter-study from 1,000
consecutive intubations from 42 ICUs were used to develop a simplified
score of DI, which was then validated externally in 400 consecutive
intubation procedures from 18 other ICUs and internally by bootstrap
on 1,000 iterations.

Results In multivariate analysis, the main predictors of DI (incidence =
11.3%) were related to the patient (Mallampati score Ill or IV,
obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, reduced mobility of cervical spine,
limited mouth opening), to pathology (severe hypoxia, coma) and to
the operator (non-anesthesiologist). From the B-parameter, a seven-
item simplified score (MACOCHA score; Table 1) was built, with an area
under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 (95% Cl = 0.85 to 0.94). In the validation
cohort (prevalence of DI = 8%), the AUC was of 0.86 (95% Cl = 0.76
to 0.96), with a sensitivity of 73%, a specificity of 89%, a negative
predictive value of 98% and a positive predictive value of 36%. After
internal validation by bootstrap, the AUC was 0.89 (95% Cl = 0.86 to
0.93). Severe life-threatening events (severe hypoxia, collapse, cardiac
arrest or death) occurred in 38% of the 1,000 cases. Patients with DI
(n = 113) had significantly higher severe life-threatening complications
than those who had a non-DI (51% vs. 36%, P <0.0001).

Introduction Our objective is to determine the incidence of major
complications related to endotracheal intubations (death, cardiac
arrest, severe hemodynamic instability or severe hypoxemia) per-
formed in the ICUs of nonacademic Brazilian public hospitals.
Methods This is a report of the baseline phase of a cluster randomized
trial with two parallel arms. In this baseline phase, we collected data
from sequential patients needing endotracheal intubation in 17 ICUs
from Brazil. Patients needing endotracheal intubation after cardiac
arrest were excluded. In a second ongoing phase, not reported
here, we have randomized ICUs to a multifaceted intervention to
prevent complications of endotracheal intubation. Primary outcome
was defined as the occurrence of death, cardiac arrest, severe
cardiovascular instability (systolic blood pressure <60 mmHg at least
one time, <90 mmHg and persisting >30 minutes or need to initiate
vasopressors) or severe hypoxemia (SpO, <80%) within 1 hour after
intubation.

Results We evaluated 246 intubations. The mean age was
49 + 21.9 years; the SAPS 3 admission score was 57.4 + 15.4. The most

S59

common indications of intubation were acute respiratory failure
(61.0%) and coma (17.1%). The primary outcome occurred in 138 of
246 intubations (56.1%). Within the first hour, the incidence of severe
hypotension was 47.2%, of severe hypoxemia was 20.3%, of cardiac
arrest was 5.7% and of death was 4.5%.

Conclusion Incidence of major complications associated with
endotracheal intubation is unacceptably high in Brazilian public ICUs.
There is an urgent need for effective measures to increase safety of this
common procedure in our environment.

Introduction The Airway scope® (AWS), the KingVision® (KV) and the
McGRATH® (MG) are new indirect video laryngoscopes designed
to facilitate effective and safe tracheal intubation under various
conditions. However, there are few comparative studies as for
performance in tracheal intubation attempted by inexperienced
personnel. The purpose of this study was to evaluate success rates, time
to intubation with use of these devices by inexperienced personnel ina
simulated manikin difficult airway.

Methods Twenty-nine fifth-year medical students with no previous
experience in tracheal intubation participated in this study. We used
an advanced patient simulator (SimMan®; Laerdal Medical, Stavanger,
Norway) to simulate normal and difficult airway scenarios including
cervical spine rigidity, swollen tongue, and pharyngeal edema. The
sequences in selecting devices and scenarios were randomized. Success
rate for tracheal intubation, and the time required for visualization
of the glottis (T1), tracheal intubation (T2), and inflation of the lungs
(T3) were analyzed. Also, numbers of audible dental click during the
intubation attempt were recorded. The three different intubation
devices were tested in four different scenarios by 29 students.

Results All three devices had very high success rates of tracheal
intubation (AWS 100%; KV 100%; MG 99%). In the normal airway, T1,
T2 and T3 were AWS: 4.4 + 3.3 seconds, 7.5 + 3.8 seconds, 11.1 + 3.8
seconds; KV: 6.9 + 6.9 seconds, 10.3 + 7.9 seconds, 14.1 + 8.3 seconds;
MG: 4.6 + 1.3 seconds, 11.4 + 5.2 seconds, 16.1 + 5.4 seconds,
respectively (NS). In the three difficult airway scenarios, T1, T2 and T3
were AWS: 5.3 + 4.7* seconds, 10.4 + 6.9* seconds, 14.2 + 6.9* seconds;
KV: 10.9 + 12.8 seconds, 21.5 + 18.1 seconds, 25.4 + 18.3 seconds;
MG: 13.0 + 15.3 seconds, 26.2 + 24.6 seconds, 31.0 + 24.3 seconds,
respectively (*P <0.05 AWS vs. KV and MG). The number of audible
dental click sounds with the MG was greater than with the AWS and KV
(AWS 5%*; KV 8%*; MG 28%*; *P <0.05 AWS and KV vs. MG).
Conclusion The AWS, KV and MG had very high success rates of tracheal
intubation and are suitable as intubation devices for inexperienced
personnel. In the difficult airway, however, the intubation time with
AWS was significantly shorter than with KV and MG. These findings
suggested that AWS may be most useful device particularly in difficult
situations such as emergency settings. Further studies in a clinical
setting are needed to confirm these findings.

Introduction In mechanically ventilated neonates the flow-dependent
resistance of the endotracheal tube (ETT) causes a noticeable pressure
difference between airway and tracheal pressure [1]. This may
potentially lead to retardation of the passive driven expiration and
dynamic lung inflation consecutively but more importantly increases

the work of breathing. The aim of this study was to compare the
resistive pressure drop of four commercially available neonatal ETTs
with internal diameter (ID) of 2.0 mm.

Methods The pressure-flow relationship of neonatal ETTs (internal
diameter 2.0 mm) of four different manufacturers (Mallinckrodt, Hi-
Contour, Covidien, Dublin, Ireland; Portex, Cole’s Neonatal Tube, Smith
Medical, St Paul, MN, USA; Rusch, Silko Clear, Teleflex Medical, Kernen,
Germany; and Vygon, Pediatric Endotracheal Tube, Ecouen, France)
was determined in a physical model consisting of a tube connector,
an anatomically curved ETT and an artificial trachea. The model was
ventilated with a sinusoidal gas flow with an amplitude of +100 ml/
second and a ventilation rate ranging from 40 to 60 cycles/minute. The
coefficients of an approximation equation considering ETT resistance
were fitted separately to the measured pressure-flow curves for
inspiration and expiration.

Results The pressure drop profiles of all errs. “re nonlinearly flow
dependent. The expiratory pressure drop (P._) slightly exceeded
the inspiratory one (P,,..). The ETT of Portex ae Neonatal Tube
had a significant lower pressure drop (P. 8.8 + 0.3 cmH,0 vs. P, exp
-11.2 + 0.2 cmH,0 at an air flow of 100 ml/second) compared with all
other ETTs (Mallinckrodt: P, asp 19-2 £0.4cmH, Ovs.P exp 724-3 £0. 7cmH,O;
Rusch: P,_., 28.3 + 0.8 cmH 0 vs. P, -33.0 + 0.8 cmH 50; Vygon: P..
19.2+0.4 cmH ,O vs. P, ,-22.6 0.6 cmH O, all P <0.05) for all flow and
ventilation rates, respectively.

Conclusion The ETT resistance highly contributes to the total airway
resistance in neonatal ventilation. The flow-dependent pressure drop
of shouldered Cole’s Neonatal Tube (Portex) was up to 70% less in
inspiration (resp. 67% in expiration) compared with straight tubes
with an internal diameter corresponding to the narrow part of Cole’s
tube. We conclude that neonatal intubation with a Cole's tube can
clearly reduce the resistive load due to the endotracheal tube and thus
potentially prevent additionally work of breathing.

Introduction Several factors can lead to weaning failure from
mechanical ventilation (MV). Among these, cardiac dysfunction is one
of the main causes. NT-proBNP has been proposed as a biomarker of
cardiovascular function during weaning from MV. Unfortunately it does
not provide for a continuous monitoring of cardiac function. Pulse
wave analysis may serve as a continuous bedside monitoring tool of
cardiovascular performance. Cardiac cycle efficiency (CCE) is an indirect
index of left ventricular performance obtained by the pulse contour
method MostCare (Vygon, Padova, Italy). The aim of this study was to
evaluate the correlation between NT-proBNP and CCE and the potential
usefulness of such variables during the weaning process from MV.
Methods Twenty-two long-term (>48 hours) mechanically ventilated
patients capable of performing a weaning trial of spontaneous
breathing (SBT) were enrolled in the study. Inclusion criteria were:
age >18 years and equipment with a standard arterial catheter line.
Exclusion criteria were: neuromuscular disease, tracheotomy, renal
failure, and traumatic brain injury. During the weaning process, NT-
proBNP plasma levels, CCE, and standard hemodynamic and ventilatory
data were collected 30 minutes before extubation (T1), 2 hours (T2)
and 12 hours later (T3). After removal of tracheal tube, patients with
a history of heart failure received continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP group). Patients with normal cardiac function were maintained
with spontaneous breathing (SB group).

Results Sixty-six paired NT-proBNP and CCE values were obtained.
Patients in the SB group and in the CPAP group were 10 and 12,
respectively. In both groups there was a trend towards an increase in
NT-proBNP values after extubation, an opposite trend was observed
regarding CCE values (P <0.05). NT-proBNP levels showed an increase

S60

after extubation (T2, T3) compared with T1; conversely, CCE showed
an inverse trend. Overall, a negative correlation was found between
NT-proBNP and CCE values (R = -0.81, P <0.001). Significant inverse
correlations were found between NT-proBNP and CCE at T1, T2, and
T3 (R = -0.91, -0.75 and -0.73 respectively; P < 0.001). The overall
correlation between NT-proBNP and CCE was -0.74 in the SB group and
—0.86 in the CPAP group. Standard hemodynamic and ventilatory data
did not show significant changes during the study.

Conclusion NT-proBNP correlated well with CCE. The latter seems to be
an additional attractive index of cardiovascular state that, in association
with NT-proBNP changes, may provide information about cardiac
function on a beat-by-beat basis during weaning process from MV.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P162 (doi: 10.1186/cc12100)

Introduction Tracheostomy is one of the more commonly performed
procedures in critically ill patients requiring long-term mechanical
ventilation. However, the optimal timing or method of performing
tracheostomies in this population remains to be established. In the
present study, we compared outcomes of early and late tracheostomy
in critically adult patients with different clinical conditions.

Methods All patients needing tracheostomy in the Critical Care
Medical Center of Hiroshima Prefectural Hospital from January 2009
to December 2011 were surveyed. Patients with tracheostomy who
were not indicated for mechanical ventilation were excluded from the
subjects. Early tracheostomy (ET) was defined as <10 days after tracheal
intubation and late tracheostomy (LT) was defined as =10 days after
intubation. We compared patient characteristics, type of tracheostomy
procedure, length of weaning from ventilator and outcomes between
the groups. Data are shown as the mean + SD, with unpaired t test
and Mann-Whitney U test used for statistical analyses. Statistical
significance was accepted at P <0.05.

Results One hundred patients were surveyed. The ET and LT groups
included 49 and 51 patients, respectively. Tracheostomy was performed
using a percutaneous procedure in 48 patients (ET: 25, LT: 23) and a
surgical procedure in 52 patients (ET: 24, LT: 28). Sixty-two patients (ET:
34, LT: 28) survived to discharge and 16 patients died in the ICU (ET:
7, LT: 9). Fifty-six patients (ET: 31, LT: 25) were weaned from ventilator
support and tracheostomy cannula was removed in 20 patients (ET:
11, LT: 9). There were no significant differences in type of tracheostomy
procedure, period from tracheostomy until ICU and hospital discharge,
rate of patients who could be weaned from ventilator and removed
tracheostomy cannula, and ICU and hospital mortality between the
groups. The length of mechanical ventilation and the time to removal
of tracheostomy cannula were significantly shorter in the ET group
(5+7vs.26+41 and 29 + 24 vs. 94 + 83 days, respectively).
Conclusion In this retrospective study, early tracheostomy reduced
the length of weaning after tracheostomy and the time to removal of
tracheostomy cannula, while there were no differences in the length of
ICU stay and patient outcome. In critically ill adult patients who require
mechanical ventilation, a tracheostomy performed at an earlier stage
may shorten the duration of artificial ventilation. A further randomized
clinical trial is essential to determine the effectiveness and safety of
early tracheostomy.

Introduction Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) remains
a frequently performed procedure in the ICU. However, there is great

----$$$$----$$$$----

variability in the course of blood vessels in the pre-tracheal area. A 5%
risk of clinically relevant bleeding was recently reported for patients
undergoing PDT [1]. We conducted a systematic review of reports
evaluating clinical outcomes following use of ultrasound scanning (US)
for PDT.
Methods Two investigators performed a search of the literature using
the following databases: CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE and SCOPUS.
The following eligibility criteria were used: population including adults
>16 years managed in the ICU; use of ultrasound to guide decision-
making pre-PDT or guide PDT performance; report of clinically relevant
outcome measures. Nonrandomised controlled trials were classified
according to Cochrane Non-Randomised Study Methods Group criteria
[2] and evaluated for risk of bias.
Results An initial search identified 2,043 reports, of which 10 studies
met eligibility criteria: eight case series, one randomised controlled trial
(RCT) and one prospective cohort study, incorporating 488 patients.
Two studies specifically reported data on patients with obesity (n = 29
patients) and one study reported data for a group of patients with
spinal cord fixation (n = 6). US was used to guide decision to perform
PDT or surgical tracheostomy in five studies, with decision to perform
surgical tracheostomy ranging from 0 to 27% of cases. US was used
to guide insertion point in seven studies, and used real-time in four
studies. Times to perform US-guided PDT were reported in four studies
(ranging from 8 to 12 minutes). No studies compared time taken with
or without US. Data on complications of procedure were reported
in nine studies. Minor bleeding was reported for eight cases (1.6%
overall). Prolonged bleeding was reported in two cases (0.4%). There
were no episodes of catastrophic bleeding among 488 cases. High risk
of bias was identified in five studies in terms of patient selection. An
intervention protocol was not defined in three reports. No attempt was
made at blinding any aspect of the 10 studies.
Conclusion Use of US guidance could theoretically help minimise risk
of haemorrhagic complications during PDT and perhaps reduce time
taken to perform PDT. However, there is currently inadequate evidence
from controlled cohort studies or RCTs to suggest that routine use
for PDT in selected or unselected groups improves clinically relevant
outcome measure.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P164 (doi: 10.1186/cc12102)

Introduction Failed airway situations are potentially catastrophic
events and require a correct approach with appropriate tools. Recently,
Ventrain has been presented as a manual device for emergency
ventilation through a small-bore cannula, which can provide expiratory
assistance by applying the Venturi effect.

Methods We used the SimulARTI Human Patient Simulator to evaluate
Ventrain. Initially, we studied the effectiveness and security in
ventilating and oxygenating the patient. In a second phase, the Ventrain
performance was compared with what is considered to be the present
gold standard (Quicktrach Il, Portex Mini-Trach Il Seldinger Kit, Melker
Emergency Cricothyrotomy Catheter Set). Seven anesthesiologists
performed an emergency transcricoid ventilation with each device in
the same setting.

Results Ventrain provided an average tidal volume of 334 ml and an
average minute volume of 2.4 | in the considered situation, with a
modification of PAO, from 32 to 702 mmHg and of PACO, from 54.5
to 38.8 mmHg. In the second phase, the time needed to obtain an
effective oxygenation with Ventrain was found to be shorter than
other devices (median difference; vs. Minitrach -60 seconds; vs. Melker
-35 seconds; vs. Quicktrach -25 seconds) (Figure 1); the ability to
remove CO, resulted bigger (average difference: vs. Minitrach -11.9;

Device for measuring bronchodilator delivery and response in
resource-limited settings

CW Carspecken, D Talmor

Introduction Effective delivery of aerosolized bronchodilators for
patients with asthma is crucial for adequate therapy in critical care
and emergent settings. Often administered with pressure-metered
dose inhalers (pMDIs), bronchodilator delivery depends on the correct
patient technique during administration [1] and the ability to measure
treatment response, which are difficult to monitor at the point of
care and particularly so in resource-poor settings where standard in-
hospital monitoring is unavailable [2].

Methods A point-of-care device for airflow measurement during
bronchodilator delivery was designed and tested for use in resource-
limited settings. The handheld device was constructed from a clinical
aerosol delivery tube with a bidirectional sensor for pressure differential
detection about the aerosol element (Figure 1). The custom low-cost

(<$11) electronics were designed such that no power supply would be
needed apart from a computer or mobile device. Collection of airflow
signal and calibration was performed with a standard 3 | syringe with
flow volume measurement on one adult subject.

Results Calibration of the assembled device over range of 0.5 to 3 I/
second enabled conversion of pressure difference to air flow with a
mean measured tube resistance of 0.258 (kPa*second)/I. Robust signal
responses to an adult subject’s continuous respiratory maneuvers on
the tube itself were demonstrated. Subject performance of the pMDI
technique with subsequent tidal volume breathing was recorded and
analyzed (Figure 1).

Conclusion Design and calibration of a novel low-cost monitoring
device for bronchodilator delivery monitoring enabled detection
and recording of characteristic flow volume respiratory patterns for
point-of-care diagnostics in resource-limited settings. Future work will
require clinical testing and automated detection of the correct pMDI
patient technique.

Introduction Protocol-based care of the tracheostomised patient is
important, as adverse events confer a high rate of mortality. Little is
known regarding the existence of formal evidence-based guidelines on
tracheostomy care. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic
review for evidence-based guidelines on adult tracheostomy care.
Methods A systematic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, guideline
clearinghouses, centres of evidence-based practice, and professional
societies’ guidelines relating to care of adult patients with a
tracheostomy was performed by two reviewers. In addition, a
Google search of publicly available tracheostomy care guidelines
was performed. Search terms: (tracheostom* OR tracheotom*) AND
(protocol* OR guideline* OR standard* OR management OR consensus
OR algorithm*). Filters: English language, human, from 1 January
1990 to date, adult patients. Guideline appraisal criteria: the quality
of guidelines retrieved was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines
Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument [1].
Results The search results are summarised in Table 1. A total of 80
guidelines were identified. Five were found to satisfy the AGREE II
criteria and only three related to the entire spectrum of tracheostomy
management. The majority was informal and was not published or
evidence based.
Conclusion Five evidence-based guidelines on adult tracheostomy
management were identified. This may represent a paucity of evidence
on the subject, suggesting that further clinical trials on the topic are
needed to contribute to the evidence base. This also highlights the
need for international consensus on the topic, to reduce duplication of
efforts, standardise practice, and improve outcomes.

Survey of emergency tracheostomy management in the East of
England region

N Lawrence, L Oakley, C Swanavelder, M Palmer

West Suffolk Hospital, Bury St Edmunds, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P167 (doi: 10.1186/cc12105)

Introduction The 4th National Audit Project of the Royal College
of Anaesthetists [1] concluded that the majority of airway-related
significant complications in ICUs resulted from displaced or blocked
tracheostomies and recommended together with the Intensive Care
Society and the National Tracheostomy Safety Project that each ICU
in the UK should have an emergency airway management plan and
guidelines [2]. The aim of this survey was to establish whether such
guidelines exist and are familiar to those working within the ICUs of the
East of England (EoE), their ease of availability in an emergency and the
degree of emergency tracheostomy training within the region.
Methods Data collection was via a telephone survey of 11 ICUs in the
EoE training region during July 2012 with one senior ICU nurse and one
ICU trainee questioned per hospital. Questions related to the existence
and accessibility of guidelines for tracheostomy emergencies, and to
the respondent's degree of emergency tracheostomy training and their
perceived availability of formal training.
Results All 11 ICUs questioned perform and manage tracheostomies. Of
22 respondents, 10 knew of guidelines covering all of the emergencies
described above and their location. Four respondents thought that
these guidelines were accessible in an emergency setting, one-half
of which were on computer systems requiring a login and search
function. With regards to emergency management, 19 respondents felt
competent in a tracheostomy emergency; almost exclusively through
experience and in-house teaching. No respondents were aware of any
formal emergency tracheostomy management courses.
Conclusion Despite national guidance within the UK this survey
highlights that implementation and awareness of emergency
tracheostomy guidelines in ICUs in the EoE region is poor, and when
present they are not readily accessible in an emergency. Emergency
training has largely been informal and the availability of formal training
courses has not been recognised. In order to improve patient safety
there is a need to ensure that emergency tracheostomy management
including guidelines, equipment and formalised tracheostomy
emergency training are adopted and embraced universally.

Can we keep neck breathers safe? A survey on training adequacy of
medical staff caring for tracheostomy/laryngectomy patients

Introduction A fatal incident related to a blocked tracheostomy
tube prompted a review in our Trust. To provide safe tracheostomy
care, changes in staffing, education and operational policies were
recommended. Training of potential first responders to tracheostomy
or laryngectomy emergencies remains outstanding. We aim to quantify
the training deficit. Tracheostomies are common in critical care but
these patients require ongoing management of an artificial airway on
discharge to the ward and even the community. In 2010 our critical care
unit cared for 108 tracheostomy patients, of which 30 were transferred
to the wards. The 4th National Audit Project highlighted complications
including hypoxic brain injury and death [1] and the National Patient
Safety Agency recognised a number of avoidable aspects [2]. Existing
guidelines for management of these patients including emergencies
are not widely known.

Methods An anonymous online survey was sent to all trainees who
may respond to a tracheostomy emergency in our organisation.
Trainees in anaesthesia/critical care, general medicine, general surgery,

S63

ENT, thoracics and A&E were approached. All completed forms were
included.

Results We achieved a response rate of 39% (65/168). Respondents
comprised: 33% anaesthesia/critical care, 47% medicine and 14%
surgery. Over one-half (36/65) had managed tracheostomy/laryngec-
tomy emergencies, with 42% (15/36) of these incidents occurring
on the wards and one in an outpatient clinic. Only 20% (13/65) had
received any formal training on management of a blocked/misplaced
tracheostomy tube and only 18% (12/65) were aware of any guidelines.
One-third of responders lacked confidence in management of these
emergencies and 88% felt they would benefit from formal training
including simulation.

Conclusion The population of patients with exteriorised tracheas is
increasing and represents a high-risk group. Management of airway
emergencies in these patients is not part of standard life-support
courses. According to our trainees, these scenarios are relatively
common and a significant proportion of first responders are poorly
equipped to deal with them. Our Trust will be including specific training
on the emergency management of neck breathers as part of in-house
resuscitation training. We would contend that national resuscitation
courses should consider doing the same.

Laryngeal mask as a safe and effective ventilatory device during
Blue Dolphin tracheostomy in the ICU

Introduction Usually percutaneous tracheostomy is accomplished via
the tracheal tube. Some severe complications during percutaneous
dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) may be related to poor visualization
of tracheal structures. The alternative implies extubation and re-
insertion of a laryngeal mask (LMA). An accidental extubation as well
as an injuring of the vocal cords (because of the inflated cuff during
dislocation) appears impossible in this method. Subjectively, the
bronchoscopic view obtained via a LMA seems to be better than that
obtained with an endotracheal tube (ET) [1,2].
Methods In this prospective observational study, the bedside PDT
was performed using the Ciaglia Blue Dolphin method in 150 critically
ill patients. The patient’s tracheal tube was exchanged for a LMA
Fastrach™ before undertaking PDT. The insertion of the LMA, the quality
of ventilation, the blood gas values, the view of the tracheal puncture
site, and the view of the balloon dilatation were rated as follows: very
good (1), good (2), barely acceptable (3), poor (4), and very poor (5).
Results PDTs with LMA were successful in 99.3% of the patients (n= 149).
The ratings were 1 or 2 in 96% of cases with regards to ventilation and
to blood gas analysis, in 96.6% for identification of relevant structures
and tracheal puncture site, and in 93.3% for the view inside the trachea
during PDT. A rating of 5 was assigned to one patient requiring tracheal
reintubation for inadequate ventilation. There were no damages to the
bronchoscope or reports of gastric aspiration.
Conclusion The Blue Dolphin PDT using a LMA showed definite
advantages regarding inspection of dilation process. This method
improves visualization of the trachea and larynx during a video-assisted
procedure and prevents the difficulties associated with the use of an
ET such as cuff puncture, tube transection by the needle, accidental
extubation, and bronchoscope lesions. The LMA results as an effective
and successful ventilatory device during PDT. This may be especially
relevant in cases of difficult patient anatomy where improved structural
visualization optimizes operating conditions. The intensivist performing
PDT should be scrupulous when deciding which method to use. In our
ICU the Blue Dolphin PDT with LMA has become the procedure of choice.

Introduction Balloon dilatational percutaneous tracheostomy with
radial outward dilation minimizes bleeding and injury to tracheal
rings [1]. Using the bronchoscope during the puncture of the trachea
holds a risk of inaccurate placement, of hypoventilation and of needle
puncturing the bronchoscope. This study was conducted in order to
evaluate the safety features and feasibility of combining real-time
ultrasound-guided puncture of the trachea with visualization of
the needle path during tracheal puncture [2]. We provide precise
localization of tracheal cartilage and proper site puncture for the stoma
by ultrasound, with subsequent performance of balloon dilatational
percutaneous tracheostomy using the Blue dolphin technique.
Methods Twenty-five patients including 15 males and 10 females,
mean age 61 years, with age range from 23 to 102 years, underwent
bedside percutaneous tracheostomy combining real-time ultrasound
and the Blue Dolphin technique.

Results The median time for the procedure was 15 (12 to 20) minutes.
Targeted placement for the tracheostoma between the second and
third or the third and fourth tracheal ring was achieved in 100%. No
significant complications (for example, tracheal bleeding, puncture
posterior tracheal wall, misplacement of the tracheal cannula) occurred.
One fractured tracheal ring was identified using bronchoscopy after
the procedure. No conversion into a bronchoscopically guided or into a
surgical open technique was necessary.

Conclusion This study demonstrates the feasibility and safeness
combining real-time ultrasound guidance and balloon dilatational
percutaneous tracheostomy (Blue Dolphin technique) in critically
ill patients. In our division, this technique has become the standard
bedside tracheostomy procedure because it combines excellent
patient safety features with avoidance of intraprocedural tube
misplacement, hypoventilation and accidental bronchoscopy damage
even in technically difficult cases [3].

Introduction Acute cor pulmonale (ACP) is associated with increased
mortality in patients ventilated for acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS). Interventional lung assist (iLA) allows a lung-protective
ventilatory strategy, whilst allowing CO, removal, but requires adequate
right ventricular (RV) function. RV restriction (including presystolic
pulmonary A wave) [1] is not routinely assessed in ARDS.

Methods A prospective analysis of retrospectively collected data
in patients with echo during iLA was performed. Data included
epidemiologic and ventilatory factors, LV/RV function, evidence of
RV restriction and pulmonary hemodynamics. Data are shown as
mean + SD/median (interquartile range).

Results Thirty-two patients (45 + 17 years), 22 male (68%), SOFA score
11.15 + 2.38 were included. Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) was 53%,
and hospital mortality 43%. Mortality was not associated with age,
days on iLA, length of ICU stay, inotropic support, nitric oxide or level
of ventilatory support, but was associated with pressor requirement
(P = 0.005), a worse PaO.:FiO, ratio (9.4 (7.8 to 12.6) vs. 15.2 (10.7 to
23.9), P = 0.009) and higher pulmonary artery pressures (56.5 mmHg
(50 to 60) vs. 44.5 (40.5 to 51.2), P= 0.02). No echo features of ACP were

found, with no significant difference between RV systolic function,
pulmonary acceleration time and pulmonary velocity time integral
between survivors and nonsurvivors. The incidence of RV restriction
was high (43%), and independent of PHT, RV systolic function and level
of respiratory support, but correlated with CO, levels (restrictive 7.1 kPa
(7.4 to 8.0) vs. 6.1 (5.8 to 6.8), P= 0.03). See Figure 1.

Conclusion Typical echo features of ACP were not seen in this study,
possibly because of the protective ventilatory strategies allowed by
use of iLA. The incidence of RV restriction may reflect more subtle
abnormalities of RV function. Further studies are required to elucidate
RV pathophysiology in critically ill adult patients with ARDS.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P172 (doi: 10.1186/cc121 10)

Introduction Global left ventricular electromechanical dyssynchrony
(GLVD) is uncoordinated LV contraction that reduces the extent of
intrinsic energy transfer from the myocardium to the circulation leading
to a reduction in peak LV pressure rise, prolonged total isovolumic
time (t-IVT) and fall in stroke volume [1]. This potentially important
parameter is not routinely assessed in critically ill cardiothoracic
patients.

Methods A prospective analysis of retrospectively collected data
in cardiothoracic ICU patients who underwent echocardiography
was performed. In addition to epidemiological factors, echo data
included comprehensive assessment of LV/RV systolic and diastolic
function including Doppler analysis of isovolumic contraction/
relaxation, ejection time (ET) and filling time (FT). t-IVT was calculated
as (60 - (total ET + total FT)) and the Tei Index as (ICT + IRT) / ET. t-IVT
>14 second/minute and Tei index >0.48 were used to define GLVD [2].
Data are shown as mean + SD/median (interquartile range).

Results A total of 103 patients (63.5 + 18.4 years), 65 male (63%), APACHE
Il score (14.6 + 7.4) were included. The prevalence of GLVD was high
(24/103, 22%) and associated with significantly increased mortality,
7.5% vs. 25% (P = 0.02). There was no difference in requirement for
cardiorespiratory support between the two populations, but there
were significant differences (no GLVD vs. GLVD) in requirement for

pacing (35% vs. 62%, P = 0.02), atrial fibrillation (20% vs. 41%, P = 0.03),
QRS duration (92.0 (80.0 to 120.0) vs. 116.5 (95.0 to 154.0), P=0.01) and
QTc (460.0 (416.0 to 498.5) vs. 477.5 (451.2 to 541.0), P = 0.02). There
was no significant difference in ejection fraction (no GLVD 43.0 (35.0
to 49.5) vs. GLVD 39.6 (29.5 to 49.7), P = 0.43), mitral regurgitation
(40.5% vs. 62.5%, P = 0.06), or any other measures of LV systolic or
diastolic function between the two groups. There was good correlation
between the two methods used to assess dyssynchrony (LV t-IVT:LV Tei
index correlation coefficient = 0.80, P <0.001).

Conclusion GLVD that limits cardiac output is common in the
cardiothoracic ICU, and significantly related to mortality. When
diagnosed, the underlying cause should be sought and treatment
instigated to minimize the t-iVT (pacing optimization/revascularization/
inotrope titration/volaemia optimization).

Safety of ultrasound-guided central venous access in critically ill
patients with uncorrected coagulopathy

Introduction Correction of coagulopathy before central venous
catheter (CVC) insertion is a common practice; however, when
ultrasound guidance is used this is controversial as mechanical
complications are rare. Studies in oncology patients suggest that CVC
placement without prior correction of coagulopathy is safe but no
studies are available for critically ill patients and guidelines do not give
recommendations [1,2]. We do not routinely correct coagulopathy,
even if severe, when ultrasound guidance is used and the purpose of
this retrospective study was to evaluate the safety of this practice.
Methods Data for all ultrasound-guided interventions, including
complications, are prospectively collected in our department for audit
purposes; in this study we involved only CVC insertions in the ICU
between February 2011 and November 2012. Electronic medical and
laboratory records and paper-based nursing charts were retrospectively
studied for all interventions, specifically looking for blood results,
coagulation abnormalities and intervention-related complications.
Results In the study period, ultrasound guidance was employed for a
total of 291 central line insertions in 220 ICU patients. Coagulopathy
was detected in 127 cases at the time of CVC placement (43.6%). On the
day of CVC insertion, coagulation abnormalities were corrected in 20
cases (15.7%); 33 out of 50 patients with severe coagulopathy (66.0%)
and 74 out of 77 patients with coagulopathy of moderate severity
(96.1%) had no correction at all. Correction was started only after CVC
insertion for reasons unrelated to CVC placement in a further eight
and two patients with severe and less severe coagulopathy (16.0% and
2.6%), respectively. No bleeding complications were observed.
Conclusion In patients undergoing CVC insertion in our ICU,
coagulopathy is common. We observed uncomplicated CVC placement
in all 41 patients with severe uncorrected coagulopathy and in a further
76 patients with coagulopathy of moderate severity. When combined
with other studies, our data suggest that ultrasound-guided CVC
placement without routine correction of coagulation abnormalities
may be safe in the ICU.

Cyanoacrylate glue prevents early bleeding of the exit site after CVC
or PICC placement

G Scoppettuolo, MG Annetta, C Marano, E Tanzarella, M Pittiruti

Catholic University, Rome, Italy

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P174 (doi: 10.1186/cc12112)

Introduction Early bleeding from the exit site after CVC or PICC
placement is a very common event that causes difficulties in the

S65

patient's care and logistical problems. In our experience, the rate of
significant local bleeding after placement of PICCs without reverse
tapering may be as high as 40% at 1 hour and 15% at 24 hours, while
the rate of bleeding after placement of a large-bore dialysis catheter is
above 50% at 1 hour.

Methods The aim of this pilot study was to verify the efficacy of a
cyanoacrylate glue in reducing the risk of early bleeding at the exit
site after CVC or PICC placement. We studied a group of adult patients
consecutively undergoing placement of polyurethane CVCs or PICCs
without reverse tapering in a non-intensive ward of our hospital. All
lines were inserted according to the same protocol, which included 2%
chlorhexidine antisepsis, maximal sterile barriers, ultrasound guidance,
EKG guidance and securement with sutureless device. Two minutes
after placement of the glue, the exit site was covered with a temporary
gauze dressing, which was replaced by transparent membrane at
24 hours. All patients were assessed at 1 hour and at 24 hours.

Results In 65 consecutive patients (45 PICCs, 11 dialysis catheters
and nine CVCs), there was no significant local bleeding at 1 hour or at
24 hours after catheter placement. No local adverse reaction occurred.
No damage to the polyurethane of the catheters was detected.
Conclusion Glue is an inexpensive and highly effective tool for avoiding
the risk of early bleeding of the exit site after catheter placement. We
also suggest that in the next future the glue might prove to have
beneficial collateral effects on the risk of extraluminal contamination
(by reducing the entrance of bacteria in the space between the catheter
and the skin), as well as on the risk of dislocation (by increasing the
stability of the catheter inside the skin breach).

Intracardiac ECG for confirmation of correct positioning of central
venous catheters is safe and cost-effective

M Eriksson, R Dérenberg

Surgical Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P175 (doi: 10.1186/cc12113)

Introduction About 10 years ago the use of chest radiographs as
the golden standard to ensure correct positioning of central venous
catheters (CVC) was questioned. The frequent use of CVCs was also
challenged. We decided to retrospectively evaluate our routines in a
large surgical unit in a Swedish university hospital.

Methods All X-rays were centrally registered. Chest X-ray performed in
our unit is almost entirely used to confirm CVC positioning. The Certofix
CVC set for the Seldinger technique in combination with Certodyn -
Universaladapter (B Braun, Germany) is now used as the routine
equipment and the right jugular vein is our standard approach.
Results In 2002 the total number of X-rays performed in patients at
our unit was 2,306, which corresponds to the approximate number
of inserted CVCs at that time, since a confirmatory X-ray was routine.
X-rays were rarely performed on other indications in our unit. X-ray
costs were at that time approximately €300,000 (~€130/each). The year
after, 1,726 chest X-rays were performed, reflecting both the use of
intracardiac confirmation of correct CVC position and also a reduced
use of CVCs. This trend has continued over time. In 2011 approximately
600 CVCs were inserted at our unit. X-rays were performed in about
20% of these cases. The cost for a chest X-ray is today ~€200, meaning
that X-ray costs were approximately €24,000. We have not experienced
any medical problems when intracardiac ECG was used for positioning
confirmation. On the contrary, aspiration of venous blood without
apparent p-waves in a patient with sinus rhythm may suggest improper
placement of the CVC; for example, the right brachial vein.

Conclusion If we had continued to use CVCs at the same frequency
as we did 10 years ago, and used X-ray confirmation in practically all
cases, we would have paid approximately €460,000 annually. Reduced
use of CVCs, in combination with intracardiac confirmation of CVC
positioning, has not only allowed us to reduce costs associated with
CVC insertion by more than €400,000, corresponding to a reduction
rate of more than 90%, but also decreased the patient's exposure to
X-ray irradiation.

Introduction In cases of arrhythmia, the beat-to-beat variation of
arterial pressure (AP) may impair the accuracy of automated cuff
measurements. Indeed, this oscillometric device relies on the detection
of arterial wall oscillations. Our aim was to determine, in ICU patients,
whether brachial cuff measurements are really less reliable during
arrhythmia than during regular rhythm.

Methods Patients with arrhythmia and carrying an_ intra-arterial
catheter were prospectively and consecutively included in this multi-
center study. After each arrhythmic inclusion, a regular rhythm patient
was included. A second inclusion was possible in case of change in
the cardiac rhythm. Three pairs of invasive and brachial cuff (Philips®
MP70 monitor) measurements of mean arterial pressure (MAP) were
respectively averaged. Some patients underwent a second set of
measurements, after a cardiovascular intervention (passive leg raising,
volume expansion, initiation of/increase in catecholamine infusion)
allowing the assessment of MAP changes.

Results In the 111 analyzed inclusions (in 103 patients) there was
only one failure in displaying a brachial cuff measurement of MAP.
Arrhythmic patients (atrial fibrillation 88%, frequent extrasystoles
7%, flutter 5%) were similar (P >0.3) to patients in regular rhythm
for MAP (median 74 (IQR 67 to 80) vs. 75 (69 to 84) mmHg), SAPS II
score, BMI, arm circumference, norepinephrine administration (36%
vs. 35%), mechanical ventilation (80% vs. 81%), and site of the intra-
arterial catheter (radial artery: 80% vs. 85%). Between arrhythmic
and regular rhythm patients: the agreement (Bland-Altman analysis)
between invasive and brachial cuff measurements of MAP was similar
(mean bias -0.4 + 7.2 (limits of agreement -14/14) mmHg vs. 3.0 + 8.2
(-13/19) mmHg, respectively); the detection of hypotension (invasive
MAP <65 mmHg) by the brachial cuff was of similar reliability (area
under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.91 (95% Cl = 0.80 to 0.97) vs. AUC = 0.98
(0.89 to 1), P= 0.2); and the detection of a response (>10% increase in
MAP) to therapy was of similar reliability (AUC = 1 (0.85 to 1) (n = 22) vs.
AUC = 0.99 (0.78 to 1) (n= 17), P=0.5).

Conclusion These preliminary results suggest that arrhythmia does not
impair the reliability of automated cuff measurements of MAP.

Introduction Significant changes in haemodynamics occur after brain
stem death (BSD) and there is evidence that yield of transplantable
organs may be decreased in donors who remain preload responsive
prior to donation [1], suggesting that optimisation of the cardiac
output (CO) may be beneficial in potential organ donors. We describe
current UK practice with regard to CO monitoring in this group.
Methods We reviewed a database of 287 brain-stem-dead potential
organ donors collected by specialist nurses in organ donation
(SN-OD) over a 6-month period (30 April 2011 to 31 October 2011)
across multiple UK centres. The database contained data on donor
management in the period from initial SN-OD review to immediately
prior to transfer to the operating theatre. We analysed data on CO
monitoring and vasopressor/inotrope use. Where information was
missing/not recorded in the dataset, the treatment referred to was
interpreted as not given/not done.

Results Fifty-three patients (18.5%) had evidence of CO monitoring.

LiDCO was the most popular method (Figure 1). A total of 264 (94%)

patients received treatment with vasopressors and/or inotropes. CO

data were utilised in a variety of ways (Figure 2).

Conclusion The majority of potential donors require vasopressors

and/or inotropes post BSD, but it seems only a minority currently have

their CO monitored. There is variation in how CO data are utilised to

direct haemodynamic management. We welcome the development of

standardised bundle-driven donor management.

Indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate for assessment

of liver function: re-evaluation of normal ranges and impact of
biometric data

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P178 (doi: 10.1186/cc121 16)

Introduction The indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate
(ICG-PDR) is a dynamic liver function test that can be non-invasively
measured by pulse densitometry. ICG-PDR is associated with mortality
and other markers of outcome. Due to predominant use of ICG-PDR
in the ICU setting, the normal range is based on scarce data available
outside the ICU and given with 18 to 25%/minute.

Methods To prospectively re-evaluate the normal range and to analyze
the potential impact of biometric data on ICG-PDR, we measured
ICG-PDR (i.v. injection of 0.25 mg/kg ICG; LIMON, Pulsion, Munich,

Germany) in 95 outpatients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Due to a
prevalence of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) of 5% in UC, patients
were asked regarding previous diagnosis of PSC. Additionally, serum
bilirubin, AST, ALT, INR, AP, yGT and cholinesterase were determined.
Association of biometric data (age, gender, height, weight) and
diagnosis of PSC on ICG-PDR were evaluated using Spearman corre-
lation, ROC and multivariate analysis (statistics: IBM SPSS 20).

Results A total of 95 patients (54 male, 41 female), age 43.2 + 15.5 (21 to
76) years, weight 74 + 16 kg, height 175 + 10 cm, BMI 23.7 + 4, bilirubin
0.48 + 0.27 mg/dl, AST 26.8 + 11.4 U/I, ALT 26.8 + 14.9 U/I, previous
diagnosis of PSC 8/95 (8.4%). ICG-PDR ranged from 13.8 to 44.0 with a
mean of 28.2 + 6.8 and a median of 27.0%/minute. In univariate analysis
ICG-PDR was significantly associated with age (r = —0.480; P <0.001),
weight (r = -0.262; P = 0.011) and female gender (r = 0.221; P = 0.032),
but not to height (P = 0.681). In multivariate analysis (R = 0.459)
including the variables age, gender, height, weight and diagnosis of
PSC, only age was independently (P <0.001) associated with ICG-PDR.
With each year in age, ICG-PDR decreased by 0.206%/minute. In ROC
analysis, |CG-PDR above the upper normal range (>25%/minute) was
significantly associated with young age (AUC 0.746; P <0.001).
Conclusion ICG-PDR (normal) values should be corrected for age. With
a decrease in ICG-PDR of 0.206% per year, the range between the upper
and lower normal level (25 to 18%/minute) is passed through within
about 35 years of life. These findings are in accordance with functional
loss of other organ functions (for example, cardiac output, glomerular
filtration rate) with increasing age. Normal ranges of innovative
markers of organ function mainly derived from ICU populations should
be re-evaluated outside the ICU.

rate, other markers of hepatic function and transpulmonary
thermodilution parameters: a prospective study in 154 patients

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P179 (doi: 10.1186/cc12117)

Introduction Hepatic dysfunction has been associated with outcome of
ICU patients. However, most scoring systems including APACHE II only
marginally reflect acute liver dysfunction on admission. Indocyanine
green (ICG) is eliminated by hepatobiliary excretion. Therefore, the
ICG plasma disappearance rate (ICG-PDR) is used as a dynamic liver
function test. ICG-PDR has been associated with mortality in several
studies.

Methods A prospective study to compare prediction of 28-day
mortality by ICG-PDR, other markers of liver function and scoring
systems (primary endpoint). In the subgroup of patients with trans-
pulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) monitoring (PiCCO device; Pulsion,
Munich, Germany), predictive capabilities of ICG-PDR were compared
with cardiac index (Cl), extravascular lung water index (EVLWI),
global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI) and pulmonary vascular
permeability index (PVPI). ICG-PDR (i.v. bolus of 0.25 mg/kg ICG; LIMON
device, Pulsion) and all other predictors were determined within
48 hours after admission. Statistics: IBM SPSS 20.

Results A total of 154 patients (46 female, 108 male), age 59 + 13 years,
APACHE II score 16.0 + 5.7, SOFA score 7.6 + 4.2. Etiology: sepsis 14.4%,
cirrhosis 28.8%, GI bleeding 8.9%, ARDS 17.8%, cardiogenic shock
4.1%, acute renal failure 3.4%, various 22.6%. The 28-day mortality was
significantly predicted by APACHE II (ROC-AUC: 0.762; P <0.001) and
SOFA (AUC: 0.784; P <0.001). Among markers of hepatic function on
admission, ICG-PDR provided the largest AUC (0.742; P <0.001), which
was larger than for GOT (AUC: 0.646; P = 0.019), bilirubin (AUC: 0.641;
P=0.023) and INR (AUC: 0.614; P= 0.067). Among TPTD parameters, only
PVPI significantly predicted 28-day mortality (AUC: 0.643; P = 0.043),
whereas Cl, GEDVI and EVLWI were not predictive. Prediction of 28-day
mortality by SOFA could not be improved by models including any
hepatic parameter. By contrast, ICG-PDR was independently (P = 0.036)
associated with mortality when included in a model (R = 0.58) with
APACHE Il. This model based on APACHE II and ICG-PDR provided
the largest of all ROC-AUCs (AUC: 0.804; P <0.001). ICG-PDR itself was

S67

independently associated with age (P = 0.025), but not with any other
biometric parameter (gender, weight and height).

Conclusion ICG-PDR on admission is an independent predictor of
28-day mortality. Predictive capabilities particularly of APACHE II can
be improved by combination with ICG-PDR. Among TPTD-derived
parameters, only PVPI provides significant prediction of mortality.

Mixed and central venous oxygen saturation are not
interchangeable in patients with cardiogenic shock after cardiac
surgery

S Romagnoli, P Balsorano, F Landucci, A De Gaudio

AOUC Careggi, Florence, Italy

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P180 (doi: 10.1186/cc12118)

Introduction Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO,) represents a
well-recognized parameter of oxygen delivery (DO,)-consumption
(VO,) mismatch and its use has been advocated in critically ill patients
in order to guide hemodynamic resuscitation [1] and oxygen delivery
optimization. Nevertheless, the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is not
readily available and its use is not devoid of risks. Furthermore, its use
has been decreasing in recent years in surgical and cardiac surgical
patients as the benefit of guiding therapy with this device is unclear
[2-4]. Central venous oxygen saturation (ScVO,) has been suggested
as an alternative to SVO, monitoring due to its feasibility in several
settings. Unfortunately concerns arise from its capability to correlate
with SVO,, the relationship being influenced by several factors, such
as hemodynamic impairment and pathological process. Hemodynamic
instability and shock often complicate cardiac surgery, and the SVO,-
ScVO, relationship has not been specifically investigated in this setting.
The aim of this study is to compare SVO, and ScVO, values in patients
with cardiogenic shock after cardiac surgery.

Methods A prospective observational study was designed and
conducted. Inclusion criteria were: patients who had underwent
elective or urgent/emergent cardiac surgery, with cardiac index (Cl)
<2.5 I/minute/m? estimated by means of a PAC, left ventricle ejection
fraction (LVEF) <40%, lactate >2 mmol/l, age >18 years. A central venous
catheter (CVC) and a PAC were inserted for each patient before surgery
in the same right internal jugular vein in accordance with standard
procedure. Proper position of the PAC was confirmed with pressure
tracings and chest X-ray. Mixed and central venous blood samples
were collected from the distal ports of the PAC and CVC respectively
30 minutes after ICU admission, and every 6 hours for a total of three
samples in a 24-hour period for each patient. All blood samples were
analyzed by a co-oximeter (Radiometer ABL800 flex; Radiometer,
Copenhagen, Denmark). Statistical analysis was performed by Stats
Direct (Ver.2.5.8, Cheshire, UK) and GraphPad (Vers. Prism 4.0; San
Diego, CA, USA). All data were tested for normal distribution with the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Statistical analysis was performed by linear
regression analysis. The agreement between absolute values of ScvO,
and SvO, were assessed by the mean bias and 95% limits of agreement
(LOA) ((mean bias + 1.96)xstandard deviation) according to the method
described by Bland and Altman [5].

Results A total of 20 patients were enrolled. In 18 out of 20 cases all
three blood samples were collected. In two patients only two blood
samples were drawn as they exited the inclusion criteria. Linear
regression analysis between the two variables resulted in an r’ of 0.708.
Bland-Altman analysis (Figure 1) for the pooled measurements of SvO,
and ScvO, showed a mean bias and LOA of 6.82% (SD of bias 5.3) and
-3.71 to +17.3% respectively.

Conclusion ScVO, has been advocated as an attractive and simple
indicator of DO,-VO, mismatch [6]. Its role as a surrogate of the well-
established SVO, has been investigated in several settings, and it
has been purposed in the hemodynamic resuscitation of critically
ill septic patients [1]. Nevertheless, the SVO,-ScVO, relationship
can be influenced by several factors due to ScVO, dependency from
global blood flow redistribution that can occur during hemodynamic
impairments. It has been shown previously that in healthy people
ScVO, values tend to underestimate SVO, values, due to the higher
oxygen content from inferior vena cava [7]. During circulatory shock,
not homogeneous oxygen extraction and regional blood flow

L

redistribution make SVO, a more reliable parameter suggesting the
global adequacy of cardiac output rather than ScVO.. In this study
we aimed at evaluating SvO,-ScVO, differences in patients with
cardiogenic shock, as defined by hyperlactatemia, low Cl, and LVEF
<40%, after cardiac surgery. Our results highlighted a great variability
for these two parameters, with a clinically unacceptable mean bias and

LOA. As expected, ScVO, values were consistently higher.

Introduction The acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary
hypertension (PH) is one of the factors of septic mortality. Some data
demonstrate arginine deficiency as an important pathogenic factor of
septic PH. We suppose that intravenous L-arginine infusion improves
NO production and reduce PH.

Methods We examined 46 patients with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic
shock in accordance with San Antonio Criteria. Organ dysfunction
severity was defined according to SOFA. The mean pulmonary artery
pressure (MPAP) was estimated by Doppler method, cardiac output
(CO), and stroke volume (SV) — by ultrasound M-mode. SpO., mean
arterial pressure (MAP), blood gas, and plasma NO level was evaluated.
The patients of Group 1 (n = 21, age 22.1 + 8.5 months) had respiratory
and hemodynamic support, and antibiotics. Group 2 (n = 25, age
27.0 + 11.2 months) had the same treatment with continuous i.v.
infusion of 5 ml/kg body weight 4.2% L-arginine solution during
24 hours.

Results The patients of Groups 1 and 2 did not have statistical
difference of SOFA (4.1 + 1.0 vs. 4.4 + 0.7), need for ventilator support
(57.0 + 11.0% vs. 44.0 + 10.0%), and dose of inotropes (P >0.05). The
reduction of MPAP and increase of SaO, was significantly higher in

Introduction While TEE is providing a direct assessment of the cardiac
function and volume status as a diagnostic tool, until recently it has
been impractical to be continuously available for monitoring. A new
disposable, monoplanar TEE probe (ImaCor) can remain in the patient
for up to 72 hours, allowing repeated measures of ventricular function
and volume status, parameters needed to monitor response to therapy.
Methods We assessed the benefit these TEE data provided in the
assessment of five domains: hypovolemia, right ventricular dysfunction,
left ventricular dysfunction, sepsis, and valvular abnormality. Bedside
practitioners listed their diagnoses before and after seeing primary
TEE images perform by trained physicians. We used a 0 to 5 Likert scale
to assess differential diagnosis before and after the TEE, comparing
changes using a paired f test.

Results All requests for TEE were to access hemodynamic instability. A
total of 18 patients were screened and nine were eligible, in which 16
total TEE studies were performed. There were no complications with
TEE and all patients tolerated the long-term placement of the probe
well. Of the five diagnostic domains studied, right ventricular failure was
the most commonly underdiagnosed contributor to the hemodynamic
instability among patients prior to TEE (P = 0.054) (Figures 1 and 2).

Introduction Although rapid progress in ICU monitoring with advanced
equipments has been developed, there were limited data on ICU
monitoring in Thailand. The objective of this study was to determine
the current utilization of monitoring in Thai ICUs.

Methods A self-administered questionnaire was developed by the
TSCCM research subcommittee. Data verification was processed by an
online medical research tools program (OMERET).

Results A total of 350 questionnaires were sent to ICUs throughout
Thailand. In total, 256 questionnaires were confirmed after being
received at the end of June 2012. Of these, 140 filled forms (56.9%)
were returned for final analysis. More than 70% of the ICUs had basic
hemodynamic monitoring. Less than 10% of general and regional
hospitals could perform cardiac output monitoring by thermodilution
technique compared with 60% of academic teaching hospitals.
New and advanced hemodynamic monitoring techniques such as
pulse pressure variation, systolic pressure variation, stroke volume
variation, PiCCO, Vigileo-Flo Tract, Pleth variability index device and
echocardiography were available only in ICUs of academic teaching
hospitals except ultrasound-based techniques including transthoracic
and transesophageal echocardiography and USCOM. For respiratory
monitoring, all ICUs had a SpO, monitoring device but only one-half of
them had end-tidal CO, monitoring. Nearly 80% of ventilator support
in participating ICUs was capable of displaying graphic waveform
monitoring. Only 43.6% of participating ICUs had a ventilator machine
that could calculate lung mechanics data. Advanced respiratory
monitoring such as EIT and esophageal pressure monitoring are
available only in ICUs of academic teaching hospitals. There was no

S69

ICU in Thailand that was capable of measuring extravascular lung
water. None of the Thai ICUs used transcutaneous PCO,, near-infrared
spectroscopy, gut mucosal tonometry and sublingual sidestream dark-
field for tissue perfusion monitoring. Only four !CUs had transcutaneous
PO,. However, measuring the level of lactate as one of the tissue
perfusion markers was routinely performed in about 50% of the ICUs.
Conclusion There were variations in monitoring performance in Thai
ICUs. These vary by type of hospital. Academic ICUs had a tendency for
advance monitoring in overall aspects. Some advance monitoring used
in developed countries is also unavailable in Thailand.

Introduction Echocardiography is increasingly utilized by intensive care
physicians in everyday practice. Standardization of echocardiographic
studies and reporting, quality assurance and medicolegal requirements
necessitate establishment of a dedicated system within the critical
care setting. We describe the process of setting up a critical care
echocardiography (CCE) laboratory based on our experience from
three separate ICUs.

Methods A retrospective review and analysis of the process involved in
establishment of echocardiography laboratories within ICUs.

Results Creating a CCE service involves a number of stages and
takes several years to achieve. Major components include staffing,
equipment, quality control, study archiving and networking capability.
For staffing the objective is to identify and recruit staff with adequate
training and expertise in CCE, providing 24/7 specialist cover in
addition to supporting and training junior medical and nursing staff.
There is further a need to acquire funding for high-quality ultrasound
machines and related hardware as well as long-term DICOM-based
archiving and reporting systems. This should be based on projections
of annual volumes of echo studies and corresponding digital storage.
Networking connectivity is highly desirable, including obligatory
back-up solutions and site allocations. A business case incorporating
all the above should precede any development as identifiable funding
sources and administrative approval are essential. The implementation
stage requires the presence of a project leader who can organize the
trialing of scanners, archiving, reporting and research systems, ensure
compatibility with existing hospital and cardiology networks, and who
can assist in individualizing archiving and reporting software reflecting
institutional and ICU specifics. Coordination with the IT department
is very important. Clear contractual vendor obligations for service,
maintenance and future upgrades of hardware and software need to
be specified. Training and credentialing of staff is best achieved within
a systematic framework that includes ongoing competency review,
education and QA programs. Partnership with cardiology may benefit
both groups. Major pitfalls are associated with poor initial training, lack
of expertise and leadership, and bad vendor contracts.

Conclusion Establishment of a CCE laboratory requires careful
planning, and allocation of adequate human and financial resources.
Many potential problems can be identified and prevented in advance.
Strong expert leadership plays an important role.

Introduction Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) is a
dynamic digital ultrasound-based imaging technique, which allows
quantification of the microvascularisation up to the capillary vessels. As
a novel method for assessment of tissue perfusion it is ideally designed
for use in the ICU. CEUS is cost-effective and safe and can be repeatedly
performed at the bedside without radiation and nephrotoxicity.

Methods The frequency of CEUS use in the multidisciplinary surgical
ICU was retrospectively evaluated for the period from 1 September
2011 to 1 September 2012. Furthermore, contributions of this novel
method to the management of critically ill ICU patients as well as its
accuracy were assessed.

Results In total, 33 CEUS studies were performed in critically ill ICU
patients. The most frequent indications included: assessment of the
liver perfusion, assessment of the pancreas and kidney perfusion after
pancreas and kidney transplantation, assessment of the renal perfusion
in acute kidney injury (AKI), assessment of active bleeding and
assessment of the bowel perfusion. In all studies, the correct diagnosis
was achieved and the transport of critically ill patients to the radiology
department for further diagnostic procedures as well as application
of iodinated contrast agents was avoided. In 16 cases significant new
findings were detected. Twelve of them were missed by conventional
standard Doppler ultrasound prior to CEUS. In assessment of seven
cases with AKI, impaired or delayed perfusion and microcirculation
of the kidney was observed in six patients. In three patients urgent
surgical intervention was performed because of CEUS results. In three
cases active bleeding was excluded at the bedside due to absence of
contrast agent extravasation into hematoma (thigh and perihepatic) or
into abdominal cavity, without need for complementary CT imaging or
angiography. In one case the regular perfusion of intestinal anastomosis
was confirmed with no need for surgical exploration. None of patients
undergoing CEUS manifested any adverse reactions or developed any
complications associated with the imaging technique.

Conclusion Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography clearly improves
visualization of the perfusion in various tissues. It is very likely to be
superior to standard Doppler ultrasound, and is safe and well tolerated
in critically ill patients. Promising indications for the use of CEUS in the
ICU may be the assessment of kidney microcirculation and assessment
of liver perfusion in liver transplant and liver trauma patients.

Introduction Even though invasive hemodynamic devices are usually
used for assessment of septic shock victims, they cannot evaluate the
heart function. LV dysfunction as well as right heart syndrome are not
uncommon in sepsis and critical patients. Intensive care ultrasound
discloses these data and leads to appropriate treatment.

Methods The study was a prospective cross-sectional study. The
measurement was performed within 24 hours of ICU admission. We
excluded patients with history of COPD and pulmonary hypertension
from any diseases. Only good-quality images acquired from subjects
were included for analysis. The primary objective was to disclose how
the hemodynamic changed in septic patients by ICU-US.

Results A total of 133 septic patients were measured by ICU-US. Good
image quality was acquired in 115 cases (86.47%). The mean ages were
57.48 + 17.87 years. The three major causes of sepsis were pneumonia,
unknown source, abdominal infection and bacteremia. Heart failure at
admission was found only in 1.79%. Previous history of hypertension,
DM, and coronary artery disease was found in 12.17%, 11.30%, and
1.74% of patients. The mean LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was 54 + 15.43%.
The percentages of patients with LVEF <35%, 35 to 40%, 41 to 45%
and >45% were 13.2%, 7.5%, 8.5%, and 70.8% respectively. Diastolic
dysfunction defined by E/A ratio <1 was observed in 47.5% of patients.
A total 44.6% of cases had cardiac output under 4 |I/minute whereas
CO over 6 I/minute was found in 18.1% of cases. The average mean
pulmonary artery pressure was 34.75 + 15.13 mmHg. The proportion of
patients with meanPAP over 25 mmHg was 76.2%. RV to LV ratio >1 was
found in 42.4% of septic patients.

Conclusion Cardiac dysfunction, namely left ventricle and probably
right ventricle, was not uncommon in septic shock patients. Without
intensive care ultrasound, all crucial information was delayed until
patient deterioration and initial treatment may be harmful. Thus
cardiac ultrasound should be used initially to disclose hemodynamic
features before routine resuscitation is initiated.

Introduction Speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) has emerged as
an ultrasound technique for accurately evaluating myocardial function
also in critically ill patients. By tracking the displacement of the speckles
during the cardiac cycle, the strain rate can be measured offline after
adequate image acquisition. The aim of the study was to evaluate the
effects of the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on four-chamber
longitudinal strain (LS) analysis in critically ill patients.

Methods We enrolled 20 consecutive patients (mean age 64 + 18) who
needed mechanical ventilation and were admitted to the ICU due to
heterogeneous causes. Inclusion criteria were: hypoxia requiring PEEP
titration, invasive arterial pressure monitoring, age >18. Exclusion
criteria were: myocardial dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias and
valvular pathologies. The same operator performed three standard
echocardiography measurements (MyLab 70 Xvision; Esaote), each
of them after having increased PEEP at 5, 10, and 15 cmH,O (T1, T2,
T3, respectively). Blood gas analysis, respiratory, and hemodynamic
parameters provided by a pulse contour method were also recorded.
STE analysis was performed offline (XStrain™MyLab 70 Xvision; Esaote).
Results Left peak atrial LS (LA-PALS) was significantly reduced from
T1 to T2, and from T2 to T3 (40.2 + 12%, 35.9 + 9%, 28.4 + 8%, T1,
T2, T3, respectively; P <0.05). Right peak atrial LS (RA-PALS) and
right ventricular (RV)-LS showed a significant reduction only at T3
(RA-PALS: 44.7 + 48.5% at T1, 35.9 + 11% at T3; RV-LS: -20.2 + 2% at
T1,-16.3 + 1.1% at T3; P <0.05). Left ventricular (LV)-LS did not change
significantly during titration of PEEP. Cardiac chambers’ volumes and
cardiac output (CO) showed a significant reduction at higher levels of
PEEP. Pulse pressure variation was significantly affected by higher levels
of PEEP (P <0.05).

Conclusion In hypoxic patients with normal cardiac function, PEEP
titration determined a reduction of LA-LS, RA-LS and RV-LS values.
LV-LS values were not influenced by PEEP changes. The fall in CO,
observed with higher values of PEEP, seemed to be related to the
impairment of preload and not of myocardial contractility. Whenever
interpreting data on cardiac function obtained with longitudinal strain
analysis, attention of the clinician should be drawn to different levels
of PEEP. The higher the PEEP, the more the probability of misleading
interpretation of STE data.

Evaluation of a new calibration index suggesting recalibration of
the pulse contour cardiac index by transpulmonary thermodilution:
a prospective study

Introduction After calibration by thermodilution (TD), the PiCCO
device is able to assess cardiac index (Cl) using pulse contour (PC)
analysis. The manufacturer suggests recalibration by TD after 8 hours.
Recently, we suggested a calibration index indicating a certain
probability of a relevant bias and triggering the next calibration. With
changes of Clpc compared with the previous Cltd being a key predictor
of the bias of Clpc compared with the following Clitd, the manufacturer
implemented a soft alarm indicating changes in Clpc compared with
the last Cltd (thresholds adjustable to 15%, 25% and 35%). The aim of

----$$$$----$$$$----

the study was prospective evaluation of predictive capabilities of the
15% alarm regarding a bias of Clpc compared with Cltd exceeding
critical thresholds of 15%, 20% and 25%.

Methods A prospective analysis of 329 routine TPTD measurements
in 70 patients. The Cl-trend alarm was set to 15%, and Clpc, trend
alarm (yes/no), relative and absolute changes in Clpc were recorded
immediately before TD providing exact measurement of Cltd. Predictive
capabilities of the 15% trend alarm regarding the bias were evaluated
using Spearman correlation, chi-square test, ROC analysis and Wilcoxon
test (IBM SPSS 20).

Results A total of 70 patients (24 female, 46 male), age 62 + 14 years,
APACHE II score 19.5 + 7.5, SOFA score 8.9 + 4.4. At 937 + 904 (50 to 5,795)
minutes after the last Cltd, Cloc provided a bias of -0.0566 + 0.761 I/
minute*m* compared with the next Cltd. Percentage error was 34.6%.
Absolute and relative bias of Cloc compared with the new Cltd did not
correlate to time to last TD, but correlated (all P <0.001) to Clpc itself
(r = 0.333; r = 0.385) and relative (r = 0.531; r = 0.537) and absolute
(r = 0.533; r= 0.529) changes in Clpc compared with last Cltd. The 15%
Clpc trend alarm was indicated before 83/329 measurements (25.2%).
The amount of bias exceeded 15% and 20% in 101 (30.7%) and 79
(24%) of TDs. In TDs with indicated trend alarm (=15% deviation of Clpc
to the last Cltd), the amount of bias more frequently exceeded 15%
(P = 0.019), 20% (P <0.001) and 25% (P <0.001). Time to last calibration
>8 hours was not associated with bias exceeding 15% (P = 0.735), 20%
(P = 0.888) or 25% (P = 281).

Conclusion Bias of Clpc compared with the next Cltd does not depend
on the time since last Cltd. Changes in Clpc itself compared with the
last Cltd are associated with the bias. A 15% change in Clpc trend alarm
provided by the new PiCCO algorithm is significantly associated with
bias values exceeding 15%, 20% or 25% of Cltd, whereas time to last
calibration >8 hours is not associated with bias exceeding these critical
thresholds.

Introduction Thermodilution (TD) is considered a gold standard for
measurement of cardiac index (Cl) in critically ill patients. The aim of
this study is to compare intermittent bolus TD Cl with intermittent
automatic calibration Cl (AutoCl) and two continuous Cls obtained by
pulse contour analysis with PiCCO, (PiCCl) and Pulsioflex (PuCCl).
Methods Interim results of an ongoing prospective multicentre study
in 53 patients. Age 58.7 + 15.4, SAPS Il score 51.4 + 14.7 and SOFA score
10 + 3.2. All patients underwent PiCCO monitoring via a femoral line
whilst a radial line was kept in place during four 8-hour time periods
(in the first two periods, the Pulsioflex was connected to a radial line;
in the last two it was connected to a femoral line). In the first and third
periods, the Pulsioflex was calibrated with TDCI, for the second and
fourth periods Pulsioflex was calibrated with AutoCl. Simultaneous
PiCCl and PuCCl measurements were obtained every 2 hours while
simultaneous TDCI and AutoCl were obtained every 8 hours. We also
looked at the effects of 40 interventions.

Results In total, 940 CCI and 382 TDCI values were obtained: 940 paired
PiCCI and PuCCl; 358 paired AutoCl-TDCI measurements. TDCI values
ranged from 1.5 to 6.9 I/minute/m? (mean 3.6 + 1.1), AutoCl from 1.8
to 7.2 (3.6 + 0.9), PiCCI from 1.0 to 7.1 (3.5 + 1.1) and PuCCl from 1.3 to
7.6 (3.6 + 1). Pearson’s correlation coefficient comparing mean PuCCl
and PiCCl values per patient had an R? of 0.79. Comparison between
AutoCl and TDCI had an R? of 0.51. Changes in AutoCl correlated well
with changes in TDCI (R? = 0.44, concordance coefficient = 95.7), as
did changes in PuCCl versus changes in PiCClI (R? = 0.99, CC = 93.4%).
Changes in PiCCl and PuCCl induced by an intervention correlated
well with each other (R? = 0.86, CC = 100%). The percentage error
(PE) obtained by Bland and Altman analysis and R? for the different
comparisons are presented in Table 1.

Conclusion The preliminary results indicate that in unstable critically
ill patients, Cl can be reliably monitored with Pulsioflex technology via
a femoral line. Pulsioflex was also able to keep track of changes in Cl.

Introduction The Nexfin monitor (BMEYE, the Netherlands) enables
continuous non-invasive analysis of blood pressure (MAP) as well as
cardiac output (CO) measurements. The aim of the present study was
to validate the Nexfin in a mixed population of medical ICU patients.
Methods Interim results of a prospective ongoing study in 77 patients
admitted to the medical ICU (46 patients mechanically ventilated, M/F
ratio 1/1). Age 65.6 + 15.9, BMI 25.6 + 4.8, APACHE II score 22.9 + 10.9,
SAPS II 48 + 20.1, SOFA score 7.5 + 4.5. A modified outreach score (SOS)
was calculated on admission. For all patients, simultaneous recording
of arterial pressure by radial line (n = 78), PiCCO (n = 44) or by NIBP with
arm cuff (n = 47) was compared with the Nexfin monitor. Statistical
analysis was performed with Student's t test, Pearson correlation and
Bland-Altman analysis.

Results A total of 103 measurements in 77 patients were performed.
In seven patients measurement with Nexfin was not possible. For CO
(55 paired measurements), values were 6 + 2.1 I/minute (range 2.6
to 12). Pearson's correlation coefficient comparing Nexfin-CO with
reference CO showed a good correlation (R* = 0.52). Bland-Altman
analysis comparing both CO techniques revealed a mean bias + 2SD
(LA) of 0.3 + 3.6 I/minute (58% error). The MAP was 84.2 + 15.6 mmHg
(53 to 131.5) and values obtained with the Nexfin correlated well
with the reference method with an R? of 0.72. Bland-Altman analysis
comparing both MAP techniques revealed a mean bias + 2SD (LA) of
-0.3 + 18 mmHg (20.9% error). However, Nexfin-MAP did not correlate
well with NIBP (R? = 0.36). Hemoglobin values obtained with Nexfin
Massimo technique did not correlate well with laboratory values
(R? = 0.26, 33% error). The 26 patients that died in the ICU had higher
APACHE II (P = 0.017), SAPS II (P <0.0001), SOFA (P <0.0001) and SOS
(P = 0.004) scores and significantly lower MAP (P <0.0001), hemoglobin
(P = 0.01) and lower dp/dtmax (P = 0.003), a marker for contractility.
There were no outcome differences with regard to subgroup analysis in
patients with either low or high CO or SVR.

Conclusion In unstable critically ill patients, MAP (and CO) can be
monitored with the Nexfin. The exact patient population for this

Cost-effectiveness analysis of stroke volume variation guided
perioperative hemodynamic optimization

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P191 (doi: 10.1186/cc12129)

Introduction Perioperative goal-directed therapy (pGDT) can sub-
stantially improve the outcome of high-risk surgical patients [1]. But the
approach needs an initial investment and increases the staff workload.
Economic factors might participate in the weak adherence to the
pGDT concept. Some model studies support pGDT cost-effectiveness,
but real economic data based on a recent clinical trial are lacking. We
performed an economic analysis of hemodynamic optimization using
the stroke volume variation trial [2] in order to elucidate this issue.
Methods The hospital care invoices of all 120 patients included in the
trial were retrospectively extracted. Due to the nature of the data we
have adopted the healthcare payer's perspective. We performed a
comparison of induced costs between the Vigileo (n = 60) and Control
(n = 60) groups and constructed a cost tree using the study group and
complications occurrence as distributive parameters. The incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio per complication avoided was calculated and,
finally, different reimbursing categories were assessed as potential cost
drivers.
Results A decreased rate (18 vs. 35 patients) and number of
complications (34 vs. 78) were observed in the original trials Vigileo
group. The mean cost of intervened patient was lower (€2,877 + 2,336
vs. €3,371 + 3,238; P = 0.38). According to the cost-tree analysis,
patients with complications (n = 53; 44%) consumed significantly more
resources (€235,623; 63%). A gain of €634 per avoided complications
confirms that the lower complications rate was the most important cost
driver. Both the clinical care for patients costs (€505 vs. 912; P = 0.04)
and ward stay costs (€244 vs. 402; P = 0.03) were decreased by the
intervention. On the contrary, the intervention increased anaesthesia
costs (€880 vs. 688; P = 0.001).
Conclusion Intraoperative fluid optimization with the use of stroke
volume variation and the Vigileo/FloTrac system showed not only a
substantial improvement of morbidity, but was also associated with an
economic benefit. This observed benefit highly exceed the increased
monitoring costs in our trial.

(EVLWI) reflects pulmonary edema [2]. The new EV1000/VolumeView
(Edwards Lifesciences) can accurately measure EVLWI corrected for the
actual volume of lung parenchyma (EVLWIc). The aim of our study is to
prove a stronger correlation between EVLWic and PaO,/FiO, compared
with EVLWI in patients undergoing pulmonary resection.

Methods A prospective observational study. Seven patients with
lung cancer undergoing pulmonary resection were monitored using
the EV1000 plathform. EVLWI was assessed by thermodilution at
the following time points: after intubation (t1); during single-lung
ventilation (t2); after lung resection (t3); after ICU admission (t4);
12 hours (t5) and 18 hours after ICU admission (t6). EVLWIc values were
also collected at t3 and t4. PaO,/FiO, was measured at the same time
points.

Results No significant correlation was found between EVLWI and PaO./
FIO, (r = -0.3124, P >0.05), while a significant correlation was seen
between EVLWIc and PaO./FiO, (r= —0.528, P =0.009; Figure 1).
Conclusion Despite the small sample size, this study shows that in
patients undergoing pulmonary resection the EVLWIc is more strongly
correlated to PaO,/FiO, than EVLWI. Therefore, the EV1000 may be
a valuable tool for more reliable hemodynamic monitoring in this
subgroup of patients.

Introduction A goal-directed resuscitation therapy (GDT) through
optimization of cardiac output reduces complications in noncardiac
surgeries. We investigated whether the implementation of a GDT
protocol in high-risk cardiac surgery with the use of LiDCO Rapid
reduces postoperative complications as compared with the standard
of care.

Methods We performed a prospective and randomized study whereby
consecutive patients fulfilling one high-risk criteria (EuroSCORE >5,
ejection fraction <50%, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina

or extracardiac arteriopathy) were allocated to GDT or conventional
hemodynamic therapy. We excluded patients with endocarditis,
previous use of dobutamine, need for IABP, high dose of vasopressors
and emergency surgery. The GDT protocol involved hemodynamic
resuscitation aimed at a target of a cardiac index >3 I/minute/m?
through a three-step approach: fluid therapy of 250 ml lactated Ringer’s
solution, dobutamine infusion up to a dose of 20 ug/kg/minute, and
red blood cell transfusion to reach a hematocrit level above 28%.
Results Twenty patients from the GDT group were compared with 20
control patients. Both groups were comparable concerning baseline
characteristics and severity scores, except for a higher prevalence of
hypertension and heart failure in the GDT group. Intraoperative data
showed no difference regarding length of extracorporeal circulation,
fluid balance, transfusion or inotropic requirement. Patients from the
GDT group were given more fluids within the first 8 hours as compared
with the conventional group (1,250 ml vs. 500 ml, P <0.001). GDT
patients showed a median ICU stay of 3 days (95% Cl: 3 to 4) compared
with 5 days in control patients (95% Cl: 4 to 7). Moreover, hospital stay
was less prolonged in GDT patients (10 days vs. 14 days, P = 0.043).
Inotropic dependence was lower in the GDT group (29 hours vs.
55 hours, P= 0.003) as well as the cumulative dobutamine dosage (8 vs.
19 ug/kg/day, P = 0.025). Also, GDT group presented a lower incidence
of infections, tachyarrithmias and acute renal failure (RIFLE R) when
compared with the control group.

Conclusion A hemodynamic therapy tailored to an optimized cardiac
output reduced the length of ICU stay, vasoactive drug requirement
and postoperative complications.

Introduction Pulmonary complications are the primary reason for
extending a patient's stay in the ICU. The aim of this study was to
investigate whether perioperative volume management can influence
the PaO.,/FiO, value and total length of stay in the ICU.
Methods Sixteen patients were divided into two groups: one group
was treated with a restrictive approach (<8 ml/kg/hour), and the other
with a liberal approach (> 8 ml/kg/hour). Patients were randomly
allocated using sealed envelopes. During the thoracic part of the
surgical procedure, all patients received one-lung ventilation (OLV).
Results In the group treated with a restrictive volume approach,
patients received fluids at the rate of 7.0 + 1.0 ml/kg/hour. PaO,/FiO,
was 288 + 14 after intubation and 270 + 22 before extubation. In the
group treated with a liberal volume approach, fluids were replaced
at 11.0 + 2.0 ml/kg/hour. PaO,/FiO, was 259 + 24 after intubation and
223 + 43 before extubation. Surgery combined with OLV was found to
significantly affect the PaO,/FiO, value (ANOVA, F, |, = 15.85a, P= 0.001,
partial n? = 0.531). The average PaO./FiO, level was significantly higher
in the restrictive-replacement group than in the liberal-replacement
group (ANOVA, F, ,, = 9.66, P = 0.008, partial n* = 0.408). There was
no interaction between the groups (ANOVA, F,,, = 1.7a, P = 0.215,
partial n? =0.108). Mean length of stay in the ICU was similar between
the restrictive-replacement group (5.2 + 2.3 days) and the liberal-
replacement group (6.3 + 1.6 days) (ANOVA, F, ,, = 0.814a, P = 0.382,
partial n? = 0.055).
Conclusion Results from this small sample indicate that esophageal
carcinoma surgery by itself had a detrimental effect on the PaO,/FiO,
value, which restriction of perioperative volume did not significantly
affect. Volume restriction also did not affect length of stay in the ICU.

Treatment-related cardiac complications associated with
goal-directed therapy in high-risk surgical patients: a meta-analysis

Introduction We hypothesized that goal-directed therapy (GDT) is not
associated with an increased risk of cardiac complications in high-risk,
noncardiac surgical patients. Patients with limited cardiopulmonary
reserve are at risk of mortality and morbidity after major surgery [1].
Augmentation of the oxygen delivery index (DO,I) with a combination
of intravenous fluids and inotropes (GDT) has been shown to reduce
the postoperative mortality and morbidity in high-risk patients [2].
However, concerns regarding cardiac complications associated with
fluid challenges and inotropes used to augment cardiac output may
deter clinicians from instituting early GDT in the very patients who are
more likely to benefit.

Methods Systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL
databases for randomized controlled trials of GDT in high-risk surgical
patients. Studies including cardiac surgery, trauma, and pediatric
surgery were excluded to minimize heterogeneity. We reviewed the
rates of all cardiac complications, arrhythmias, acute myocardial
ischemia, and acute pulmonary edema. Meta-analyses were performed
and forest plots drawn using RevMan software. Data are presented as
odd ratios (ORs) (95% Cls), and P values.

Results We identified 23 randomized controlled trials including 2,219
patients, who reported cardiac complications. GDT was associated
with a reduction in total cardiovascular complications (OR = 0.55 (0.39
to 0.78), P = 0.0007), and with a significantly reduced incidence of
arrhythmias (OR = 0.59 (0.38 to 0.91), P = 0.02). GDT was not associated
with an increase in acute pulmonary edema (OR = 0.68 (0.42 to 1.10),
P=0.11) or acute myocardial ischemia (OR = 0.70 (0.38 to 1.27), P=0.23).
Subgroup analysis of overall cardiovascular complications revealed that
the benefit is most pronounced in patients receiving fluid and inotrope
therapy (OR = 0.55 (0.34 to 0.89), P = 0.01) to achieve a supranormal
oxygen delivery target (OR = 0.50 (0.32 to 0.79), P = 0.003), guided by
the use of minimally invasive cardiac outmonitoring (OR = 0.50 (0.33 to
0.77), P= 0.002).

Conclusion Perioperative, physiologically guided, GDT in high-risk
surgical patients is not associated and actually reduces postoperative
cardiovascular complications.

Estimation of potential cost-savings related to the implementation
of perioperative hemodynamic goal-directed therapy

T Simon, G Marx

RWTH University Hospital Aachen, Germany

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P196 (doi: 10.1186/cc12134)

Introduction Many studies have demonstrated the ability of peri-
operative hemodynamic goal-directed therapy (pGDT) to decrease
postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing medium-to-high-risk
surgery [1]. As a result, pGDT may be a cost-saving strategy. Our goal
was to provide an estimation of potential cost-savings based on recent
literature.

Methods The largest and most recent meta-analysis [1] on pGDT
was used to estimate what could be the reduction of postoperative
morbidity if pGDT was to be adopted. Costs related to the treatment
of patients developing at least one (1+) postoperative complication
were obtained from two recent US [2] and Swiss [3] publications.
Potential cost-savings related to the adoption of pGDT were calculated
according to the actual morbidity rate, assuming 0% pGDT use so far,
and 100% compliance rate after implementation.

Results The 2011 meta-analysis [1] of 29 RCTs (4,805 patients) showed
that pGDT is associated with a reduction in the rate of patients
developing 1+ postoperative complications with odd ratios ranging

Actual morbidity rate no pGDT (%) 10 20 30 40 50 60
Expected morbidity rate pGDT (%) 3.5 to 5.5 7 tol] 11 to 17 14 to 22 18 to 28 21 to 33
Expected cost reduction/US patient ($) 808 to 1,167 1,615 to 2,333 2,423 to 3,500 3,231 to 4,667 4,039 to 5,833 4,846 to 7,000
Expected cost reduction/CH patient (S) 1,550 to 2,239 3,100 to 4,478 4,478 to 6,545 6,200 to 8,956 7,578 to 11,023 9,300 to 13,434

between 0.35 and 0.55. Importantly, these odd ratios were not

related to the morbidity rates. In the US publication [2], extra costs for

treating patients with 1+ complication were $17,949. In the Swiss (CH)

publication [3], they were $34,446. See Table 1.

Conclusion Depending on the pre-implementation morbidity rate,

the degree of pGDT-induced morbidity reduction and the country,

cost-savings ranged between $808 and $13,434 per patient. This large

variability suggests that local/hospital estimations are desirable before

starting pGDT implementation. These tailored evaluations would also

allow more precise cost-saving estimations by taking into account the

actual and expected pGDT compliance rates.

Cardiac output estimation: Vigileo and Mostcare versus
echocardiography

S Romagnoli, D Quattrone, AR De Gaudio

Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy
Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P197 (doi: 10.1186/cc12135)

Introduction In the present study we analyzed the reliability for
cardiac output (CO) measurement of Vigileo (Edwards Lifescience,
Irvine, CA, USA) and MostCare (pressure recording analytical method;
Vygon-Vytech, Padova, Italy) in comparison with transthoracic Doppler
echocardiography (as the reference method) in patients undergoing
vascular surgery.

Methods Both Vigileo and MostCare were connected to the FloTrac
transducer (Edwards Lifescience) for CO calculation. The data from
Vigileo and MostCare were registered (COVIG and COMC respectively)

Table 1 (abstract P197)

Pearson r’ Bias LoA
COECHO vs. COVIG (11) 0.31 (CI 0.24 to 1.63) -049 -341 to 243
COECHO vs. COMC (T1) 0.71 (Cl.0.56 to 1.08) —0.055 —1.19 to 1.08
COECHO vs. COVIG (T2) 0.27 (CI 0.16 to 1.53) -049 —3.24 to 2.34

and compared with those calculated with the echocardiographic
standard formulation (stroke volume = cross-sectional areaxvelocity
time integral; COECHO = SVxheart rate). In every patient CO was
measured twice: at baseline (T1) and after volume loading (500 ml
lactate Ringer solution) (T2). Agreements between COVIG, COMC, and
COECHO were evaluated by means of simple linear regression (r*) and
Bland-Altman analysis.

Results Twenty patients were enrolled in the study. Values of r’, bias
and limit of agreement at T1 and T2 are summarized in Table 1. CO
values ranged from 3.9 and 8.6 I/minute (echo), from 3.4 to 9.9 (Vigileo)
and from 4 to 8.3 (MostCare); the Pearson’s and Bland-Altman methods
showed poor agreement between COECHO and COVIG, demonstrating
a tendency to overestimation (see Figure 1). The percentage of error (PE)
was 51.7% at T1 and 49.3% at T2. On the contrary, MostCare measures
showed good agreement with echocardiography (see Table 1) with a
PE of 22.4% atT1 and of 17% at T2.

Conclusion Vigileo did not prove to be a substitute to the reference
system; pre-loaded data, necessary for vascular impedance estimation,
may be one of the main limitations that made Vigileo measurements
less accurate than the MostCare ones. On the contrary, MostCare, an
uncalibrated totally independent system, was shown to properly
estimate the vascular impedance in these hemodynamically stable
patients. Further comparisons in unstable conditions are needed to
confirm our observations.

Brachial pulse waveform characteristics predict development of
organ failure in septic patients

S Kazune, | Jagmane

Hospital of Traumatology and Orthopaedics, Riga, Latvia

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P198 (doi: 10.1186/cc12136)

Introduction Pulse waveform characteristics (pulse wave transit
time and augmentation index) are measures of arterial stiffness.
Previous studies have found an association between severity of
acute inflammatory states and increased arterial stiffness but it is
not known whether non-invasive pulse waveform analysis could
predict development of multiple organ failure in septic patients. The
purpose of this study was to evaluate the photoplethysmographic
brachial artery pulse wave transit time and augmentation index and
their changes in response to induced forearm ischemia in septic ICU
patients and correlate these indices to the development of subsequent
end organ damage.
Methods A prospective observational study in patients with sepsis
within 24 hours of admission. Severity of sepsis was assessed with
APACHE II score (median 18.5) and SOFA score (median 7.5). Three-
minute signal recording was done concurrently from the brachial
artery at the elbow and the radial artery at the wrist with an originally
designed photoplethysmograph at rest and after 5 minutes of induced
forearm ischemia. Recordings were analyzed to obtain the pulse wave
transit time and augmentation index at rest and 60 seconds after
induced ischemia. The SOFA score was recalculated at 48 hours post
recording.
Results We studied 14 consecutive general ICU patients. There was
a negative linear relationship between the pulse wave transit time
(median 22.6 ms) at rest and increase in SOFA score in 48 hours
(P = 0.02, r= 0.96). The postischemic pulse wave transit time increased
in all patients (median 25.7 ms) but no association was found
between the proportion of increase and subsequent change in SOFA.
Correlation between rest (median 7.6) and postischemic (median 7.2)
augmentation index and 48-hour SOFA scores was not statistically
significant (r = 0.57, P= 0.46).
Conclusion This study indicates that in early sepsis pulse waveform
characteristics could predict the risk of developing end organ failure.
The pulse wave transit time is more robust than the augmentation
index and could be easier to use in patients with poor perfusion.
Vascular reactivity indices do not seem to have predictive value in this
context.

Computerized decision support system improves consistency of
haemodynamic assessment amongst ICU team members

AE Aneman, R Ranganatha

Liverpool Hospital, Liverpool, Australia

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P199 (doi: 10.1186/cc12137)

Introduction This study evaluated the potential of the NAVIGATOR
(Applied Physiology) haemodynamic monitor to improve consistency
of cardiovascular assessments amongst ICU members with different
levels of expertise and experience.

Methods Patients (n = 20) post cardiac surgery were monitored by
NAVIGATOR to display heart efficiency (Eh), mean systemic filling
pressure (Pms) and vascular resistance (SVR) against targets for
mean arterial pressure and cardiac output set by the clinical team.
Four categories of staff participated: nine consultants (C), eight
senior registrars (SR), nine registrars (R) and 11 nurses (N) (median
ICU experience 15, 7, 2 and 10 years, respectively) and were asked
to score Eh, Pms, and SVR ranging (discrete steps of one) from —5
(grossly subnormal) to 0 (normal) to 5 (grossly supranormal) first
without (BLIND) and then given (OPEN) access to the NAVIGATOR
display. Recommendations for therapeutic interventions were noted.

S75

Agreement (maximum two steps deviation for each assessment
between staff; number of patients), disagreement (median and
interquartile range of steps) and therapeutic agreement (intervention/s
to change Eh, Pms and SVR in similar direction/s, number of patients)
were recorded and analysed for statistical difference BLIND versus
OPEN (Fisher's exact test, Mann-Whitney test, P <0.05).

Results Eh was commonly overestimated, Pms commonly under-
estimated with no clear trend for SVR. Agreement amongst all
categories of staff increased and disagreement score decreased for
Eh, Pms and SVR (Table 1) comparing BLIND versus OPEN assessments.
Agreement for therapeutic interventions also increased significantly
from 4/20 (BLIND) to 18/20 patients (OPEN).

Table 1 (abstract P199)

BLIND OPEN
Eh 6/20, 2 (1 to 3) 17/20*, 1 (0 to 1)*
Pms 6/20, 2.5 (2 to 4) 17/20*, 2 (1 to 2)*
SVR 8/20, 2 (1 to 2) 16/20*, 1 (1 to 2)*

Patients (n/20) and score (median and IQR). *P <0.05.

Conclusion The assessment of heart function, intravascular filling
and resistance state in postoperative cardiac patients was made
significantly more consistent amongst different ICU staff members
using the NAVIGATOR haemodynamic monitor. Such enhanced
consistency could potentially make the haemodynamic management
more effective with improved clinical outcomes.

Introduction In clinical practice, blood volumes (BV) are typically
measured by thermodilution. Recently, contrast-enhanced ultrasound
(CEUS) has been proposed as an alternative minimally invasive
approach for BV assessment [1]. This method measures BV using a
single peripheral injection of a small bolus of ultrasound contrast
agent (UCA) detected by an ultrasound scanner. By measuring the
acoustic backscatter, two indicator dilution curves (IDCs) can be
derived from two different sites in the circulatory system. IDC analysis
permits deriving the mean transit time (MTT) the bolus takes to travel
between the injection site and two measurement sites. Assessment of
the BV between these sites is obtained by multiplying the difference
in MTT (AMTT) by the blood flow. In this study, we compare different
volumes in an in vitro set-up by CEUS with true set-up volumes and
thermodilution acquired volumes.

Methods The in vitro set-up consisted of a centrifugal pump, a network
of tubes with variable volumes, an electromagnetic flowmeter to
measure and adjust the generated flow, heating devices to maintain
constant temperature (37°C), two thermistors for thermodilution
measurement, an ultrasound transducer and a pressure stabilizer. A
small bolus of UCA diluted in cold saline (1 mg SonoVue?® in 20 ml saline
at 4°C) was injected into the system. The cold UCA passage through a
first and a second region of interest (ROI) was measured simultaneously
with the ultrasound transducer and the thermistors. The measurements
were performed at different flows and volumes. BVs were estimated
using the two different approaches, namely CEUS and thermodilution.
The IDCs were processed and fitted separately with a dedicated model
to estimate the AMTT of the cold UCA bolus between the two ROls and
the two thermistors. All the measurements were repeated three times.
Results A linear relation between BVs estimated by the two techniques
was observed with a correlation coefficient of 0.94. The bias of
CEUS with respect to the true volumes was -40.1 ml; the bias of
thermodilution was 84.3 ml. The most prominent differences between
the two techniques were observed in case of high volume and low flow,
possibly due to different transport kinetics between UCAs and heat.

----$$$$----$$$$----
Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2

Conclusion Given the good correlation between BVs estimated with
CEUS and thermodilution, CEUS is not inferior to thermodilution with
the advantage of being minimally invasive.

Successful introduction of cardiac index, fluid responsiveness and
oxygen delivery data into the primary survey at a central London

major trauma centre and impact on time to CT, fluid resuscitation
and disposal

S Helyar, | De Abreu, S Holloway, P Hopkins

King’s Health Partners AHSC, London, UK

Introduction The use of cardiac output monitoring has been shown to
be beneficial in the setting of perioperative medicine and critical illness
[1,2]. More recently, its application in the setting of major trauma has
been described [3]. Here, we describe our preliminary experience of
embedding bioreactance flow monitoring within the major trauma
primary survey of severely injured patients and the subsequent effect
on patient management.

Methods Institutional ethical approval was obtained. Intubated major
trauma patients were sequentially enrolled. Exclusions included major
thoracic burns and children. Bioreactance flow monitoring (NICOM;
Cheetah) was applied at the same time as ECG leads and the calibration
step performed during handover from the prehospital team. Time to
availability of oxygen delivery data was recorded and trauma team
members surveyed regarding for perceived benefits and concerns from
this monitoring. The influence of flow monitoring on fluid resuscitation,
time to CT and definitive disposal (to OR/ICU) was measured and
compared with a control population matched for injury severity score,
age and sex.

Results Cardiac index was available at mean 10.6 minutes (median
9 minutes; SD 3.9), fluid responsiveness at mean 35.9 minutes (median
35; SD 11.3) and oxygen delivery calculation at mean 25.3 minutes
(median 25; SD 7.7). Passive leg raise was not performed in 63% of
patients due to concerns about pelvic or brain injury. Volume of fluid
infused (mean 738 vs. 925 ml; P = 0.124), time to CT (mean 57.4 vs.
68.8 minutes; P = 0.08), and time to definitive disposal (mean 124.9 vs.
146.1 minute; P = 0.069) were all reduced in the flow monitored group,
although not significantly different when compared with a matched

S76

control group (Mann-Whitney U rank sum). Eighty-four percent of
trauma team members surveyed felt the flow monitoring data to be
useful, and only 11% felt it may impair clinical management.
Conclusion Cardiac index, fluid responsiveness and oxygen delivery
data can be obtained inform a primary survey. Rather than introducing
delays, the use of flow monitoring was associated with a trend towards
decreased time to imaging; less fluid use pre-damage control point
and reduced time to definitive disposal. Further research is required to
confirm benefits and mechanism.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P202 (doi: 10.1186/cc12140)

Introduction Pulse pressure variation (PPV) is a dynamic indicator
of fluid responsiveness, which is known to have a low sensibility and
specificity in patients ventilated in pressure support (PS) [1]. We aim
to investigate patient-ventilator asynchrony as a potential source of
hemodynamic interference in PS.

Methods We performed a prospective study including PS ventilated
patients who met inclusion criteria for fluid depletion [1]. Patients who
showed an asynchrony index (Al) exceeding 10% were included in the
asynchrony group (AG). The remaining patients were included in the
synchrony group (SG) [2]. Beat-to-beat hemodynamic variables were
recorded through PRAM (Mostcare; Vytech Health srl, Padova, Italy).
PPV cutoff of 13% was used to identify fluid responders/nonresponders.
A fluid challenge of 500 ml normal saline was given in 5 minutes.
An increase of 15% of cardiac index after 10 minutes indicated fluid
responsiveness.

Results So far, eights patients showed an Al >10% while 16 did not.
Overall sensitivity was 28.6% versus 50% in SG; overall specificity was
76.5% versus 91.7% in AG. Overall Cohen's k was 33.3% versus 61.2% in
AG (see Figure 1). However, because none of the responders in the AG
group was detected by PPV, statistical analysis was not feasible within
this subgroup.

Comparison of pulse pressure variation with radial arterial systolic,
diastolic and pulse transit time interval variation in pediatric
patients undergoing liver transplantation

Introduction In pediatric patients, dynamic preload indices to predict
fluid responsiveness have conflicting results in comparison with adults.
A recent study demonstrated that pulse pressure variation (PPV) >16%
has provided an accurate method for predicting fluid responsiveness
in pediatric congenital heart surgery. We aimed to compare PPV and
respiratory systolic, diastolic and pulse transit time interval variation
(STV, DTV and PTTV, respectively) as predictors of fluid responsiveness
during pediatric liver transplantation.

Methods A total of 61 datafrom 16 pediatric patients, median age 5.4 years
(range 0.1 to 9 years), were retrospectively evaluated from electrically
recorded radial arterial and central venous pressure (CVP) waveform. The
time from the onset of systolic upstroke to the dicrotic notch was defined
as the systolic time interval (STI), and the time from dicrotic notch to the
beginning of systolic upstroke was defined as the diastolic time interval
(DTI). The time from peak R wave on electrocardiography to the onset of
systolic upstroke was defined as the pulse transit time (PTT) interval. STV
was calculated by averaging of three consecutive respiratory cycles with
the following: (STI_ — STI.) / STI... The same method was used
for calculating DTV, PTTV and PPV. STV, DTV and PTTV were corrected
by cardiac period. Averaged CVP was used as a Static preload index. PPV
threshold =>16% was used to discriminate fluid responsiveness. Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Pearson's correlation analysis
were used for the comparison.

Results PPV showed correlations with STV, DTV and PTTV (r = 0.65,
0.57 and 0.60, respectively), but less with CVP (r = -0.30). Area under
ROC curves (AUC) of STV, DTV, PTTV and CVP were 0.834, 0.872, 0.832
and 0.613, respectively. Cutoff values of STV, DTV, PTTV and CVP were
7.7% (sensitivity/specificity, 0.80/0.83), 7.7% (sensitivity/specificity,
0.70/0.88), 8.7% (sensitivity/specificity 0.67/1.0) and 3.1% (sensitivity/
specificity 0.50/0.85), respectively.

Conclusion This study shows that STV, DTV and PTTV can be used as
a surrogate for PPV =>16%, suggesting that this novel method can be
used to predict hemodynamic response during pediatric surgery.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P204 (doi: 10.1186/cc12142)

Introduction The mini-fluid challenge is a widely used strategy to
manage fluid loading in the ICU and OR. Although it might be a rational
strategy, data on the mini-fluid challenge and its reliability are very
limited. We investigated the value of changes in pulse contour cardiac
output as a result of a mini-fluid challenge of 50 and 100 ml to predict
fluid loading responsiveness.

Methods We measured the effects after the administration of 50, 100
and 500 ml bolus colloid infusions on CO (Modelflow (COm) and LiDCO
(COli)), CVP and MAP in 21 patients on mechanical ventilation after
elective cardiothoracic surgery. From the data we analysed the smallest
volume that was predictive for the effects of 500 ml on cardiac output.
Results COli and COm increased after 50, 100 and 500 ml fluid loading.
Best results are observed for changes in COm after 100 ml fluid loading
(area under the ROC 0.86, 95% Cl between 0.65 and 1.00). A change in
Modelflow CO of at least 4.3% has a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity
of 100% after 100 ml fluid loading. Sensitivity is 60% and specificity
83% for a similar cutoff in CO measured with the LiDCO device after
100 ml fluid loading. In our patient population, MAP and COli did not
predict responsiveness with more accuracy than mathematical chance.
See Figure 1.

Conclusion Changes in pulse contour CO can be used in a mini-fluid
challenge to assess fluid responsiveness in our postcardiac surgery
patients.

St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P206 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12144)

Introduction Fluid responsiveness is defined based on an arbitrary
increase of cardiac output (CO) or stroke volume (SV) of 10 to 15%. We
hypothesise that the variation of heart efficiency (Eh) and the slope
(S) defined by the relative increase of CO over the relative increase of
mean filling pressure (Pmsa) can be used as alternative definitions of
fluid responsiveness.

Methods Patients admitted to the ICU were monitored with a calibrated
LiDCOplus (LiDCO, UK) and Navigator (Applied Physiology, Australia) to
estimate Pmsa and Eh (Pmsa - central venous pressure/Pmsa). A 250 ml
fluid challenge was performed over 5 minutes. Categorical data were
compared by Pearson chi-square test. Correlation was assessed by
Kappa test. The inflexion point of S to define responders was obtained
by ROC curve analysis.

Results A total of 104 fluid challenges were observed in 40 patients. ROC
curve analysis reveals an area under the curve of 0.93 (95% Cl = 0.85
to 1, P <0.001). The best cutoff for the slope was 0.76 (sensitivity 0.92,
specificity 0.93). The proportions of responders identified by the AEh
(Table 1) and by the slope method (Table 2) are smaller compared with
the relative increase of SV method. Significant correlation was found
between both methods and the ASV (AEh k = 0.54, P <0.001; S k = 0.55,
P <0.001). See Figure 1.

Conclusion Moderate agreement is observed between new and
current definitions of fluid responsiveness.

Prediction of stroke volume response to fluid bolus in 100 children
R Saxena, A Durward, | Murdoch, S Tibby

Guy's & St Thomas’ NHS Trust, London, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P207 (doi: 10.1186/cc12145)

Introduction Fluid overload is associated with poor outcome in the
critically ill. Thus, an accurate predictor of a positive haemodynamic
response (increase in stroke volume) to fluid challenge is vital.
Methods We studied the predictive value (positive response defined
as change in stroke volume >15% after 10 ml/kg fluid bolus) of a range
of haemodynamic variables: static (CVP, active circulating volume,
central blood volume, total end diastolic volume), dynamic (systolic
pressure variation, stroke volume variation) and contactility (dp/dt),
in a group of 100 ventilated children (median weight 10 kg). Variables
were measured using transpulmonary ultrasound dilution and PRAM
(an arterial pulse contour method).

Results We performed 168 paired measurements (pre-fluid and post-
fluid challenge), with a SV response rate of 45%. Overall predictive
values were poor, but slightly better for static versus dynamic variables
(Table 1). When SV response was analysed as a continuous variable,
the two predictive multivariable variables were change in TEDVI and
baseline dp/dt (r? = 0.30, both P <0.001).

Table 1 (abstract P207). ROC areas for haemodynamic variables

AUC 95% Cl
CVP 0.50 0.41 0.59
ACVI 0.62 0.54 0.71
CBVI 0.59 0.50 0.68
TEDVI 0.65 0.56 0.73
SPV 0.59 0.50 0.69
SVV 048 0.39 0.58
dp/dt 0.59 0.50 0.68

Conclusion The predictive ability for typical static and dynamic
haemodynamic variables, when taken in isolation, is poor. However,
improved prediction is seen when baseline contractility is taken into
account.

pressure (MAP)-guided fluid therapy on microcirculatory perfusion in
patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

Methods Patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery were
randomized into a PPV/Cl-guided group (n = 11) or a MAP-guided
(n = 12) group. PPV, Cl and MAP were measured using the non-invasive
finger arterial blood pressure measurement device ccNexfin (Edwards
Lifesciences BMEYE, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Tidal volumes were
>8 ml/kg with PEEP =8 mmHg. In both groups, MAP of 70 mmHg
was maintained. In the PPV/CI group, an intraoperative algorithm
was used keeping the PPV under 12% and Cl above 2.5 |/minute/
m? using fluid therapy and dobutamine and noradrenaline infusion,
respectively. Sublingual microvascular perfusion was measured after
anesthesia induction, and every subsequent hour using sidestream
dark-field imaging (Microscan; Microvision Medical, Amsterdam, the
Netherlands). The perfused small vessel density (PVD) values were
offline quantified.

Results The first hour during surgery, the PPV/Cl-guided group tended
to receive more fluids than the MAP-guided group (1,014 + 501ml vs.
629 + 463 ml; P= 0.07). At this time point, the PVD was slightly lower in
the PPV/Cl-guided group (16.7 + 3.1 mm/mm/?) when compared with
the MAP-guided group (17.9 + 3.9 mm/mm/’; P = 0.41). In both groups
the PVD remained stable during the first 2 hours of surgery. However,
2 hours after the start of surgery, the PVD in the PPV/CI group restored
and tended to be higher than in the MAP-guided group (21.1 + 1.9 vs.
18.1 + 3.4 mm/mm7; P= 0.09). After 1 hour of surgery, the administered
fluid volume correlated inversely with PVD (r= -0.59, P= 0.011).
Conclusion Goal-directed fluid management resulted in a higher
administered fluid volume in the beginning of surgery, and this was
associated with a slightly reduced microcirculatory perfusion when
compared with MAP-guided fluid management. Microcirculatory
perfusion tended to improve as surgery progressed in the goal-directed
fluid therapy group. Our findings suggest that goal-directed and MAP-
guided fluid management are associated with distinct patterns in
fluid resuscitation, which may be of consequence for microvascular
perfusion.

‘Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada; ?Charles University, Medical Faculty in
Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P209 (doi: 10.1186/cc12147)

Introduction Sidestream dark-field (SDF) imaging was introduced
recently to study the sublingual microcirculation in humans. Patients
with ileostomies offer a unique access to the intestinal microcirculation.
To date, no reference ranges for standard microcirculatory parameters
of the gut are available. Therefore, the aim of our study was to
establish a database for postoperative microcirculatory parameters for
ileostomies.

Methods For this observational prospective cohort study 77 patients
were screened. In total, 165 SDF measurements could be obtained. All
patients included had bowel surgery for chronic inflammatory bowel
disease or intestinal malignancies and received an ileostomy. Patients
were excluded if they had signs of local infection or bleeding, or if they
were admitted to the ICU for sepsis or perioperative complications. The
SDF device was gently inserted into the stoma at a depth of 3 to 4cm, and
five real-time images were recorded. All videos recorded were analyzed
offline using AVA®° software (Microvision Medical, Amsterdam, the
Netherlands). The following parameters were quantified: microvascular
flow index (MFI), total vessel density (TVD), perfused vessel density
(PVD), and proportion of perfused vessels (PPV). Patients were followed
for 3 days post surgery with five images captured every day.

Results We were able to capture clear images of the small intestine
microvasculature. Distinct villi were visible with a dense network
of microvessels (diameter: 6 to 17 um). Mean TVD (+ 2SD) was 19.3
(+ 1.0) mm/mm7?, PVD: 18.5 (+ 1.1) mm/mm7?, PPV: 94.5 (+ 5)% and
MFI: 2.8 (+ 0.1). Patients’ age, sex and comorbidity had no significant
impact on postoperative microvascular parameters. No significant
changes of the microvascular parameters were observed during the
first 3 postoperative days.

S79

Conclusion SDF imaging is a feasible, non-invasive bedside method
to study the postoperative intestinal microcirculation. The established
reference ranges are useful for early detection of postoperative local
complications and studies of microcirculatory changes induced by
systemic pathologies; for example, in sepsis.

University of Szeged, Hungary

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P210 (doi: 10.1186/cc12148)

Introduction Tissue capnometry has been used to assess organ
perfusion but it is not generally available at the bedside [1,2]. Our aim
was to test a new sublingual capillary tonometer in haemorrhagic
shock.

Methods Thirty-six mini-pigs were anaesthetised, ventilated and divided
into sham operated and shock groups. Instrumentation included:
intestinal and sublingual tonometry, haemodynamic monitoring
(PiCCO; Pulsion, Germany) and orthogonal polarization spectroscopy
(OPS). After baseline measurements (TO) haemorrhagic shock was
induced and maintained by reducing mean arterial pressure (MAP)
to ~40 mmHg for 60 minutes. Measurements were repeated every
30 minutes (T1 to T6). Fluid resuscitation started after T2 aiming to
increase MAP to 75% of the baseline value. OPS imaging was performed
at TO, T2 and T6. Data are presented as the median (interquartile
range), for statistical analysis Friedmann ANOVA, Mann-Whitney and
Spearman tests were used as appropriate.

Results Bleeding resulted in a significant decrease in MAP and cardiac
index, and an increase in heart rate. Macrohaemodynamic changes
were accompanied by significant changes in red blood cell velocity
(RBCV) and a significant increase in the intestinal and sublingual
mucosal-to-arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure difference (PCO,
gap): from 4 (2 to 11) to 30 (23 to 37) mmHg in the sublingual, and from
25 (17 to 31) to 50 (33 to 64) mmHg in the ileum. RBCV decreased from
1,075 (945 to 1,139) to 520 (449 to 621) um/second in the sublingual
area, and from 646 (596 to 712) to 419 (350 to 451) um/second in the
ileum. There was significant correlation between RBCV and PCO, gap in
sublingual and intestinal regions alike: r= -0.58; r = -0.71, P <0.0001,
respectively.

Conclusion In this model of haemorrhagic shock, sublingual PCO,
gap showed good correlation with RBCV, suggesting that this new
sublingual capillary tonometer may be an appropriate tool for
monitoring microcirculation at the bedside.

Sublingual microcirculatory changes during transient
intra-abdominal hypertension: a study in laparoscopic surgery
patients

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P211 (doi: 10.1186/cc12149)

Introduction Microvascular alterations play an important role in
development of organ failure [1]. It is not known whether increased
intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is associated with microcirculatory
perfusion derangements. Our hypothesis was that transiently
increased IAP is related to microcirculatory alterations in laparoscopic
cholecystectomy patients.

Methods Sixteen patients (14 female, two male) who underwent
laparoscopic cholecystectomy were studied. Sublingual orthogonal
polarization spectral (OPS) imaging was used to detect microcirculatory
function. OPS was done before surgery, at least 15 minutes after
initiation of pneumoperitoneum and 1 hour after the end of pneumo-
peritoneum. The microcirculation cutoff value for vessels was 20 um.
Data are presented as medians with interquartile ranges.

Results Patient median age was 54 (39 to 63) years, ASA score 2 (2 to 3),
BMI 29.7 (24.9 to 34.7), haemoglobin concentration 138 (133 to 142) g/l,
and hematocrit 42 (39 to 43). IAP was held at 12.5 (12 to 13) mmHg,
median duration of pneumoperitoneum was 45 (24 to 55) minutes.
Median MAP was 86 (69 to 93), abdominal perfusion pressure (APP)
73 (57 to 81) mmHg during the pneumoperitoneum. Median fluid
administration during anesthesia was 1,050 (1,000 to 1,400) ml.
Altogether 448 microcirculation videos were taken. Interobserver
variability was 24%. The following microcirculatory parameter values
describe before, during and after pneumoperitoneum periods. Total
vascular density was 19.4 (17.0 to 21.1); 18.5 (17.0 to 20.9); 19.3 (16.9 to
20.9) n/mm~?. Perfused vessels density was 13.3 (10.9 to 15.2); 13.8 (8.9
to 18.0); 13.1 (11.0 to 16.0) n/mm2. Proportion of perfused vessels (PPV)
was 61 (50 to 69); 64 (45 to 76); 60 (54 to 67)%. Microvascular flow index
was 2.4 (2.0 to 2.5); 2.5 (2.0 to 3.0); 2.3 (2.0 to 2.9) and heterogeneity
index was 0.8 (0 to 0.9); 0.6 (0 to 1.0); 0.6 (0 to 0.8). No significant
differences in microcirculatory parameters were observed between
time points. PPV was somewhat less than that of described in healthy
volunteers (61% vs. 90%) [2].

Conclusion Microcirculatory alterations are mild during transient
increase of intra-abdominal pressure in laparoscopic surgery patients.

Changes in microcirculatory perfusion during cardiac surgery are
paralleled by alterations in glycocalyx integrity

University, Maastricht, the Netherlands

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P212 (doi: 10.1186/cc12150)

Introduction Previous studies demonstrate that loss of glycocalyx
integrity is associated with impaired microvascular function. We
investigated whether glycocalyx dimensions are reduced in patients
undergoing cardiac surgery with or without cardiopulmonary bypass
(CPB), and are paralleled by loss of microcirculatory perfusion using in
vivo microcirculation measurements.

Methods Patients undergoing on-pump surgery with nonpulsatile
(n= 11) or pulsatile (n = 13) CPB or off-pump surgery (n = 13) underwent
sublingual sidestream dark-field imaging at baseline, during coronary
grafting and upon ICU admission to assess perfused microvascular
vessel density. Glycocalyx integrity was evaluated using the GlycoCheck
Measurement Software, and expressed as the perfused boundary
region (PBR). An increase in PBR represents deeper penetration of
erythrocytes into the glycocalyx, and is indicative for compromised
glycocalyx thickness.

Results The perfused vessel density remained stable during off-
pump surgery, while the PBR decreased from 2.6 + 0.1 um (baseline)
to 2.3 + 0.1 um (ICU). Nonpulsatile CPB was associated with loss
of microcirculatory perfusion during bypass (15.1 + 2.7 mm/mm7’)
and ICU admission (15.3 + 2.6 mm/mm/?) compared with baseline
(19.8 + 2.8 mm/mm?’). Pulsatile CPB reduced the perfused vessel
density from 20.9 + 2.4 to 16.7 + 2.6 mm/mm*, but this was restored
towards baseline levels upon ICU admission (20.3 + 2.3 mm/mm/’;
P = 0.02 between groups). The PBR increased upon initiation of CPB
in both groups, but remained elevated in the nonpulsatile flow group
only. In the pulsatile group, the PBR started at 2.4 + 0.1 um, increased
to 2.7 + 0.1 um during bypass but restored already during CPB towards
a PBR value of 2.3 + 0.1 um (ICU). The PBR and perfused vessel density
showed a good correlation (r = -0.65; P = 0.002), demonstrating loss of
perfused vascular density when the glycocalyx is damaged.
Conclusion The glycocalyx is damaged after initiation of CPB, and
restoration is impaired after exposure to nonpulsatile flow during the
use of the heart-lung machine. A reduction in glycocalyx thickness,
represented by an increased PBR, correlates with impairment of
perfused microvascular vessel density. Our data support the use
of intraoperative PBR monitoring as a novel clinical indicator of
microcirculatory perfusion.

Introduction Cold exposure can be adapted for exercise or therapeutic
purposes, but its impact on microcirculation in healthy humans has not
been well defined. We hypothesize that whole body cold stress may
impair microcirculation.

Methods Seven volunteers were recruited for the water immersion
procedure. During the cooling protocol the volunteers every
20 minutes of immersion were asked to step out from the bath and
rest for 10 minutes in a room environment and then return to the
water bath for the next 20 minutes of immersion. This head-out
immersion procedure in bath water at 14°C continued until the rectal
temperature was dropped to 35.5°C or the time of 180 minutes was
terminated. Maximum cold water immersion time was 120 minutes.
Before, at the end of whole body cooling and 1 hour after cooling was
ended, systemic hemodynamics and direct in vivo observation of the
sublingual microcirculation were obtained with sidestream dark-field
imaging. Assessment of microcirculatory parameters of convective
oxygen transport (microvascular flow index (MFI), proportion of
perfused vessels (PPV)), and diffusion distance (perfused vessel density
(PVD) and total vessel density (TVD)) was done using a semiquantitative
method.

Results During cooling and 1 hour after cooling was ended, a significant
increase in cardiac output (P = 0.028 and P = 0.043) was observed,
but there were no changes in heart rate or mean arterial pressure in
comparison with baseline variables. There were no significant changes
in PPV, MFI, PVD and TVD of small vessels in comparison with baseline
variables during all observational time.

Conclusion Defined cold exposure had no effect on the micro-
circulation.

Introduction Vasodilation and increased skin blood flow (also
sweating) are influential in heat dissipation during heat exposure and
exercise. It is unclear how heat stress influences microcirculation. Side
dark-field imaging visualizes the blood flow at the capillary level and
helps to assess perfusion heterogeneity. Clinical and experimental
data show that the sublingual region is clinically relevant for
detecting microcirculatory alterations and more represents central
microcirculation than cutaneous perfusion. We hypothesize that whole
body heat stress may increase capillary density.

Methods Eight healthy men with no history of cold and/or heat injury
were recruited to this study. Passive body heating was performed by
continuous immersion up to the waist in the water bath at 44°C and
continued until rectal temperature reached 39.5°C. Before, at the end
of whole body heating and 1 hour after heating was ended, systemic
hemodynamics and direct in vivo observation of the sublingual
microcirculation were obtained with sidestream dark-field imaging.
Assessment of microcirculatory parameters of convective oxygen
transport (microvascular flow index (MFI), proportion of perfused
vessels (PPV)), and diffusion distance (perfused vessel density (PVD)
and total vessel density (TVD)) was done using a semiquantitative
method. Vessels were separated into large (mostly venules) and small
(mostly capillaries) using a diameter cutoff value of 20 um.

Results Whole body heating resulted in significantly increased heart
rate (P = 0.012) and cardiac output (P = 0.046) in comparison with
baseline variables. One hour after heating was ended, the heart rate

remained increased (P = 0.012), but cardiac output returned to baseline
values. During all observational time the mean arterial pressure remain
unaltered. There was no significant difference in MFI and PPV of small
vessels at the end of heating and 1 hour after heating in comparison
with baseline variables. One hour after heating we observed significant
increase in PVD (P = 0.046) and TVD (P = 0.028) of small vessels
regardless of lack of difference at the end of heating (P = 0.753 and
P=0.075, respectively) in comparison with baseline variables.
Conclusion Whole body heating induced time-dependent changes in
capillary density.

Observational study of the effects of age, diabetes mellitus,
cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease on sublingual microvascular
flow

Introduction Sidestream dark-field (SDF) imaging is an important
new technology that has been used to demonstrate microcirculatory
abnormalities in a variety of critical illnesses [1]. The microcirculation
is also affected by age and chronic comorbidities. However, the effect
of these conditions on SDF microcirculatory parameters has not been
well described.
Methods Sublingual SDF images were obtained from five groups of
20 participants: healthy volunteers under 25 years, healthy volunteers
over 55 years, and stable patients over 55 years with one of diabetes
mellitus (DM), cirrhosis and stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Microcirculatory parameters [1] between the groups were then com-
pared for significance using ANOVA for parametric data and the
Kruskal-Wallis test for nonparametric data. This was approved by the
local ethics committee.
Results All DM patients were type 2, with mean glycated haemoglobin
(HbA1c) of 8.8% (SD 1.7%). Seventeen cirrhotic patients were Child-
Pugh-Turcotte score A and one was score B. For CKD, the mean
estimated glomerular filtration rate was 11.5 ml/minute (SD 2.9).
Median microvascular flow index (MFI) was 2.85 (IQR 2.75 to 3.0) for
participants aged <25, 2.81 (2.66 to 2.97) for those aged >55, 2.88 (2.75
to 3.0) for those with DM, 3.0 (2.83 to 3.0) for those with cirrhosis and
3.0 (2.78 to 3.0) for those with CKD (P for difference = 0.14). There were
no significant differences in the proportion of perfused vessels and
perfused vessel density between the groups. See Figure 1.
Conclusion Older age, diabetes, and chronic kidney and liver disease
need not be considered confounding factors for comparison of SDF
microcirculatory parameters in the critically ill.

Introduction Serial measurements of lactate over time may be a better
prognosticator than a single lactate concentration [1]. Early lactate-
guided therapy also reduces ICU length of stay and ICU and hospital
mortality [2]. This study aims to assess the prognostic value of the
lactate clearance (LC) in the first 24 hours in surgical patients.
Methods In a prospective cohort during 1 year, we followed consecu-
tively enrolled patients admitted immediately postoperative to the
surgical ICU of Hospital Santa Luzia, Brasilia, Brazil. Patients were
assigned to two groups: LC >10% and LC <10%. The primary outcome
measure was mortality at 7 and 28 days. The secondary outcome
included hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS).

Results A total of 417 patients were followed. In total, 50.4% were
male and 83% underwent elective surgery. The mean age was 59 + 16,
APACHE II score 8 + 5, SAPS 2 26 + 11. The mortality at 7 days was 0.95%
(n = 4) and the mortality at 28 days was 2.15% (n = 9), respectively.
Hospital mortality was 4.79% (n = 20). Sixty-one percent (n = 255) of
the patients had LC >10% versus 39% (n = 162) with LC <10%. Those
who had LC <10% were older (62 + 16 vs. 57 + 17, P= 0.00) and had
greater APACHE II score (9 + 6 vs. 7 + 4, P= 0.00) and SAPS 2 (28 + 12
vs. 25 + 10, P = 0.02). There was no difference in ICU LOS (5 + 12 vs.
4 +9 days, P=0.54) and hospital LOS (10 + 15 vs.9 + 11 days, P= 0.48).
Initial lactate levels were lower in the group with LC <10% (1.1 + 0.9
vs. 1.9 + 1.6, P = 0.00); however, mean lactate was higher in 24 hours
(2.0 + 1.8 vs. 1.0 + 0.7, P = 0.00). All of the patients who died in the
first 7 days had LC <10% (2.46%, n= 4, P = 0.02); this group also had a
higher mortality at 28 days (4.32%, n = 7 vs. 0.78%, n = 2; P= 0.03). The
relative risk for mortality LC <10% in 7 and 28 days was 1.02 (95% Cl:
1.00 to 1.05) and 5.07 (95% Cl: 1.17 to 27.09), respectively. Significant
difference was observed in the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for 7 and
28 days (P= 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). The sensibility of LC <10% was
100% (95% Cl: 51 to 100%) for 7-day mortality and 78% (95% Cl: 45 to
94%) for 28-day mortality. The specificity was 62% (95% Cl: 57 to 66%)
for 7-day mortality and 62% (95% Cl: 57 to 66%) for 28-day mortality.
Conclusion Despite initial lactate levels, lactate clearance <10% proved
to be a good predictor of mortality in 7 and 28 days in surgical patients
admitted in the postoperative period to the ICU.

Introduction The use of peripheral perfusion objective parameters to
anticipate successful resuscitation in septic shock has been recently
investigated [1]. The mottling score, a perfusion parameter used for
decades, has been proposed to correlate with septic shock survival [2],
and was tested in this study as a clinical tool in predicting mortality.

Methods A prospective observational study was conducted, with
patients consecutively admitted to a tertiary hospital ICU in Brasilia,
Brazil. From July 2011 to May 2012, all patients diagnosed with septic
shock were enrolled. Demographic data, diagnoses, shock origin and
severity scores were recorded. After initial resuscitation, the score
was registered in the first 3 days by the same observer, considering
the score on the lower limb without an arterial catheter, or the worst
between the lower limbs, and the worst in the 3 days. Exclusion criteria
were terminal illness with no intervention decision and incomplete

data. The scores are pooled in Group 1 (scores 0 and 1), Group 2 (scores
2 and 3) and Group 3 (scores 4 and 5) to compare mortality. Statistical
analysis was made using the chi-square test.
Results One hundred and seventeen patients were analyzed; 20 were
excluded (18 terminal illness, two with incomplete data). Ninety-seven
patients were included; the mean age was 72.8 years, mean SAPS II
score was 46.8 (SD + 15.7), mean APACHE II score was 19.2 (SD + 8.1);
mean norepinephrine dose was 1.25 yug/kg/minute; mean length of
stay in ICU was 19.2 days (1 to 176); mottling score distribution was:
score 0: 41 patients; score 1: 33 patients; score 2: 14 patients; score 3:
two patients; score 4: three patients; score 5: four patients. The sepsis
origin was as follows: 65, pulmonary (67%); 18, abdominal (18.5%);
nine, urinary (9.5%); two, osseous (2%); one, mediastinal; one, skin and
soft tissue; and one, central nervous system (1% each). Comparing
the mortality in Groups 1, 2 and 3, we found a significant difference
(P =0.042), even greater when considering 28-day mortality (P = 0.004).
The Kaplan-Meier survival method showed P = 0.000.
Conclusion The mottling score was an objective reproducible system
to bedside use and a good predictor of septic shock mortality.

Introduction This study aimed to compare the cerebral effects of
terlipressin (TERLI) with conventional prehospital fluid resuscitation
with lactated Ringer's solution (LR) in a model of haemorrhagic shock
(HS).

Methods Pigs (20 to 30 kg) were randomized into one of the groups:
Sham (n = 2), HS (n = 9), LR (3x volume bled; n = 9) or TERLI (2 mg bolus;
n = 9). HS induced to target MAP of 40 mmHg was maintained for
30 minutes. Brain tissue oxygen pressure (PbtO.), intracranial pressure
(ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), haemodynamics and blood gas
analyses were assessed prior to HS (baseline) up to 120 minutes after
treatment. Tissue markers of brain oedema (aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and
Na-K-Cl cotransporter-1 (NKCC1)), apoptosis (pre-apoptotic protein
(Bax)) and oxidative stress (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances
(TBARS)) were also measured.

Results Sham animals had no significant changes in the variables
assessed. HS resulted in a significant decrease in CPP (mean varied
from 36 to 39 mmHg), PbtO, (from 23.6 to 26.6 mmHg), ICP (from 1
to 2 mmHg) and haemodynamics (MAP from 38 to 40 mmHg; Cl from
1.8 to 2.1 I/minute/m?), and a significant increase in blood lactate (from
6.7 to 8.9 mmol/l) and cerebral AQP4 (mean + SE; 167 + 54% of sham),
NKCC1 (237 + 47% of sham), Bax (167 + 44% of sham) and TBARS. Fluid
resuscitation was followed by an increase in ICP (from 7 to 9 mmHg) and
a decrease in CPP (from 41 to 52 mmHg), with an increased expression
of cerebral AQP4 (210 + 56% of sham), NKCC1 (163 + 32% of sham) and
Bax (137 + 24% of sham). Only TERLI restored baseline values of CPP
(from 54 to 61 mmHg) and did not change the cerebral expression of
AQP4 (100 + 6% of sham), NKCC1 (100 + 1% of sham), Bax (102 + 6% of
sham) and TBARS. Both TERLI and LR recovered baseline levels of PbtO,
(TERLI from 30.0 to 34.2 mmHg; LR from 29.4 to 40.7 mmHg) and MAP
(TERLI from 53 to 64 mmHg; LR: 48 to 61 mmHg). Blood lactate levels
were not recovered in any group (TERLI from 5.7 to 8.1 mmol/l; LR from
4.5 to 7.7 mmol/l).

Conclusion TERLI recovered cerebral perfusion and oxygenation
with no significant changes in ICP and cerebral markers of oedema,
apoptosis and oxidative stress. LR did not recover CPP probably due to
a significant increase in ICP caused by brain oedema, which may have

$82

contributed to the cerebral apoptosis. None of the treatments caused
cerebral oxidative stress.

Accuracy of the shock index and various modified shock indexes to
predict early mortality in patients suffering from gastrointestinal
haemorrhage

Hopital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, Canada

Introduction The shock index (SI) is an easy-to-use clinical tool that
rapidly identifies patients at risk of haemodynamic decompensation.
Previous studies focused primarily on patients suffering from
pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, ruptured ectopic pregnancy and
traumatic haemorrhagic shock. Modified Sls have also been studied.
Could the SI be accurate in patients suffering from gastrointestinal (Gl)
haemorrhage? The aim of this study was to compare the performance
of the SI with various modified Sls and conventional vital signs in
predicting 30-day mortality in a population of patients with a Gl
haemorrhage.

Methods A single-center post-hoc analysis was conducted of
prospectively collected data from patients diagnosed with a Gl
haemorrhage episode in an academic emergency department (ED)
from March 2008 to December 2011. Data were extracted from two
databases used at our ED. The SI (pulse/systolic blood pressure) and
nine modified Sls were calculated from the available first documented
vital signs. ROC curves were used to determine sensitivity and
specificity of the different Sls in predicting 30-day mortality.

Results Of the 770 patients included in the analysis, 52 died within
30 days. The standard SI at a cutoff point of 0.7 had the highest
predictability and sensitivity of 30-day mortality (area under the curve
(AUC) = 0.7, sensitivity = 0.79, specificity = 0.56). In comparison, one
of the modified Sls (pulse/diastolic blood pressure) had 0.65 sensitivity
and 0.71 specificity (AUC = 0.73). A heart rate >100 bpm predicted 30-
day mortality with 0.40 sensitivity and 0.82 specificity (AUC = 0.63).
Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine
the relationship between the SI and mortality in patients with a
GI haemorrhage. It appears that the standard SI, when compared
with various modified Sls and conventional vital signs, had the
highest combined predictability and sensitivity of 30-day mortality
in a population of patients suffering from GI haemorrhage. Further
prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Introduction Shock induces mitochondrial damage, which can lead
to tissue injury and inflammation. Resuscitative adjuncts to limit
mitochondrial injury may be effective to reduce tissue injury and
protect against the sequelae of hemorrhagic shock (HS). Others and we
have demonstrated the protective effects of inhaled carbon monoxide
(CO) or nebulized sodium nitrite (NaNO.) in models of HS. Our aim was
to test the hypothesis that CO and NaNO, protect against hemorrhagic
shock-induced tissue injury/inflammation by limiting mitochondrial
damage and preventing bioenergetic failure.

Methods Twenty anesthetized female Yorkshire pigs were subjected
to severe hemorrhage until unable to compensate or 90 minutes, and
were then resuscitated with volume/pressors. Muscle and platelet
samples were obtained at baseline (BL) and 2 hours after resuscitation
(EndObs). Animals were randomized to: standard of care (HSR, n = 5);
HSR+CO (CO; 250 ppmx30 minutes, n = 6); or HSR+NaNO, (NaNO,,

11 mg in PBSx30 minutes, n = 6), and sham (n = 3). CO or NaNO, were
initiated ~30 minutes before resuscitation. Primary endpoints were
changes in muscle and platelet mitochondrial respiration between
BL and EndObs, quantified by muscle respiratory control ratio (RCR,
traditional respirometry), and by the change in proton-leak respiration
(PLR) and mitochondrial reserve capacity in platelets. Secondary
endpoint was mortality at EndObs.

Results Skeletal muscle RCR decreased in the HSR group (P = 0.04) but
not in sham. Decrease in RCR was primarily due to decreased ADP-
dependent respiration, without change in state 4 respiration. HSR
also resulted in platelet mitochondrial dysfunction as demonstrated
by increased PLR and decreased reserve capacity. This correlated
with increased platelet activation (%CD62P+ by flow cytometry) in
HSR. CO or NaNO, treatment prevented these deleterious changes in
both muscle and platelet mitochondrial respiration, as well as limited
HSR-induced platelet activation. CO treatment also improved reserve
capacity compared with baseline. Mortality was higher in HSR than in
CO or NaNO, (80 vs. 33 and 33%, respectively).

Conclusion In severe HS, mitochondrial injury in platelets and muscle
was limited by CO or NaNO.. Although not powered for a secondary
endpoint, mortality was double in HSR versus adjunctive therapies.
This suggests that CO and NaNO, may protect mitochondrial function
by maintaining ATP-coupled respiration and reserve capacity, and that
this may confer a survival advantage. However, further investigations
are required.

Introduction Norepinephrine has been widely used in_ septic
shock. However, its effect remains controversial. We conduct a
systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effect between
norepinephrine and other vasopressors.

Methods The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases
from database inception until October 2012 were searched. We
selected randomized controlled trials in adults with septic shock and
compared norepinephrine with other vasopressors. The quality of
each study included was assessed with Jadad score. After assessing for
heterogeneity of treatment effect across trials using the I? statistic, we
used a fixed effect model (P =0.1) or random-effects model (P <0.1) and
expressed results as the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or the
standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous data with 95% Cl.
Results Eighteen trials (n = 2,715) met inclusion criteria, which
compared norepinephrine with five different vasopressors (dopamine,
vasopressin, epinephrine, terlipressin and phenylephrine). The mean
Jadad score was 3.11. Overall, there was no difference in mortality
in the comparisons between norepinephrine and vasopressin,
epinephrine, terlipressin and phenylephrine (P >0.05, respectively).
However, norepinephrine had a trend in decreasing mortality
compared with dopamine (RR, 0.84; 95% Cl, 0.68 to 1.02; P= 0.08). There
were a decreased heart rate (HR) (SMD, -2.10; 95% Cl, -3.95 to -0.25;
P = 0.03), cardiac index (SMD, -0.73; 95% Cl, -1.14 to -0.03; P = 0.004)
and an increased systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) (SMD, 1.03;
95% Cl, 0.61 to 1.45; P <0.0001) with the treatment of norepinephrine
compared with dopamine.

Conclusion There is not sufficient evidence to prove that
norepinephrine is superior to vasopressin, epinephrine, terlipressin
and phenylephrine in terms of mortality. However, norepinephrine is
associated with a decreased HR, cardiac index and an increased SVRI,
and appears to have a greater effect on decreasing mortality compared
with dopamine.

Introduction Vasoplegic syndrome is a common complication after
cardiac surgery, with negative impact on patient outcomes and
hospital costs. Pathogenesis of vasodilatory phenomenon after cardiac
surgery remains a matter of controversy. Loss of vascular tone can
be partly explained by the depletion of neurohypophyseal arginine
vasopressin stores. Vasopressin is commonly used as an adjunct to
catecholamines to support blood pressure in refractory septic shock,
but its effect on vasoplegic shock is unknown. We hypothesized that
the use of vasopressin would be more effective on treatment of shock
after cardiac surgery than norepinephrine, decreasing the composite
endpoint of mortality and severe morbidity.

Methods In this prospective and randomized, double-blind trial,
we assigned patients who had vasoplegic shock to receive either
vasopressin (0.01 to 0.06 U/minute) or norepinephrine (0.01 to 1 ug/
kg/minute) in addition to open-label vasopressors. All vasopressor
infusions were titrated and tapered according to protocols to maintain
a target blood pressure. The primary endpoint was major morbidity
according to STS (30-day mortality, mechanical ventilation >48 hours,
mediastinitis, surgical re-exploration, stroke, acute renal failure).
Secondary outcomes were time on mechanical ventilation, ICU and
hospital stay, new infection, the time to attainment of hemodynamic
stability, occurrence of adverse events and safety.

Results A total of 300 patients underwent randomization, were
infused with the study drug (148 patients received vasopressin, and
152 norepinephrine), and were included in the analysis. Patients who
received vasopressin had a lower rate of morbidity (23.5% vs. 34%,
P = 0.001) as compared with the norepinephrine group. The 30-day
mortality rate was 6.1% in the norepinephrine group and 4.6% in the
vasopressin group (P = 0.570). There were no significant differences in
the overall rates of serious adverse events (7.4% and 6.6%, respectively;
P=0.772).

Conclusion Vasopressin reduces major morbidity after cardiac surgery
as compared with norepinephrine among patients with cardiac surgery
with vasoplegic shock.

Introduction Counterpulsation is an important support for patients
with cardiac diseases. The use of these devices has been limited
typically to hospitals with a cardiac surgery service. The aim of this
study is to describe the management of patients with an intraaortic
balloon pump (IABP) in our second-level institution.

Methods An observational study that includes all patients with IABP
in our hospital from January 2010 to September 2012, followed to
November 2012. Epidemiological and clinical variables as an indication
of IABP, therapeutic management and outcome were collected.
Because of the small size sample, statistical analysis was limited to
descriptive parameters.

Results Seventeen patients (76.5% men, age 66.6 + 11.6 (43 to 85) years,
APACHE score 21.5 + 14.9 (3 to 46) points) were treated with IABP. The
reason for ICU admission was STEMI (n = 6 patients, 35.3%), no-STEMI
(n = 5, 29.4%), acute heart failure (n = 4, 23.5%) and out-of-hospital

cardiac arrest (n = 2, 11.8%). The indications of IABP were refractory
cardiogenic shock (n = 12, 70.6%), high-risk percutaneous coronary
intervention (n = 2, 11.8%), refractory angina (n = 1, 5.9%), refractory
pulmonary edema (n = 1, 5.9%) and electrical storm (n = 1, 5.9%).
Five IABPs (27.4%) were inserted in the ICU and the rest in the
catheterization laboratory. Six patients (35.3%) suffered a cardiac
arrest prior to hemodynamic stabilization. Three patients (17.6%, the
electrical storm and the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest) died before
coronary catheterization was performed and the other three were
treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia. Thirteen patients (76.5%)
needed invasive mechanical ventilation. In six patients (35.3%) invasive
hemodynamic monitoring was performed (one pulmonary artery
catheter, five PICCO). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed
in all patients and transesophageal in six (35.3%). Six of the patients
(35.3%) were transferred to the reference centre for immediate coronary
artery bypass grafting (CABG). No complications were reported during
the transfer. During the ICU stay, femoral artery pseudoaneurysm was
reported in one of the patients and inguinal hematoma after IABP
withdrawal in two (no transfusion required). Four patients (27.4%) died
because of refractory cardiogenic shock despite revascularization. The
length of mechanical support was 1.67 + 1.5 days (0 to 6).

Conclusion In our hospital the IABP was mainly used in refractory
cardiogenic shock because of myocardial ischemia, with an all-cause
mortality of 41.2%. Low rates of complications were observed. Transfer
of patients with IABP was performed safely.

Impact of left ventricular ejection fraction and elevated filling
pressures on mortality in mechanically ventilated patients in severe
sepsis or septic shock

S Gillespie, J Pulido

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P224 (doi: 10.1186/cc12162)

Introduction Myocardial dysfunction in septic shock is common and
the presentation is broad. There are conflicting data regarding the
prognostic implications of low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and
elevated E/e’ ratio on mortality in this patient population. We sought
to assess the impact of LV dysfunction and elevated E/e’ ratio on 30-
day mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with severe sepsis or
septic shock.

Methods Fifty-eight mechanically ventilated patients with severe
sepsis or septic shock admitted from 1 August 2007 to 31 January
2009 were prospectively evaluated with transthoracic echocardiogram
within 24 hours of admission. Left ventricular ejection fraction was
assessed using the modified Simpson method as recommended by
the American Society of Echocardiography. Normal LV function was
defined as LVEF 40%. Mitral inflow pulsed wave Doppler of peak E
waves and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of the septal mitral annulus
peak velocities were measured, the E/e’ ratio was obtained. Elevated LV
filling pressures was defined as E/e’>15.

Results All cause 30-day mortality was 50% (n = 29). Forty-six patients
(79%) had normal LV function. Forty-four (76%) patients had normal
LV filling pressures. Patients who survived had lower E/e’ ratio, (median
E/e’10.6 + 4 vs. 13.6 + 7, P=0.1) but this was not statistically significant.
However, when defined as E/e’ >15, the mortality was 71%. On the
contrary, patients with low LVEF had a mortality of 41% and LVEF was
no different between survivors and nonsurvivors (55 + 16 vs. 58 + 14,
P=0.34).

Conclusion Myocardial dysfunction is a well-known entity in patients
with septic shock. The clinical spectrum of this entity is broad, including
LV, RV and diastolic dysfunction. Although the E/e’ ratio has been a
known prognostic indicator in other cardiac conditions, its role in these
patients is less clear. This study demonstrated that when septal mitral
annulus E/e’ was >15, it was a better marker for mortality than LVEF
in mechanically ventilated patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.
Larger studies incorporating diastolic evaluation and TDI should be
performed to further clarify this finding.

Effect of B-blockers and calcium channel blockers on shock index
predictability in patients suffering from urosepsis

Introduction In our busy emergency departments the identification of
patients at risk of rapid hemodynamic decompensation is crucial. The
shock index (SI) (pulse/systolic blood pressure) is a non-invasive clinical
sign associated with more complications if higher than 0.7. The effect
of B-blockers (BB) and calcium channel blockers (CCB) on the SI has
not yet been described. Most studies excluded these patients, owing
to the medications’ effect on the cardiac pulse. Considering that BB
and CCB are commonly prescribed, we studied their effect on the Sl’s
predictability on 30-day mortality in a urosepsis population.

Methods This single-center post-hoc analysis of prospectively collected
data was conducted in an academic Canadian emergency department
(ED) between March 2008 and February 2011. Data were extracted
from two institutional databases. We included patients with a final
diagnosis of urosepsis, sepsis, pyelonephritis and urinary tract infection.
Selected patients also had a documented positive urine culture. The SI
predictability on 30-day mortality was calculated for patients taking
BB and/or CCB as well as patients taking none of these medications.
Sensitivity and specificity were determined using ROC curves. t tests
were used to compare mean SI between both groups.

Results Our urosepsis population contained 364 patients, of which 129
(35.4%) were either using a BB, a CCB or both before their admission.
Mean age was 74.9 years and 48.1% of the patients were women. A total
of 36 patients died (9.9%) in a 30-day period. The group taking either BB
or CCB had a significantly lower mean SI (0.76, 95% Cl: 0.72 to 0.81 vs.
0.93, 95% Cl: 0.89 to 0.98, P <0.0001). In our urosepsis population, a SI
of 0.7 had a sensitivity of 0.76 and a specificity of 0.27 (area under the
curve (AUC): 0.596) for patients taking neither BB nor CCB. In the group
taking either or both medications, a SI of 0.7 had a sensitivity of 0.57
and a specificity of 0.42 (AUC: 0.578). In both groups, lowering the SI to
0.5 increased the sensitivity to more than 0.95 but lowered specificity
significantly.

Conclusion To our knowledge this is the only study analysing the effect
of BB and CCB on the SI predictability of 30-day mortality. Our results
indicate that SI] cannot be used to accurately predict mortality with
patients suffering from urosepsis. In both our groups, SI performance
was poor, as shown by the ROC curves. BB or CCB did not influence
these results.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P226 (doi: 10.1186/cc12164)

Introduction Levosimendan improves haemodynamic performance
and may have cardioprotective effects. Small trials have demonstrated
efficacy in well-defined populations [1]. Given the uncertain benefits
we describe contemporaneous patient selection, utilisation of
levosimedan, haemodynamic effects and outcomes.

Methods The study was performed at a single centre's three ICUs.
Data from 38 consecutive admissions, from 2010 to 2012, treated
with levosimendan were collected retrospectively. Demographics,
illness severity, comorbidity, haemodynamic, metabolic, biochemical,
resource utilisation, organ support and hospital outcomes were
analysed.

Results Our cohort had a mean age of 58 (95% Cl = 53.4 to 64.4). Only
18% underwent cardiothoracic surgery: sepsis, pulmonary emboli and
myocardial/pericardial diseases were also treated with levosimendan.
Admission characteristics included mean PaO./FiO, ratio (PFR) of
186.7 mmHg (95% Cl = 160 to 212) and mean cardiac index (Cl) of 2.3
(95% Cl 1.9 to 2.8). The median APACHE II score was 24 (interquartile
range 18.5 to 30). Levosimendan was initiated at a variable point
during ICU treatment (days 0 to 14) and was usually the third inotrope

(range 0 to 5) commenced. Treatment with levosimendan (Table 1)
resulted in improved Cl and PFR with reductions in EVLW, BE, lactate
and creatinine. The ICU length of stay was 15.4 days (95% Cl = 13.2 to
17.6) and the hospital mortality was 54%. No significant adverse effects
were reported.
Conclusion Levosimendan is usually used in patients with cardiogenic
shock unresponsive to conventional inotropes or mechanical
augmentation. The mortality of this group is high but represents
patients with shock refractory to conventional treatment. Its use in
sepsis, myocarditis and pulmonary embolism is not well established.
In this group levosimendan appears to have a favourable effect on
gas exchange, renal function and tissue perfusion. Limitations include
retrospective analysis and missing data.

Levosimendan versus dobutamine in Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy
FR Righetti, MP Parolini, GC Castellano

St. Boniface Hospital Verona, Italy

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P227 (doi: 10.1186/cc12165)

Introduction Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy is a clinical entity charac-
terized by a dysfunction of the left ventricle, usually transient, which
manifests itself with symptoms that can mimic an acute coronary
syndrome. It is characterized by transient ballooning modification of
the left ventricular apex, probably due to neurogenic stimuli resulting in
low cardiac output syndrome. The aim of this prospective randomized
study was to evaluate, by serial transesophageal echocardiography
(TEE), what is the best drug treatment between levosimendan and
dobutamine to restore a satisfactory cardiac function in the case of low
cardiac output.

Methods Twelve adult patients, aged 18 years, were admitted to
the ICU with Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy at entrance. The patients
were divided randomly into two groups: levosimendan (six patients)
treated with levosimendan and standard treatment, and the control
group (six patients) with dobutamine and standard treatment. In all
patients, serial TEE was performed studying the systolic function, by
ejection fraction of the left ventricle with Simpson’s method. The TEEs
were performed at the entrance of the patient, after 12 and 24 hours
of treatment. The results were expressed as mean with standard
deviation. For the comparison between the two groups we used the
Fisher test, considered significant with P <0.05.

Results Patients in the two groups were statistically comparable with
respect to sex (P = 0.31) and age (P= 0.53). The causes of the syndrome
of Tako-tsubo were: subarachnoid hemorrhage (six patients) after
coronary artery bypass graft (four patients), and polytrauma (two
patients). All patients had low cardiac output. In the levosimendan
group the ejection fraction at entrance was 25 + 6%, after 12 hours
36 + 10%, and 47 + 5% after 24 hours. In the control group the ejection
fraction at entrance was 24 + 7%, after 12 hours 28 + 6% and after
24 hours 33 + 4%. Comparing the two groups we reached statistical
significance, P = 0.026.

Conclusion Comparing the two groups, we noticed that both started
from a low cardiac output. However, in the group who used the drug
therapy based on levosimendan we saw a return of systolic function
of the left ventricle to near-normal levels within 24 hours, while in the

S85

control group there remains a dysfunction in systolic function. We

have shown the drug therapy based on levosimendan contributes to

improving the systolic function of the left ventricle compared with

treatment with dobutamine despite the initial cardiac stunning.

Combined effects of ivabradine with dobutamine or levosimendan
in isolated perfused hearts

D Konrad, R Vicenzi-Moser, M Vicenzi, U Aldenhoff, E Schwarzl, W Toller
Medical University Graz, Austria

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P228 (doi: 10.1186/cc12166)

Introduction Dobutamine and levosimendan improve cardiac
contractility in patients with heart failure, septic cardiomyopathy or
cardiac surgery. Tachycardia in these cases is undesired because of
aggravating ischemia. lvabradine, a selective sinus node inhibitor,
does not affect contractility. A combination of ivabradine with positive
inotropic drugs might be favorable. Thus, we compared the cardiac
effects of dobutamine or levosimendan alone, and combined with
ivabradine using the Langendorff method of isolated perfused hearts.
Methods Isolated guinea pig hearts (n = 37) were perfused with
incremental doses of dobutamine (10 nM to 10 uM) or levosimendan
(30 nM to 10 uM) either alone or combined with 3 uM ivabradine.
Heart rate (HR), left ventricular pressures, contractility (+dLVP/dt) and
relaxation (—-dLVP/dt) were recorded. Data for each drug (dobutamine
or levosimendan) were analyzed by two-way ANOVA for repeated
measures including the two main effects of ivabradine and drug dose
and their interaction. Data are reported as mean + standard deviation.
Results lvabradine decreased the HR from 223 + 18 to 196 + 15 bpm
(P <0.05). Contractility and relaxation remained unchanged. lvabradine
reduced the positive chronotropic effect at all doses of dobutamine
(10 nM: 232 + 37 vs. 187 + 19, 100 nM: 265 + 37 vs. 211 + 40, 1 uM:
316 + 35 vs. 250 + 39, 10 uM: 320 + 33 vs. 235 + 40 bpm; P <0.05). It
shifted the maximum positive inotropic action of dobutamine to lower
dose ranges (100 nM: 2,924 + 841 vs. 2,978 + 955, 300 nM: 3,743 + 925
vs. 4,795 + 1,298, 1 UM: 4,138 + 935 vs. 4,896 + 1,861 mmHg/second;
P <0.05). A comparable shift was seen for relaxation (100 nM:
-2,178 + 686 vs. -2,520 + 742, 300 nM: -2,615 + 726 vs. -3,150 + 888,
1 uM: -2,903 + 752 vs. -2,972 + 967 mmHg/second; P <0.05).
Levosimendan increased the HR only at high doses. With ivabradine, no
positive chronotropic effect of levosimendan was observed (100 nM:
185 + 30 vs. 162 + 22, 1 uM: 208 + 28 vs. 166 + 29, 10 UM: 242 + 27 vs.
168 + 36 bpm; P <0.05). lvabradine attenuated the positive inotropic
effect of levosimendan (100 nM: 2,303 + 303 vs. 1,737 + 262, 1 UM:
2,977 + 481 vs. 1,940 + 449, 10 uM: 3,480 + 941 vs. 2,189 + 542 mmHg/
second; P <0.05) but did not significantly alter its lusitropic effect.
Conclusion Addition of ivabradine to dobutamine attenuates its
chronotropic actions without diminishing its inotropic effects. A
combination of levosimendan with ivabradine does not seem to
provide benefit. Clinical studies are necessary to confirm these
experimental results.

Medical University Graz, Austria

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P229 (doi: 10.1186/cc12167)

Introduction Inotropic agents (catecholamines or calcium-sensitizers)
are frequently used in hypothermic as well as hyperthermic patient
conditions. Divergent results from animal experiments raise doubt as
to whether they act to the same extent at different body temperatures.
Thus, we studied the influence of clinically relevant temperatures on
the hemodynamic effects of dobutamine and levosimendan using the
Langendorff model of isolated perfused hearts.

----$$$$----$$$$----
Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2
http://ccforum.com/supplements/17/S2

Methods Isolated guinea pig hearts (n = 60) were perfused with
incremental doses (10 nM to 10 uM) of dobutamine or levosimendan
either at normothermic (37°C), hyperthermic (40°C) or hypothermic
(34°C) perfusion conditions. Contractility (+dLVP/dt), relaxation
(-dLVP/dt), left ventricular pressures and heart rate were recorded. Data
with increasing drug dosage were calculated in percent from baseline
for each temperature tested. Data for each drug were analysed by two-
way ANOVA for repeated measures including the two main effects of
temperature and drug dose and their interaction. Data are reported as
mean + standard deviation.

Results The positive inotropic action of dobutamine was least at 37°C,
more pronounced at 40°C and best at 34°C (37°C vs. 40°C vs. 34°C: 300
nM 280 + 71 vs. 301 + 94 vs. 345 + 99%, 1 UM 310 + 74 vs. 327 + 92
vs. 389 + 144%, 10 UM 297 + 69 vs. 339 + 96 vs. 359 + 175%; P <0.05).
Dobutamine’s positive lusitropic effect was not significantly altered by
temperature. The positive inotropic action of levosimendan was best at
37°C, in hyperthermia and hypothermia only the three highest doses
of levosimendan increased contractility (37°C vs. 40°C vs. 34°C: 100 nM
121 + 21 vs. 134 + 15 vs. 87 + 12%, 300 nM 135 + 22 vs. 137 + 17 vs.
94 + 15%, 1 UM 153 + 22 vs. 147 + 21 vs. 108 + 21%, 3 UM 172 + 19
vs. 150 + 24 vs. 115 + 23%, 10 UM 173 + 31 vs. 156 + 28 vs. 117 + 28%;
P <0.05). The positive lusitropic effect of levosimendan at 37°C was
almost absent in hypothermia and hyperthermia (P <0.05).
Conclusion In isolated perfused hearts, dobutamine has its best
positive inotropic effect in hypothermia whereas levosimendan
increases contractility best at normothermic conditions. Clinical studies
are necessary to confirm these experimental results.

Conflicting results between V/Q SPECT and angioscan in pulmonary
embolism: what to do?

JM Martel, MN Nadeau, RD Daoust, JP Paquet, JC Chauny

Hopital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, Canada

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P230 (doi: 10.1186/cc12168)

Introduction The objective of this study is to determine the final
clinical diagnosis of patients who underwent the double investigation
for pulmonary embolism with conflicting results. Pulmonary embolism
is a prevalent pathology in the emergency department (ED). A certain
proportion of patients undergo a double radiological investigation
(V/Q SPECT and angioscan), which incurs higher costs and X-ray doses.
However, no study to date has addressed this issue.

Methods This retrospective study included patients who underwent
a double investigation in the ED of Hdpital du Sacré-Coeur de
Montréal from April 2008 to October 2012. Patients were selected
from a computerized database of medical prescriptions (MediaMed
Technologie). Data were then extracted from the patient’s files: patient
characteristics, radiology report, diagnosis and treatment. Descriptive
statistics were conducted.

Results In all, 125 patients underwent the double investigation. Our
sample had a mean age of 63.1 years (SD 18.6) and was composed of
82 (65.6%) women. One hundred and fifteen patients (92%) underwent
the V/Q SPECT first. The result of 66 (52.8%) SPECT was intermediate
or indeterminate. The final diagnosis was pulmonary embolism for
23 patients (18.4%). A significant proportion of patients (19, 38.0%)
had conflicting results with the two tests. In this subpopulation, four
(21.1%) had a final diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. In the 16 patients
with a result of high probability V/Q SPECT and negative angioscan,
one (6.3%) had a final diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, but three
(100%) with low probability SPECT and positive angioscan were given
this final diagnosis.

Conclusion Most patients underwent the double investigation
because of intermediate or indeterminate V/Q SPECT results. In case
of conflicting results, clinicians based their decision on the angioscan.
In future studies, it would be useful to identify contributing factors for
this discordance.

Care Medicine, Bangkok, Thailand

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P231 (doi: 10.1186/cc12169)

Introduction Intraabdominal hypertension (IAH), especially abdominal
compartment syndrome (ACS), can affect organ function leading
to multiple organ failure. Appropriate and prompt management
could improve survival. Less recognition of this problem in critically
ill patients has been reported. The aim of this study was to study the
prevalence, predictive factors and clinical outcome of IAH and ACS in
a mixed population of critically ill patients by intermittent measuring
bladder pressure during the ICU stay.

Methods This prospective observational study was done in 130 adult
patients (age >18 years) admitted to a medical and general surgical
ICU at a third referral university hospital during June to November
2011. Variables about the patient's profile laboratory data and clinical
outcome as ICU and hospital length of stay, and ICU, in-hospital and
28-day mortality were recorded.

Results There were 33 (25.4%) medical and 93 (74.6%) surgical ICU
patients in this study. Surgical patients had higher prevalence of IAH
than medical patients (57.8% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.015). Medical patients
were admitted with severe sepsis/septic shock, AKI, pneumonia and
ARDS. Surgical patients were more acutely ill with high ASA (III to IV),
severity score, underwent emergency abdominal surgery and received
more transfusion but were no different in type of fluid replacement.
Significant risk factors of IAH were coagulopathy (OR = 2.09, 95%
Cl = 1.62 to 2.69), intraabdominal infection (OR = 1.87, 95% Cl = 1.40
to 2.48), retroperitonium hematoma (OR = 1.82, 95% Cl = 1.36 to 2.44),
marked ascites (OR = 1.76, 95% Cl = 1.32 to 2.36), acidosis (pH <7.2)
(OR = 1.82, 95% Cl = 1.37 to 2.43), severe sepsis/septic shock (OR = 1.63,
95% Cl = 1.14 to 2.33), and massive transfusion (OR = 1.51, 95%
Cl = 1.10 to 2.08). Patients with IAH had more reopened surgeries and
had higher ICU, hospital and 28-day mortality. Sixteen (12.3%) patients
had ACS, 15 patients underwent emergency surgery, two patients
had temporary abdominal closured and one-half of the patients had
severe abdominal sepsis and massive transfusion. Fourteen patients
died despite temporary abdominal closure. Delayed release abdominal
tamponade were most causes of death.

Conclusion The prevalence and morbidity/mortality of IAH and ACS
were high in this institute. Early appropriate and prompt management,
especially fluid and releasing a tamponade effect, were important.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P232 (doi: 10.1186/cc121 70)

Introduction The red-cell distribution width (RDW) is associated
with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and is a predictor of ICU
survival. It was the aim of this study to investigate the potential of RDW
to predict postoperative cardiovascular complications (new onset of
treated arrhythmias, myocardial ischaemia or initiation of vasopressor
support) and its association with markers of tissue perfusion (serum
lactate >2.5 mmol/l).

Methods Analysis of prospectively recorded data for a register of
patients admitted to an 18-bed ICU in a large teaching hospital
after undergoing high-risk surgery. Haemodynamic and laboratory
parameters during the first 12 hours of ICU stay were recorded as
well as demographic characteristics. Assessment for postoperative
complications was performed using the postoperative morbidity
survey and the Clavien-Dindo classification. In addition, clinical
outcome data (hospital mortality, length of ICU stay, length of hospital
stay, readmission to the ICU) were recorded.

Results A total of 119 patients were included. Seventy-six (63%)
patients developed complications postoperatively. Thirty patients
(25.2%) developed cardiovascular complications. These patients had
a higher median RDW than patients without cardiovascular compli-
cations (14.7 vs. 13.8%, P <0.05). RDW on ICU admission was associated
with serum lactate concentration on ICU admission: receiver operating
characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.68 (SE = 0.06,
P=0.005; see Figure 1). RDW >14.35% predicted hyperlactataemia with
a sensitivity of 76.0% and a specificity of 71.1%.

Conclusion RDW is a potential parameter for perioperative risk
stratification. Further studies will have to elucidate the ability of acute
elevations in RDW to reflect impaired tissue perfusion.

Introduction Obesity is a disease that affects a large part of the
population and has been associated with worse outcomes after cardiac
surgery. The aim of our study is to evaluate the consequences of
obesity related to postoperative complications, hospital length of stay
and mortality.

Methods An observational, prospective, multicenter study of patients
included in the ARIAM registry of adult cardiac surgery between March
2008 and March 2011. We analyzed clinical variables, the surgical
procedure, postoperative complications and mortality, comparing
the group of patients with body mass index (BMI) greater or less than
30 kg/m.

Results The study included 4,712 patients with a mean age of 64.03 (SD
+12.08) years, BMI 28.53 (SD +4.7) and EuroSCORE 5.58 (SD +2.91). In
1,940 patients (35.7%) BMI was >30 kg/m’. There were no differences

S87

in the development of overall postoperative complications (33% in
obese and 35.8% in nonobese, P = 0.07), although less appreciated
were reoperation rate or stroke, as well as further development of
postoperative renal failure. After adjusting for severity and length
of cardio bypass time, obese patients had lower mortality without
being statistically significant, OR = 0.94 (0.79 to 1.04). There were no
differences in ICU length of stay, but obese patients had greater ward
length of stay, 9.04 (10.43) versus 1.18 (9.2) days, P= 0.01.

Conclusion Obese patients undergoing cardiac surgery have mortality,
rate of complications and length of stay similar to nonobese patients.
Obese patients required less reoperation but developed more frequent
postoperative renal failure.

Introduction In the critically ill, the incidence of raised cardiac troponin
T (cTnT) levels is high. Although the mechanisms of myocardial injury
are not well understood, raised cTnT levels are associated with increased
mortality. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence,
prevalence and outcome of silent myocardial injury as determined by
raised cInT levels and concomitant ECG changes in critically ill patients
admitted for noncardiac reasons.

Methods ECGs were taken and cTnT was measured daily during the first
week and on alternate days during the second week until discharge
from the ICU or death. After completion of the study, all cTnT levels and
ECGs were analysed independently and patients were classified into
four groups: definite MI (cTnT =15 ng/Il and definite ECG changes of Ml),
possible MI (cTnT =15 ng/I and ischaemic changes on ECG), troponin
rise alone (cTnT 215 ng/I with no ischaemic ECG changes), or normal.
All medical notes were reviewed independently by two ICU clinicians.
Results A total of 144 patients were included in the analysis (42%
female; mean age 61.9 (SD 16.9); mean APACHE II score 19.4). In total,
121 patients (84%) had at least one cTInT level =15 ng/I during their
stay in the ICU. Twenty patients (14%) fulfilled criteria for a definite MI,
of whom 65% were septic and 50% were on noradrenaline at the time
(ICU and hospital mortality: 25% and 30%, respectively). Thirty-nine
patients (27%) had a possible MI, of whom 69% were septic and on
noradrenaline (ICU and hospital mortality: 31% and 41%, respectively).
Sixty-two patients (43%) had a raised troponin without ECG, of whom
69% were septic and 50.7% were on noradrenaline (ICU and hospital
mortality: 23% and 31%, respectively). Twenty-three patients had
normal cTnT results and serial ECGs, of whom 61% had sepsis. ICU
and hospital mortality was 4%. Only 25% of definite Mls and 18% of
possible Mls were recognised by the clinical teams at the time.
Conclusion Eighty-four per cent of critically ill patients had a raised
cTnT level at some stage during their stay in the ICU. More than 40% of
patients fulfilled criteria for a possible or definite MI, of whom only 20%
were recognised clinically. |CU and hospital outcome were significantly
worse in patients with a cTnT rise. The proportion of patients with sepsis
was similar between the patients with a definite, possible or no MI.

6 months of hospital discharge in patients with acute coronary
syndrome (ACS). Our aim was to assess the validity of this risk score
in our contemporary cohort of patients admitted to our third-level
hospital.

Methods The study involved 1,185 consecutive patients with ACS
evaluated between February 2004 and February 2009. Their virtual
status was determined 6 months after hospital discharge and the
validity of the GRACE risk score was evaluated.

Results In total, 450 (38.8%) patients were admitted for STEMI and 725
(61.2%) for NSTEMI. Percutaneous revascularisation was performed
in 846 (71.5%). The median GRACE risk score was 121 (interquartile
range 96/144). Mortality after discharge was 4.4%. The calibration of
the GRACE score was Hosmer—Lemeshow P >0.2 and its discriminatory
capacity was excellent. Area under the ROC curve was 0.86, 95% Cl
0.807 to 0.916, in all patients. See Table 1.

Table 1 (abstract P235)

GRACE risk Total STEMI NSTEMI
Low 270 (22.7) 177 (38.3) 93 (12.8)
Medium 334 (28.2) 141 (30.7) 193 (26.7)
High 580 (49) 142 (30.9) 438 (60.5)

Conclusion The GRACE risk score for predicting death within 6 months
of hospital discharge was validated and can be used in patients with
ACS. It would be perfect in the future to include the GRACE risk score
in the medical records of this type of patients. Also it would be very
interesting to validate this in a multicentric study.

Introduction This is a prospective study in which all ACS cases
attending a level 3 hospital were collected consecutively from February
2004 to 2010, and were clinically followed-up until 2012.

Methods Of a total 4,589 cases, only 2,515 were revascularized with ICP
(1,742 complete and 907 incomplete; 160 failed). We split the cases into
two main groups: STEMI and NSTEMI.

Results We observed a 0.6 higher accumulative survival rate in patients
with complete ICP over patients who underwent surgery, incomplete
ICP or mixed treatment. Those with conservative measures solely have,
obviously, worst prognosis. See Figures 1 and 2.

Conclusion In our study patients undergoing ICP have higher survival
rates in comparison with cardiac surgery except those >65 years old
and diabetic groups in which cardiac surgery has higher ratios than ICP.
In the rest of the groups, no matter how many coronary arteries were
affected, only those with complete ICP present higher survival rates. It
would be important to repeat this study in a multicentric cohort.

Hospital Regional Carlos Haya, Mdlaga, Spain

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P237 (doi: 10.1186/cc12175)

Introduction In patients with severe and inoperable aortic stenosis,
some trials have proven that TAVI excels standard procedures and has
also been proven less cost-effective. We aim at reviewing short-term
results after 2 years since the implementation of this technique in our
premises.

Methods A study of a retrospective cohorts of patients who underwent
isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) by either conventional
surgery or TAVI (CoreValve device) from June 2010 to December 2011
at the University Hospital Carlos de Haya (Malaga, Spain). Clinical
epidemiologic, complication and short-term outcome variables were
registered. Qualitative variables are expressed as percentages, while
quantitative variables are expressed as means and SD. Fisher's exact
test and Mann-Whitney’s U-test were used where necessary (5%
maximum error ratio).

Results A total number of 27 TAVI and 154 isolated AVR procedures
were completed. Intervention typology was chosen according to the
recommendations of scientific societies, apart from patients’ fulfillment
of the anatomic criteria required for percutaneous implant. Mean age
was 67 + 11 years (54% males) in AVR and 80 + 6 years (44% males)
in TAVI (P <0.05). The additive EuroSCORE in AVR was 7 + 2 and9 + 2
in TAVI (P <0.05). However, 55.6% of the percutaneous-valve patients
presented previous coronary-tree alterations with stent implantation,
while only 7% of AVR patients showed these alterations (P <0.001). ICU
mortality in TAVI and AVR patients was 3.7% and 8.2%, respectively
(P = NS). Regarding complications, 48.1% of TAVI patients showed
altered heart rhythm and 33% required a permanent pacemaker.
Electrical disorders were observed in 4% of AVR patients, while 1.9%
of these patients required a permanent pacemaker (P <0.001 for both).
Reoperation was necessary in 14.8 and 1.9% of TAVI and AVR patients,
respectively (P <0.001).

Conclusion Even with our limited experience, TAVI patients are
observed to be older, to involve higher surgical risk, and to have
undergone previous coronary-tree interventions. Although no

significant differences were found regarding mortality, a higher rate
of complications was observed in TAVI patients. With no short-term
differences, a significant rate of postsurgical complications, and a cost-
efficiency handicapped technique, analysis of long-term outcomes
seems necessary to assess TAVI’s advantages over conventional AVR.

Time to recover from shock is determinant of a positive fluid
balance in septic shock

Faculdade de Medicina de Sao José do Rio Preto, Brazil

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P238 (doi: 10.1186/cc12176)

Introduction Excess fluids may be harmful in critically ill patients.
We aimed to evaluate the cumulative fluid balance during 7 days in
patients with septic shock after recovery from shock.

Methods A prospective and observational study in septic shock
patients. Patients with MAP >65 mmHg and lactate <2.0 mEq/l were
included <12 hours after weaning from vasopressors. Daily fluid
balance was registered during 7 days after the enrollment. Patients
were divided into two groups according to the full cohort’s median
cumulative fluid balance administered during the period of shock (use
of vasopressors) calculated on study day 1: Group 1 <4.41 (n = 20) and
Group 2 >4.41 (n= 20).

Results Cumulative fluid balance was 1.6 + 1.8 | in Group 1 and
10.2 + 4.1 | in Group 2 and 8.5 + 5.3 | in Group 1 and 18.5 + 7.9 | in
Group 2 on study day 8 (P <0.001 for both). Time for recovery from
shock was predictive of receiving larger volume of fluids (OR: 1.38, 95%
Cl: 1.08 to 1.75, P = 0.009). After zeroing fluid balance on study day 2,
7 days cumulative fluid balance continues to increase in both groups
(Figure 1). Patients in Group 2 had more prolonged length of stay in the
ICU and in hospital than patients in Group 1.

Lactate clearance is a predictor of sustained bleeding in emergency
room patients with moderate upper gastrointestinal bleeding

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P239 (doi: 10.1186/cc12177)

Introduction There is no useful predictor of sustained upper gastro-
intestinal bleeding (UGIB). Glasgow-Blatchford scoring (GBS) is based
on simple clinical and laboratory variables and can predict whether a

S89

UGIB patient needs an intervention or not. However, the intervention
which the GBS mentions includes not only endoscopy but also blood
transfusion. Therefore, we cannot determine whether a UGIB patient
needs urgent endoscopy or just blood transfusion by GBS alone. We
hypothesized that high lactate clearance (CLac) would decrease the
likelihood of sustained UGIB.

Methods This is a retrospective study. UGIB patients, who visited the
emergency department (ED) of the National Center for Global Health
and Medicine from April 2011 to March 2012 and received urgent
endoscopy in the ED, were enrolled. We collected for each patient
the GBS, the blood lactate value on arrival in the ED, the blood lactate
value after bolus administration of 20 to 40 ml/kg Ringer's acetate
(initial fluid therapy) and the report of urgent endoscopy. We classified
the severity of UGIB according to GBS. A score <12 was classified as
moderate, and a score >13 was classified as severe. CLac was defined
as the percentage decrease in blood lactate from the time of arrival
in the ED to the time when an initial fluid therapy was finished. CLac
<50% was defined as low, and CLac >50% was defined as high. Whether
a patient had sustained bleeding or not was determined based on
the report of urgent endoscopy. The relationship between CLac and
sustained bleeding was examined by Fisher's exact test, and P <0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Results Seventy-nine patients were enrolled. Fifty-one patients
were with moderate UGIB, and 28 patients were with severe UGIB.
As indicated in Tables 1 and 2, there was a significant relationship
between CLac and sustained bleeding in moderate UGIB (P = 0.02). On
the other hand, there was no significant relationship between CLac and
sustained bleeding in severe UGIB (P = 0.58).

sustained bleeding in moderate UGIB (n = 51)

Conclusion If an initial fluid therapy for moderate UGIB results in high
CLac, the bleeding might already have stopped. For such a patient, we
may save urgent endoscopy.

Introduction The aim of our study was to assess the muscular glucose
by microdialysis and its association with mortality in septic shock
patients.

Methods We conducted a preliminary prospective study. We included
septic shock patients hemodynamically optimized according to
international recommendations. A microdialysis catheter was inserted
in the femoral quadriceps. Interstitial fluid samples were collected
every 6 hours for 5 days. The determination of muscular glucose was
performed by the CMA 600 analyzer (CMA/Microdialysis AB, Sweden).
We also performed a dosage of concomitant blood glucose. The
study population was divided into two groups according to hospital
mortality. Statistic analysis: Mann-Whitney test and chi-squared test:

comparisons between groups. Quantitative variables were expressed
as mean + standard deviation or median (interquartile range) as
appropriate.

Results We included 12 patients with septic shock. The mortality rate
was 50%. Demographics were comparable between groups except
for age (66 + 9 vs. 41 + 12, dead patients vs. survivors, respectively;
P=0.002). Pneumonia was the major cause of septic shock (10 patients).
We analysed 167 blood samples and 166 muscular glucose samples.
We found a positive association between muscular glucose, blood
glucose and mortality. Tissue glucose was significantly higher among
dead patients compared with survivors at the 54th hour. Comparing all
data, muscular glucose (P = 0.02) and blood glucose (P = 0.007) were
significantly higher in dead patients (Table 1).

Table 1 (abstract P240). Association between muscular glucose, blood
glucose and mortality

Dead patients Survivors
(n =6) (n= 6) Pvalue
Muscular glucose (mmol/|) 94 (5.66; 13.71) 7.87 (5.62; 10.41) 0.02
Blood glucose (mmol/|) 10.9 (8.3; 15.5) 8.6 (6.9; 11.4) 0.007

Conclusion Our data suggest that muscular glucose assessed by
microdialysis and blood glucose are associated with mortality in septic
shock patients. Therefore, muscular glucose may reflect the metabolic
alterations and microcirculatory dysfunction induced by septic shock.

Constipation in critically ill patients and its relationship to feeding
and weaning from respiratory support

E Spodniewska, A Guha

Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P241 (doi: 10.1186/cc12179)

Introduction Constipation can be defined as a failure of the bowels to
open for 3 consecutive days. It is a common problem in intensive care
settings but not many studies have so far raised the subject.
Methods The audit had the Trust Audit Committee’s approval. The
existing protocol was used as the benchmark. Patients were studied
prospectively to assess compliance with the local bowel protocol,
incidence of constipation and relationship to weaning from respiratory
support and feeding. All HDU and all mechanically ventilated
ICU patients who stayed on the ward for more than 3 days were
included, except for patients after bowel surgery and patients with
encephalopathy.
Results Among the 24 HDU and 21 ICU patients audited in the
Royal Liverpool University Hospital, 67% and 57% respectively were
constipated. Laxatives were prescribed when patients had not opened
their bowels for 3 days in 25% HDU and 75% ICU cases. Taking into
consideration that the median age, APACHE Il score and length
of stay for constipated and nonconstipated patients were similar,
the relationship to feeding and respiratory support were assessed.
Constipated patients required mechanical ventilation for an average of
6.8 days and nonconstipated for 4.3 days. Failure to feed was observed
at least once in 58% constipated and 44% nonconstipated ICU patients
and 19% constipated and 12.5% nonconstipated HDU patients.
Conclusion There was a high prevalence of constipation among critical
care patients with poor adherence to the bowel protocol, which requires
improvements in staff awareness and new recommendations (drug chart
amendment, and so forth). Duration of mechanical ventilation and failure
to feed were greater in constipated than nonconstipated patients. This
may indicate a common correlation and further studies are warranted.
Due to the possible significant impact of constipation on patients’
recovery, each critical care unit should introduce a bowel protocol or
ensure compliance with the existing one before the evidence is clearly
established.

Nasogastric tube dislodgement: a problem on our ICU
B Morton, R Hall, T Ridgway, O Al-Rawi

Liverpool Heart & Chest, Liverpool, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P242 (doi: 10.1186/cc12180)

Introduction It was noted on our unit that dislodgement of nasogastric
tubes occurred commonly. This can lead to an increased risk of
aspiration, interruptions in nutritional support, skin breakdown and
radiographic exposure [1]. It is recommended that the position of
nasogastric tubes should be confirmed by aspiration and pH testing,
with radiographic confirmation used only when this is not possible [2].
Methods We performed a retrospective review of chest X-ray (CXR)
requests for the 3-month period June to August 2012 using the trust
radiology information system. The proportion of CXR requests for
confirmation of position and patient demographics were measured
with an estimation of the financial cost performed.

Results There were 541 patients admitted to the critical care area in
the study period. In total, 207 out of 2,340 (8.8%) CXRs performed were
for confirmation of position. Repeated X-rays were required in some
patients (see Table 1); these patients were older and tended to have
a longer length of stay. A mobile CXR costs £25 in our trust, if one CXR
is accepted per patient with a nasogastric tube; there was an excess of
160 images with a cost of £4,000 in the 3-month period.

Conclusion An excess of CXRs were performed for confirmation
of nasogastric tube in our patient population. The recommended
methods for position confirmation were reinforced amongst medical
staff. The high number of repeated imaging for some patients indicates
that dislodgement of tubes was also a problem. We propose that
nasogastric tubes should be bridled after first dislodgement or at
tracheostomy insertion to minimise dislodgement in the future.

Introduction Protein turnover measurements by stable isotope
techniques can be applied to assess the nutritional/metabolic status in
critically ill patients and their response to feeding. Because of uncertain
gastrointestinal transport and uptake of nutrients, their contribution
needs to be measured separately. We studied whole-body protein
kinetics, with special emphasis on the contribution of dietary protein,
in ICU patients and healthy controls.

Methods Mechanically ventilated, not enterally fed ICU patients (n = 9)
were recruited from an interdisciplinary ICU. Healthy, overnight-fasted
volunteers (n = 6) served as reference. A primed constant i.v. infusion
of *H-labeled phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine was used to quantify
whole-body protein metabolism. Patients remained on parenteral
nutrition (PN) as clinically indicated; controls received PN starting
2.5 hours before starting enteral feeding. Intrinsically '*C-Phe-labeled
casein was infused for 6 hours by nasogastric tube at 0.75 g protein/
hour, together with maltodextrin at 2.73 g/hour. Protein breakdown,
synthesis, net balance, and Phe splanchnic extraction were calculated
before and at the end of the enteral feeding period, using equations
for steady-state whole-body protein kinetics. Comparisons were made
by Wilcoxon matched pairs and Mann-Whitney U tests; values are
reported as mean + SD.

Results Protein net balance was lower in patients than in the reference
group at baseline (-1.8 + 1.7 vs. 0.6 + 0.6 mg/kg BW/hour, P = 0.003),
and after enteral feeding (-1.1 + 1.5 vs. 0.6 + 0.6 mg/kg BW/hour,
P = 0.049). Recovery of labelled Phe from enteral feeding into the
systemic circulation was higher in the reference group as compared
with patients (20.3 + 11.2% vs. 7.0 + 4.8%, P = 0.005). Enteral feeding
did not affect protein metabolism in the reference group. In patients,
protein breakdown became slightly lower during enteral feeding
(10.6 + 3.3 vs. 11.2 + 3.3 mg/kg BW/hour, P = 0.086) and protein net
balance became slightly higher (-1.1 + 1.5 vs. -1.8 + 1.7 mg/kg BW/
hour, P = 0.086).

Conclusion Intrinsically isotope-labelled casein can be used to
quantify dietary contribution to protein metabolism in critically ill
patients. Hypocaloric enteral feeding marginally improved protein
balance in these patients. The low recovery of enterally administered
labelled amino acid underlines the need to quantify uptake from
the gastrointestinal tract when protein turnover measurements are
performed in critically ill patients on enteral nutrition.

Confirmation of nasogastric tube placement in critical care
M Moore, R Thomson

St Georges Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P244 (doi: 10.1186/cc12182)

Introduction Placement of nasogastric tubes (NGTs) is commonplace
in critical care. Misplacement of NGTs is rare and considered a never
event [1]. Strategies to avoid never events (by confirming NGT position)
include pH analysis of gastric secretions or chest X-ray confirmation
of tube position. For this reason the authors set out to establish the
efficiencies surrounding safe placement of NGTs in a 17-bed adult
cardiothoracic critical care unit in a large teaching hospital.

Methods This small-scale study of 25 NGT placements during a 5-week
period collated data supplied by questionnaire by healthcare workers
responsible for NGT placements.

Results Analysis of Adverse Incident Reports identified no never
events of misplaced NGTs within the previous 10 years. This audit
revealed that the commonest type of NGT was a radio-opaque tube
with stylet (corflo) (92% of placements), with occasional use of the
electromagnetic placement system (cortrak) (8% of placements).
Sizes 10 (40%) and 12 (56%) were most common. Tube placement was
confirmed by: X-ray (72%); pH of aspirates (35%); electromagnetic tube
placement (one patient). The time taken from decision to place NGT to
use varied (range 15 to 510 minutes). Little distinction was seen in the
time taken to use and NGT confirmed by aspirate alone (205 minutes)
or by X-ray (220 minutes), although the shortest interval was seen
in electromagnetic NGT placement (15 minutes). The cost of NGTs
confirmed by aspirate alone was low (approximately £10.00), higher
with X-ray confirmation/electromagnetic placement (approximately
£45.00).

Conclusion Despite the small dataset the results demonstrate a
concerning delay in the application of enteral feeding and/or drug
administration. Whilst reassuring in the steps taken to avoid never
events, this study demonstrates that there may be delays in time-critical
administration of enteral medicine or optimal nutritional practices.
This study reveals a significant problem with aspirating gastric
contents for pH testing, necessitating a large number of X-ray position

$91

confirmations. Even if the frequency and volume of gastric aspiration

were greater, there is a belief that pH testing may not be sufficiently

accurate (since many factors alter patients’ gastric pH). It is possible

that new technologies such as electromagnetic NGT placement may

allow faster/equally safe practices. Further study including cost/benefit

analysis will be needed to confirm this.

PH testing to confirm nasogastric tube position on the ICU: are we
wasting our time?

P Temblett, S George

Morriston ICU, Swansea, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P245 (doi: 10.1186/cc12183)

Introduction For such a simple procedure, the insertion and position
checking of nasogastric (NG) tubes can be very problematic. The UK’s
National Patient Safety Agency declared that ‘Placement of NG tubes
together with confirmation of correct placement can carry significant
risks’ and recommends that measuring the pH of NG aspirate should
be the first-line method of determining correct NG position (safe range
<5.5) [1].

Methods In order to assess the usefulness of pH testing of NG aspirates
in critical care patients, a prospective survey of pH testing of NG tube
aspirate was carried out. This was undertaken both in patients who
had a newly placed NG tube and in patients who were having regular/
routine checks of their existing NG tube.

Results A total of 168 separate pH readings in 41 ICU patients receiving
continuous enteral nutrition were recorded. In total, 137/168 patients
were receiving proton pump inhibitors (PPls). Eighteen readings were
from newly placed NG tubes and 150 readings from old NG tubes. Fifty-
three per cent of routine pH readings were falsely high; that is, pH 6 or
above despite the NG tube being in the stomach (Figure 1). Twenty-
eight per cent of newly placed NG tubes had falsely high pH readings
(Figure 2).

Conclusion In this population of ICU patients, routine/daily checks of
NG pH aspirate appear to be limited. This is almost certainly due to the
use of continuous NG feed together with PPls. The usefulness of pH
testing in newly placed NG tubes, however, appears more reliable.

Effect of probiotic containing lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and
streptococcus thermophilus in critically ill patients

M Ebrahimi Mamaghani, S Sanaie, A Mahmoudpour, H Hamishehkar
Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P246 (doi: 10.1186/cc12184)

Introduction Sepsis is the most common cause of death in ICUs [1].
Destruction of intestinal barrier function and increased translocation
of bacteria to systemic blood flow can lead to sepsis [2]. Probiotics
may have beneficial effects in improvement of critically ill patients
by modulating intestinal barrier and reduction of inflammation
[3]. The aim of this trial was to determine the effect of probiotic on
inflammatory biomarkers and mortality rate of sepsis in critically ill
patients in the ICU.
Methods This double-blind, randomized controlled trial was
conducted on 40 critically ill patients admitted to the ICU. They were
randomly assigned to receive placebo or probiotic for 7 days. The
APACHE score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and
systemic concentrations of IL-6, procalcitonin (PCT) and protein C were
measured before initiation of the study and on days 4 and 7. Also, 28-
day mortality was evaluated for each patient.
Results IL-6 and PCT levels decreased and protein C levels increased
significantly in probiotic group over the treatment period (P <0.001).
There was a significant difference in IL-6, PCT and protein C levels of the
7th day between two groups (P= 0.001, 0.006 and <0.001, respectively).
Compared with controls, probiotic was effective in improving APACHE
and SOFA scores in 7 days (P <0.001). There was significant difference
between the probiotic and control group in the 28-day mortality rate
(20% vs. 55% respectively, P = 0.048).
Conclusion Probiotics reduce inflammation and mortality rate in
critically ill patients and might be considered as an adjunctive therapy
to sepsis.

Selenium levels in patients with different sources of sepsis
L French, P Temblett

Morriston Hospital, Swansea, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P247 (doi: 10.1186/cc12185)

Introduction The aim of this study is to establish whether different
types of sepsis have an impact on selenium levels. Selenium is an
essential trace element involved in antioxidant and immunological
reactions. Selenium levels have been shown to be low in patients
with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis. Selenium
replacement has been recommended in patients with sepsis [1,2].
Greater than 5 days of supplementation may also help to prevent the
development of new infections on ICUs [3].

Methods This is a prospective survey where selenium levels were
collected from patients admitted with septic shock to a tertiary ICU, for
6 months from October 2010 to March 2011.

Results Selenium levels were measured in 31 patients with septic shock.
Abdominal and chest sepsis were the main sources of infection. Those
with an abdominal source of sepsis had the lowest levels, as shown in
Table 1. All septic shock patients who had selenium levels taken within
the first 10 days of admission had subnormal levels (<0.8 mg/dt), and
after 10 days had levels within the normal range, as shown in Figure 1.

Conclusion All patients admitted with early septic shock had subnormal
selenium levels. Patients with an abdominal source of septic shock had
the lowest levels. This survey supports previous studies indicating early
supplementation may be beneficial in septic shock patients.

Is a combined i.v. and enteral glutamine regimen superior toa
single i.v. glutamine regimen in severe thoracic trauma?

Introduction Glutamine regulates many biological functions in
preserving the cell, acts as a key respiratory fuel and nitrogen donor
for rapidly dividing cells, and modulates the expression of many genes
associated with metabolism, cell defences and repair, and cytokine
production. In severe thoracic trauma, glutamine supplementation
is essential because the body consumes more than it produces and
glutamine effects become dependent on its route of delivery.
Methods Fifty-two patients 19 to 78 years old with surgery for severe
thoracic trauma were assessed in two groups: Group A received 0.3
to 0.5 g/kg/day i.v. glutamine + 20 g enteral glutamine for 7 days,
supplementation to enteral nutrition; Group B receive only iv.
glutamine supplementation to enteral nutrition 0.3 to 0.5 g/kg/day for
7 days. Weaning time, the duration of p.o. ileus, incidence and time to
resolution of VAP, glycemic level and the percentage decrease of CRP at
96 hours were assessed in both groups.

Results Weaning time and the duration of p.o. ileus were significantly
lower in Group A; although the incidence of VAP is similar in both
groups, the time of VAP resolution is lower, the glycemic control is
better in Group A. The percentage of CRP decrease is higher in Group
A. See Figure 1.

Conclusion Glutamine becomes an essential amino acid in severe
thoracic trauma and when the patients are fed other than TPN (enteral,
oral); although hard evidence is lacking, both administration routes
may be efficient as soon as possible.

reduction of morbidity and mortality in postoperative patients. The
n-6:n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio in parenteral nutrition
(PN) also influences the immune modulation. The aim of this study
was to evaluate the optimal ratio of PUFA in postoperative patients
following abdominal surgery.

Methods In a prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative,
multicenter, phase 3 clinical study, we compared the safety and
efficacy of a 2.1:1 ratio of n-6:n-3 fatty acid compared with 2.5:1 in
postoperative patients requiring PN. Fifty-four patients were assigned
to receive PN with Combiflex Omega peripheral® (CFO, low ratio group,
n = 28) or SMOFKabiven peripheral® (KAB, high ratio group, n = 26) for
3 days after abdominal surgery. Safety and efficacy were monitored
daily with laboratory parameters, vital signs, and adverse events from
the operation day (day 0) until the end of the study (day 4).

Results Total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol
(LDL-C) levels were less changed significantly in the low ratio group
(3 + 18 vs. 16 + 23 mg/dl, P = 0.027 for TC, 4 + 12 vs. 12 + 18 mg/dl,
P=0.026 for LDL-C) compared with the high ratio group in postoperative
patients. Other laboratory parameters and adverse events did not show
statistically significant differences between the groups. See Table 1.

Influence of fat-based versus glucose-based enteral nutrition
formulas on glucose homeostasis

M Wewalka, A Drolz, C Zauner

Medical University of Vienna, Austria

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P250 (doi: 10.1186/cc12188)

Introduction Trauma patients who receive fat-based parenteral
nutrition (PEN) achieve better glucose control compared with those fed
with glucose-based PEN [1,2]. Therefore, we determined whether fat-
based enteral nutrition (EN) has the same benefit on glucose control
and exogenous insulin demand in medical intensive care patients
compared with glucose-based EN. Here we present preliminary data
for this ongoing randomized controlled cohort study.

Methods Medical critically ill patients with need for mechanical
ventilation and without contraindications for EN are included in the
study. Patients are randomly assigned to receive either fat-based
(n = 30) or glucose-based (n = 30) EN. To evaluate the individual calorie
demand, indirect calorimetry is performed after an overnight fast. The
determined amount of EN is administered continuously for 5 days.
Glucose concentrations are measured at least three times per day and
averaged. Furthermore, exogenous insulin demand per 24 hours and
calorie achievement per 24 hours are evaluated daily.

Results So far, 37 patients, 16 with fat-based, 21 with glucose-based EN
have been included in the study. Both groups had similar age (62 + 10
vs. 58 + 16 years, P= 0.44), body mass index (26.7 + 5.8 vs. 28.4 + 4.4 kg/
m?’, P = 0.302), SAPS Il score (62.4 + 12.7 vs. 64 + 12.3, P = 0.697),
and fasting plasma glucose (132 + 34 vs. 121 + 26 mg/dl, P = 0.269).
Furthermore, resting energy expenditure was similar in both groups
(1,522 + 365 vs. 1,573 + 313 kcal/day, P = 0.647). Throughout the entire
study period, average blood glucose, exogenous insulin demand,
and calorie achievements per day were similar between the groups
(day 1: gluc: 139 + 30 vs. 127 + 20 mg/dl, P = 0.143; ins: 27.8 + 28.4

S94

vs. 16.2 + 19.4 IE, P= 0.155; EN: 52.9 + 25.6 vs. 61.7 + 25%, P = 0.304;
day 3: gluc: 129 + 17 vs. 133 + 21 mg/dl, P = 0.578; ins: 35.1 + 30.9 vs.
32.3 + 30.5 IE, P= 0.802; EN: 78.3 + 28.9 vs. 83.4 + 29%, P = 0.617; day 5:
gluc: 124 + 16 vs. 132 + 17 mg/dl, P= 0.276; ins: 25.7 + 37 vs. 33 + 26.4
IE, P = 0.562; EN: 73.9 + 41.4 vs. 87.1 + 23%, P = 0.354). Interestingly,
the calorie achievement was not associated with insulin demand (day
1: R = 0.241, P = 0.156) or average blood glucose (day 1: R = 0.248,
P=0.14) throughout the study.

Conclusion Medical critically ill patients with fat-based or glucose-
based EN achieve similar glucose control. EN was not associated with
glucose concentrations or insulin demand.

Effect of hypocaloric versus normocaloric parenteral nutrition on
whole body protein kinetics in critically ill neurosurgical patients
O Rooyackers, A Berg, J Wernerman

Karolinska Institutet and University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P251 (doi: 10.1186/cc12189)

Introduction The optimal feeding of critically ill patients treated in the
ICU is controversial. Present guidelines for protein feeding are based
on weak evidence obtained with suboptimal methods. Whole body
protein kinetics is an attractive technique to assess optimal protein
intake by measuring the effect of protein feeding strategies on protein
synthesis rates, protein degradation rates and protein balance. Here
protein kinetics were measured in critically ill neurosurgical patients
during hypocaloric and normocaloric parenteral nutrition.

Methods Neurosurgical patients on mechanical ventilation (n = 16)
were studied. Energy expenditure was measured with indirect
calorimetry. After that, the patients were randomized to receiving
24 hours of 50% of measured energy expenditure followed by 24 hours
of 100% or 100% before 50%. Whole body protein kinetics were
measured during the last half hour of the feeding periods using stable
isotope-labeled phenylalanine as a tracer. During a continuous infusion
of labeled phenylalanine and tyrosine, plasma samples were obtained
and later analyzed for the content of the labeled amino acids using
mass spectrometry. Protein kinetics were calculated using standard
steady-state kinetics. In addition, amino acid concentrations were
analyzed by HPLC. Student's t test was used for statistical analyses.
Results The patients received 0.5 + 0.1 and 1.1 + 0.2 g amino acids/
kg/day (P <0.001) on the days with 50 and 100% of measured energy
expenditure respectively. Energy expenditures were 23.4 + 2.7 and
24.5 + 2.3 kcal/kg/day (P = 0.05) on the 50 and 100% days respectively.
Plasma amino acids concentrations were 2.8 + 0.5 and 2.9 + 0.4 mM
(P = 0.085) on the 2 days respectively. Whole body protein synthesis
was 12% lower when 50% of energy expenditure was given, 11.7 + 3.0
versus 13.3 + 2.2 mg/kg/hour (P = 0.025), whilst protein degradation
was unaltered 13.6 + 3.5 versus 14.0 + 2.6 mg/kg/hour (P = 0.56). Also
protein oxidation was unaltered 3.0 + 2.1 versus 2.9 + 1.4 mg/kg/hour
(P = 0.85). This resulted in a 60% higher whole body protein balance
with the normocaloric nutrition, -1.9 + 2.1 versus —-0.7 + 1.3 mg/kg/
hour (P = 0.014).

Conclusion The protein kinetics measurements and the protocol used
were useful to assess the efficacy of nutritional support in critically ill
patients. In the critically ill neurosurgical patients treated in the ICU,
hypocaloric feeding was associated with a more negative protein
balance, while the amino acid oxidation was not different.

controlled trial (EPaNIC: clinicaltrials,gov: NCT00512122) [2] showed
that withholding parenteral nutrition during the first week of ICU stay
whereby tolerating substantial caloric deficit (late PN) accelerated
recovery and shortened weaning time as compared with early
parenteral substitution for deficient enteral feeding (early PN). We
examined the impact of late PN, as compared with early PN, on
incidence and recovery of ICUAW.

Methods A preplanned subanalysis of adult patients included in the
EPaNIC trial. The study was performed between October 2008 and
November 2010 and included those patients who required intensive
care for >8 days as well as a computer-generated, admission category-
matched, random sample of short-stay ICU patients, the latter to
correct for possible bias evoked by earlier ICU discharge in one of the
two study groups. Assessors blinded for treatment allocation evaluated
muscle strength clinically three times weekly from awakening onward
and performed nerve conduction studies and electromyography (NCS
and EMG) weekly. The primary outcome was the incidence of ICUAW,
diagnosed clinically by the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score
(<48/60) [3] at first evaluation. Secondary outcomes included ICUAW
at worst and last MRC evaluation, recovery from ICUAW and incidence
of abnormal findings on NCS and EMG. All analyses were performed
on the total dataset and on a for-baseline characteristics propensity
score-matched sample to correct for possible imbalances between the
groups.

Results Clinical ICUAW evaluation was performed in 600 patients
(matched n = 558), electrophysiological testing in 730 (matched
n = 684). Late PN reduced the incidence of ICUAW at first evaluation
from 43.1% to 34.4%, P = 0.03 (matched: early PN 41.6%, late PN 33.3%,
P = 0.04). Significantly fewer patients in the late PN group developed
weakness at any time during ICU stay (late PN 37.0%, early PN 46.4%,
P = 0.02; matched: late PN 36.2%, early PN 45.2%, P = 0.03). ICUAW
may have recovered faster with late PN than with early PN (P = 0.05,
matched P = 0.06). Other outcomes were not different.

Conclusion As compared with early PN, late PN reduced the incidence
of ICUAW and may have accelerated recovery thereof.

Introduction The goal of enhanced nutrition in critically ill patients is
to improve outcome by reducing lean tissue wasting. However, such
effect has not been proven. This study aimed to assess the effect of
early administration of parenteral nutrition (PN) on muscle volume and
composition by repeated quantitative computer tomography (qCT).

Methods We performed a preplanned substudy of a randomized
controlled trial (EPaNIC) that compared early initiation of PN
when enteral nutrition was insufficient (early PN) with tolerating a
pronounced nutritional deficit for 1 week in the ICU (late PN) [1]. Late
PN prevented infections and accelerated recovery. We studied 15
EPaNIC study neurosurgical patients requiring prescheduled repeated
follow-up CT scans and six healthy volunteers matched for age, gender
and BMI. Repeated abdominal and femoral qCT images were obtained
in a standardized manner on median ICU day 2 (IQR 2 to 3) and day 9
(8 to 10). Intramuscular, subcutaneous and visceral fat compartments
were delineated manually. Muscle and adipose tissue volume and
composition were quantified using standard Hounsfield Unit ranges.

Results Critical illness evoked substantial loss of femoral muscle volume
in 1 week, irrespective of the nutritional regimen. Early PN reduced the
quality of the muscle tissue, as reflected by the attenuation, revealing
increased intramuscular water/lipid content. Early PN also increased the
volume of adipose tissue islets within the femoral muscle compartment.
These changes in skeletal muscle integrity correlated with caloric

S95

intake. In the abdominal muscle compartments, changes were similar,
albeit smaller. Femoral and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue
compartments were unaffected by disease and nutritional strategy.
Conclusion Early PN did not prevent the pronounced wasting of
skeletal muscle observed over the first week of critical illness. Moreover,
early PN increased the amount of adipose tissue within the muscle
compartments.

Withholding parenteral nutrition during the first week of critical

Introduction Cholestatic liver dysfunction (CLD) during critical illness,
defined by hyperbilirubinemia, often occurs and is associated with
poor outcome. Parenteral nutrition (PN) is assumed to aggravate CLD.
However, hyperbilirubinemia more frequently occurred when the start
of PN was delayed until day 8 in the ICU (late PN) [1]. Late PN accelerated
recovery as compared with early initiation of PN.

Methods This was a preplanned subanalysis of a large randomized
controlled trial on early versus late initiation of PN (n = 4,640) [1]. Plasma
total bilirubin was quantified in all patients daily while in the ICU. Liver
enzymes ALT, AST, GGT and ALP were quantified twice weekly in all
patients while in the ICU. In a random predefined subset of patients,
circulating bile salts were also quantified with MS-HPLC at baseline
and on day 3, day 5 and the last day in the ICU (n = 280). Gallbladder
sludge was evaluated by ultrasound on ICU day 5 by blinded assessors
(n = 776).

Results From day 1 after randomization until the end of the 7-day
intervention window, plasma bilirubin was higher in the late PN than
in the early PN group (all P <0.001). In the late PN group, as soon as
PN was started on day 8, plasma bilirubin also fell and the two groups
became comparable. Maximum levels of GGT, ALP and ALT during the
ICU stay were higher in the early PN group (all P <0.01). Compared with
baseline, the circulating glycine and taurine conjugated primary bile
salts were elevated on day 3, day 5 and last day of the ICU stay (P <0.01
for all). However, there was no difference between the two groups.
More patients in the early PN than in the late PN group had gallbladder
sludge on day 5 (45% vs. 37%; P = 0.04).

Conclusion Tolerating substantial caloric deficit by withholding PN
until day 8 of critical illness increased circulating levels of bilirubin but
reduced the occurrence of gallbladder sludge and lowered GGT, ALP
and ALT levels. These results suggest that hyperbilirubinemia during
critical illness dies not necessarily reflect cholestasis and instead may
be an adaptive response. Additional analyses on a propensity score-
matched patient population are ongoing.

Impact of early parenteral nutrition on catabolism

Introduction Prolonged critically ill patients enter a state of
hypercatabolism and muscle weakness, which has been associated
with increased morbidity and mortality. Early, full feeding of ICU
patients has been advocated to counteract catabolism. However, a
large, multicenter study found that early parenteral nutrition (PN) had
no significant impact on mortality and even increased dependency
on intensive care with, among others, a significant prolongation of

----$$$$----$$$$----

the duration of renal replacement therapy (RRT) [1]. The impact of the
intervention on early markers of catabolism has not been investigated.
Methods We studied the impact of early versus late PN on daily
markers of catabolism in the ICU in the total study population and in
propensity score-matched subgroups of long-stay patients. In addition,
we calculated the net incorporation rate of the extra amino acids
supplied by early PN.

Results Plasma urea, the urea/creatinine ratio and nitrogen excretion
increased over time in the ICU. Early PN further increased these markers
of catabolism, from the first day of amino acid infusion onward, and
only marginally improved the nitrogen balance. Also in the group
that received PN only after the first week in the ICU, ureagenesis was
increased by infusing amino acids. Over the first 2 weeks, approximately
two-thirds of the extra amino acids supplied by early PN were net
wasted in urea. The above findings were confirmed in propensity score-
matched subgroups of long-stay patients. The higher urea levels with
early PN, rather than the kidney function as such, may have driven the
observed longer duration of RRT, as supported by multiple regression
analysis.

Conclusion The extra amino acids supplied by early PN appeared
inefficient to reverse the negative nitrogen balance, not because of
insufficient amino acid delivery, but rather because of insufficient
incorporation with, instead, increased degradation into urea. The
substantial catabolism of the extra amino acids, leading to pronounced
urea generation, may have prolonged the duration of RRT in the early
PN group.

Introduction Muscle weakness of critical illness is associated
with prolonged dependency on ventilatory support and delayed
rehabilitation. Muscle wasting related to poor nutrition has long been
considered a major determinant, whereas the importance of myofiber
integrity only recently emerged [1-4]. We hypothesized that nutrient
restriction early during illness aggravates atrophy while preserving
myofiber integrity by activating the crucial cellular quality control
pathway autophagy. The latter could be important to preserve muscle
function.

Methods Critically ill patients (n = 122) were randomized to early (early-
PN) or late (late-PN) initiation of parenteral nutrition to complete failing
enteral nutrition, while maintaining normoglycemia (80 to 110 mg/
dl) with insulin, in the EPaNIC study [5]. Vastus lateralis biopsies were
harvested after 1 week and compared with matched controls (n = 20).
Results As compared with controls, muscle from critically ill patients
showed reduced myofiber density, a shift to smaller (especially type 1)
myofibers, lower myosin and actin MRNA, upregulated MRNA of the
ubiquitin ligases muscle-ring-finger-1 and atrogin-1, a small increase
in the autophagosome formation marker LC3-II/LC3-l, and increases
in the autophagic substrates ubiquitin and p62 (all P <0.006). Late-PN,
resulting in a larger caloric deficit than early-PN, had no substantial
impact on atrophy markers. In contrast, late-PN increased LC3-II/LC3-|
(P = 0.02), which coincided with less accumulation of ubiquitinated
proteins/aggregates (P = 0.05). Fewer patients on late-PN developed
muscle weakness as compared with early-PN (42% vs. 68%, P = 0.05).
In multivariable analysis, a lower LC3-II/LC3-I ratio (P = 0.05) and higher
myofiber density (P = 0.04) were independently associated with muscle
weakness.

Conclusion Early-PN did not counteract muscle atrophy whereas
it suppressed autophagy and aggravated weakness. Statistically,
muscle weakness was not explained by atrophy or wasting but rather
by impaired autophagy and preservation of muscle density. Thus,
tolerating nutrient restriction early during critical illness may preserve
myofiber integrity by activating autophagy.

Impact of closing an emergency department on a neighbouring
teaching hospital: the concentrate effect

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P257 (doi: 10.1186/cc12195)

Introduction Closure of an acute hospitals emergency department
(ED) has important ramifications for those centres expected to take up
the resultant workload. The continued reconfiguration of emergency
care is likely to produce an increasing number of these scenarios. Little
evidence is available to support planning of such initiatives and thus the
implications are difficult to anticipate. This study aims to demonstrate
one hospital’s experience of the rationalisation of emergency care and
its effect on workload.

Methods This retrospective study was conducted in a large teaching
hospital. Activity data were analysed for a 12-month period following
the closure of a neighbouring ED. The results were subsequently
compared against the year prior to closure. Attendance, triage data,
admission rates and waiting times were compared across the two
periods, as were workload data for all grades of physician. The chi-
squared test was used to examine differences between groups.
Results In the period studied, the gross attendance figure increased
by 20,480 (33.72%), whilst the admission rate rose from 22 to 27%.
Following closure of the neighbouring ED, the proportion of high-
acuity patients attending our institution increased dramatically,
with the proportion of category one and two patients (Manchester
Triage Scale) increasing by 8.33% (P = 0.076) and 18.80% (P <0.001),
respectively. Likewise, ambulance arrivals increased out of proportion
to the total increase in attendances (P = 0.016). Admissions from the ED
to the ICU increased by 63.04%. Consultants workloads now include
50% more category 1 and 2 patients (P = 0.001).

Conclusion Reconfiguration of emergency care can have dramatic
implications for existing services; these may not always be anticipated.
Rationalisation of ED’s may result in a concentration of high-acuity
patients accompanied by a downturn in the numbers of patients
whose presentations are amenable to care delivered in other settings.
This abrupt change in case mix requires a re-examination of existing
workforces and their seniority.

Introduction Emergency department (ED) overcrowding is a major
international problem with a negative impact on both patient care and
providers. Among validated methods of measurement, emergency
physicians have to choose between simple and complex scores [1,2].
The aim of the present study was to compare the complex National
Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale (NEDOCS) with the
simple occupancy rate (OR) determination. We further evaluated the
correlation between these scores and a qualitative assessment of
crowding.

Methods The study was conducted in two academic hospitals and one
county hospital in Liege, Chénée and Verviers; each with an ED census
of over 40,000 patient visits per year. Samplings occurred over a 2-week
period in January 2011, with five sampling times each day.

Results ED staff considered overcrowding as a major concern in the
three EDs. Median OR ranged from 68 to 100, while the NEDOCS
ranged from 64.5 to 76.3. We found a significant correlation between

the OR and the NEDOCS (Pearson R = 0.973, 0.974 and 0.972), as well as

between the OR, the NEDOCS and the subjective evaluation (P = 0.001).

Conclusion Crowding evaluation in the ED requires validated, easy-to-

use, scores. Our study indicates that the simple OR is as accurate as the

complex NEDOCS, allowing continuous crowding assessment.

Introduction It is evident that accident and emergency departments
are overloaded with patients, which results in delays in healthcare
provision [1]. A large proportion of patients consist of patients with
minor illness that can be seen by a healthcare provider in a primary care
setting. The aim of the study was to determine the characteristics of
patients using GP walk-in services, patients’ satisfaction and the effect
on emergency department (ED) services.
Methods The survey was conducted in Sheffield and Rotherham
walk-in centres over 3 weeks during September and October 2011.
A self-reported, validated questionnaire was used to conduct survey
on the patients presenting at these centres. We estimated that a
sample size of around 400 patients from each centre was required to
achieve statistically robust results. A post-visit, short questionnaire
was also sent to those who agreed for the second questionnaire and
provided contact details. ED data were also obtained from April 2008
to March 2010, 1 year before and 1 year after the opening of the GP
walk-in centre. Data were entered and analysed in PASW Statistics 18.
Ethical approval of the study was obtained from the NHS ethical review
committee.
Results A total of 1,030 patients participated in the survey (Rotherham
501; Sheffield 529). The mean age of the participants was 32.1 years at
Sheffield and 30.88 years at Rotherham. A higher proportion of users
were female, around 59% at both centres. Most of the patients rated
high for convenience of the centre opening hours and location (above
85%, apart from the location of Sheffield centre, which was rated high
by around 72% of the research participants). Overall 93% patients
were satisfied with the service at Rotherham centre and around 86%
at the Sheffield centre. Based on the estimation of the monthly counts
of patients attending ED and the GP walk-in centre, around 14%
monthly reduction in minor attendances at ED was expected. However,
ED routine data did not show any significant reduction in minor
attendances as a result of the opening of the GP walk-in centre.
Conclusion These walk-in centres have been shown to increase
accessibility to healthcare service through longer opening hours and
walk-in facility. Although the effect on the reduction of patients’ load at
the ED is not visible as these centres cover a fraction of the population,
the centre has a potential to divert patients from the ED.

has a negative impact on patient safety [1]. The aim of this study was
to analyse whether a reform of emergency care can reduce patient flow
into the ED.

Methods A substantial reform of emergency care took place in the
province of Kanta-Hame in Southern Finland. Three separate out-of-
hours services in primary healthcare (PHC) and one ED in the hospital
were combined into one large ED in April 2007. Basic principles of
the new ED were: the ED is only for those patients who are seriously
ill or injured, and need immediate care; PHC (healthcare centres) take
care of acute ordinary illnesses and nonserious injuries during office
hours. To achieve these principles a regional five-scale triage system
was planned and implemented. The information plan was established.
Citizens were systematically informed about the principles of the new
ED by mail, articles in the newspapers and interviews in the radio and
television. The ED’s Internet pages were planned and established. The
number of patient visits (Hameenlinna region) was analyzed 2 years
before and after establishing the new ED.

Results During the 2-year period before the establishment of the
new ED the mean number of GP patient visits was 1,845 + 43/month.
During the 2-year period after the reform the number was diminished
to 1,364 + 21/month. This change was not associated with the increase
of the patient visits taken care of by specialists and hospital residents.
See Figure 1.

Conclusion An extensive reform of the emergency services can notably
reduce patient flow into the ED.

Introduction Rio de Janeiro’s Fire Squad is responsible for EMS in
the city. During 2010 we implemented 10 ambulances with EKG
transmission capability in our city. Our intention was to access the
prevalence of acute myocardial infarction in the prehospital setting.
Methods We used the Aerotel HeartView EKG system to acquire patient
examination and a blackberry phone to transmit and receive the PDF
EKG trace. The PDF comes with the cardiologist’s interpretation from a
remote hospital, the HCOR Sao Paulo.

Results We realized 503 EKG examinations in total. Of these, 248
(49%) had as the chief complaint chest pain, 101 (20%) shortness of
breath, 47 (9%) syncope, 36 (7%) palpitation; other complaints were
15%. We detected 32 examinations (6.36%) with ST elevation MI and

44 examinations (8.75%) with ST depression. Atrial fibrillation was

detected in 43 examinations (8.5%). See Figures 1 and 2.

Conclusion This experience gave us an idea of the prevalence for

acute ST elevation MI in the prehospital setting, so that we can better

develop our prehospital thrombolysis protocol and focus our training

for cardiology care.

Technique of ultrasound-guided peripheral venous access in the
emergency room

MG Annetta, G Scoppettuolo, M Biancone, F Toni, M Pittiruti

Catholic University, Rome, Italy

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P262 (doi: 10.1186/cc12200)

Introduction In emergency situations, patients may need a fast and
reliable peripheral venous access, which sometimes may be difficult
to obtain, because of poor visualization of the superficial veins due
to edema, obesity, hypovolemia or local abnormalities. In such cases,
insertion of a central line is potentially time consuming and possibly
associated with complications. Furthermore, central lines inserted
in emergency are known to be at high risk of infection, so guidelines
recommend that they should removed within 24 to 48 hours. In this
setting, ultrasound-guided placement of a peripheral venous access
might be more rapid, safer and more cost-effective than a central line.
Methods We have reviewed retrospectively our experience with the
emergency use of 18 Gor 20 G polyurethane catheters, 8 to 10 cm long,
inserted by direct Seldinger technique.

Results In 1 year, 76 long peripheral catheters were inserted in
emergency conditions, using ultrasound guidance. The success rate
was 100%; most lines lasted >1 week and were used for different
purposes, including contrast medium injection.

Conclusion The direct Seldinger technique allows a rapid and safe
placement of the catheter in a vein of the arm or of the forearm,
even when the vessel cannot be palpated or seen, as long as it can
be visualized by ultrasound and it is not deeper than 2 cm. The long
life of this type of peripheral line (up to 2 weeks) is guaranteed by the
material (polyurethane being more biocompatible than Teflon) and
by the length of the catheter (which reduces the risk of dislodgment).
Also, these catheters are particularly cost-effective if compared with a
central line or with a midline catheter, since a complete kit including
catheter, 20 G needle and 20 cm guidewire costs between €15 and €20.

University Hospital, Birmingham, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P263 (doi: 10.1186/cc12201)

Introduction The lumbar plexus block provides excellent analgesia
after hip and knee surgery. One approach to the three major nerves
(femoral, lateral cutaneous and obturator) of the lubar plexus is
the fascia iliaca compartment block, first described by Dalens and
colleagues. Using this blind approach, complete nerve block in the
distribution of the lumbar plexus may be achieved only in 38% of cases.
Ultrasound-guided regional techniques offer a number of advantages
including real-time needle guidance and direct observation of local
anesthetic spread within tissue planes.

Methods We hypothesized that real-time UFIB could be successfully
performed in the ED and would provide an excellent adjunct or
alternative to repeat doses of IVMS for pain control in patients with HFx.
The study was conducted at University Hospital, Birmingham, where
we see about 90,000 patients every year. All patients with confirmed
femoral (neck/shaft) fractures and pain score >7 were included in
the study. Patients with local wounds, or suspected significant pelvic
injury were excluded. A combination of 15 ml lignocaine 1% and 15 ml
bupvivcaine 0.25% was used. VAS (0 to 10), pain on movement of the

S99

leg and patient satisfaction were used to assess the outcome. The
assessments were made before the FIB, at 15 minutes, 30 minutes and
45 minutes.

Results A convenience sample of 19 patients was enrolled in this study.
The compartment block was placed by three mergence ultrasound
trainers. The mean age was 58.5 years. There were 13 females and
six males. The mean pain score was 9.5 at time 0. The mean pain
score had improved to 5.5 at 15 minutes, 4.5 at 30 minutes and 3 at
45 minutes, respectively. The patient satisfaction was scored 4.5 on a
scale of 1 to 5 where 5 was the most satisfied. No patient required any
further analgesia up to 90 minutes and no issues were raised about
the pain or discomfort upon patient transfer. We have no documented
complications or side effects.

Conclusion FIB is now widely used by non-anaesthetic trainees to
combat pain in preoperative care due to its safe landmarks. Our
results have shown that it can be used safely and effectively for pain
management in hip fracture by emergency physicians, who are trained
in the technique, on the shop floor.

Abdominal pain in adolescent females: a single-centre audit and
review of management

F Gallagher, H Jahn, F Davies

Leicester Royal Infirmary, Leicester, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P264 (doi: 10.1186/cc12202)

Introduction Abdominal pain in adolescent females has undergone
recent changes with regards to its management under various
specialities. The authors report a single-centre audit looking at the
correct investigation and management of 12-year-old to 16-year-old
girls with abdominal pain in the emergency department setting.
Methods A single-centre audit and retrospective analysis of patients
took place using case notes and computerised records. Documentation
was analysed using statistical analysis and minimum standards were
set and reviewed.

Results After exclusion criteria 62 females between the ages of 12 and
16 presented to the paediatric emergency department in Leicester
with abdominal pain as the predominant admission symptom during
a 12-month period. Documentation of the gynaecological history
was poor (menstrual history 47%, sexual history 14%, contraception
8%), as was the performance of basic investigations (urine dipsticks
65%, pregnancy test 42%). Documentation was analysed with regard
to discharge diagnosis. Ultrasound investigation was performed on
seven of the patients but only once admitted to various specialities. No
ultrasound was undertaken upon admission.

Conclusion Improvement in documentation of minimum standards
for these patients is needed. A multidisciplinary care pathway could
improve outcome. Consideration should be given to whether early
ultrasound investigation is appropriate and there is a further need for
investigation as to whether this would improve longer term outcomes.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P265 (doi: 10.1186/cc12203)

Introduction This study aimed to implement a multidisciplinary
quality improvement project in Perth Royal Infirmary A&E department
to improve documentation of visual acuity (VA) in patients presenting
with ocular injury.

Methods The improvement project involves a three-pronged multi-
disciplinary approach: ensure that equipment required for VA testing
(Snellen chart and pinhole mask) was readily available; encourage VA
testing at first point of contact with A&E staff, both nursing/medical staff;
and refresher online course on how to test for VA quickly and accurately,
in the 6/X format. We compared the pre-intervention (2 September to
2 October 2012) and post-intervention (11 October to 19 November
2012) rates of VA documentation using the chi-square test.

Results During the pre-intervention period, of a total of 44 patients
who presented to A&E with eye injury, only 36 patients (95%) had their
VA tested. Following intervention, there was significant improvement
in VA testing, where all 43 patients presenting to A&E with eye injuries
had their VA tested (100%, P= 0.02). Documentation of VA in the correct
(6/X) format increased from 82 to 84% following intervention. There
was a 15% improvement in documentation of best-corrected VA, from
48 to 63% post intervention. See Figure 1.

Conclusion Through a multidisciplinary approach, we were successful
in achieving our target of 100% VA documentation rate in all patients
presenting with eye injury to PRI A&E.

BiPAP for treating moderate and severe asthma exacerbations in a
PED

A Williams, T Abramo

Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P266 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12204)

Introduction BiPAP utilization for the treatment of severe refractory
status asthmaticus patients has become an accepted therapy but is
not well described for moderate exacerbations. We sought to analyze
outcomes from our BiPAP quality database for children presenting in
status asthmaticus at varying levels of severity.

Methods PED status asthmaticus patients requiring BiPAP from
1 January 2010 to 31 August 2012 had a bedside interview and
documentation of information at the time therapies were given.
Incomplete data were collected retrospectively. All data were stored
and analyzed using a RedCap database. Subjects were stratified into
severity groups based on asthma score at the time of BiPAP placement.
Results There were 206 subjects in the moderate severity group
and 197 in the severe group. Table 1 shows the groups were well

placement. More of the severe group was admitted to the PICU and
had overall longer hospitalizations (P <0.06). None experienced severe

Conclusion BiPAP is a beneficial therapy for children presenting to
the PED with severe asthma exacerbations. It may have utility for less
severe asthma exacerbations.

Report of an outbreak of toxicity from a novel drug of abuse in the
UK: Eric-3

C Morden, S Haig, C Kelly

Great Western Hospital, Swindon, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P267 (doi: 10.1186/cc12205)

Introduction We present a case series of toxicity due to a novel sub-
stance in the UK: Eric-3. Novel drugs of abuse are becoming more
common throughout the world, and they represent particular
difficulties in their acute management. A recent report from the
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and
Europol has reported 49 new psychoactive substances reported via its
early warning system.

Methods This was a retrospective case-note review over a 6-month
period. Patients were included if their presentation was due to recent
ingestion of Eric-3. Physiological data, symptoms, outcome and
destination of the patient from the emergency department were
collected. Postmortem toxicological analysis was obtained for one of
the two patients who died.

Results Forty-one attendances were identified from 18 patients.
Two patients died and five were admitted to the ICU. Heart rate and
temperature on arrival tended to be above normal (mean heart rate
was 112 bpm, with an SD of 18; mean temperature was 37.45°C with an
SD of 0.95). In total, 63.4% of attendances included agitation and 34.1%
choreiform movements. a-Methyltryptamine and 3-/4-fluoroephedrine
were found in the blood of one of the patients who died.

Conclusion In this outbreak in the UK, Eric-3 gave symptoms similar
to other stimulants known as legal highs, including death. It may have
been a novel substance, 3-/4-fluoroephedrine. This underlines the need
for prospective data collection and early national and international
information sharing.

Introduction Thallium is an odorless, tasteless, heavy metal that has
been often used for intentional poisonings. In severe patients, thallium
poisoning produces neuromuscular symptoms such as extreme pain
and muscle weakness.
Methods Five case reports.
Results All patients worked at a pharmaceutical factory. They joined
a tea party held at their workplace at the end of April 2011. The five
patients drank tea from a teapot someone had put thallium in. A few
days later, they complained of femoral numbness and pain caused by
pressure. About a week later, three of five patients had profound hair
loss. Three weeks after the party, they came to our ER. We thought that
their symptoms might be caused by some chemicals. We searched the
keywords: ‘lower extremity pain; ‘hair loss’ and ‘poison’ in the Internet.
As a result, thallium, mercury, lead, and so forth, were suspicious
metals. In those metals, thallium was most likely because it was used
in their factory. We immediately examined the blood concentration of
several metals and ordered iron(IIl)hexacyanoferrate(II) that is known
as the antidote for thallium poisoning. Only thallium was positive in
the blood metal concentration test. Three patients consented to oral
administration of an antidote. Two patients rejected administration
because their symptoms were mild and getting better. All symptoms of
all patients gradually disappeared by August. We also followed up the
course of blood concentration of thallium. The concentration in three
patients who took the antidote was reduced more rapidly than the two
patients who did not take it.
Conclusion All patients recovered without any sequelae. Three patients
hair started to grow 3 months from ingestion of thallium, and after half
a year their hair was restored to their former state. We had difficulty
ordering iron(IIl)hexacyanoferrate(II) because this is also known as an
antidote for cesium. On 11 March 2011 a megathrust earthquake and
tsunami hit Japan and the giant tsunami gave rise to an accident at
a nuclear power generation plant. Because the rumor of radioactive
substances including cesium might be spread was the talk in the city
near the nuclear power plant, the authorities put the antidote under
heavy supervision. We could also collect the data for the course of
thallium concentration. Thallium concentration of the patients who
had an antidote was reduced more rapidly but these patients had a
loose stool, thought to be a side effect of this antidote.

Introduction Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) intoxication is among the
most common causes of poisonings in our country. The TCA group of

----$$$$----$$$$----

drugs affects the central nervous and cardiovascular systems, resulting
in severe arrhythmia and death. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is a
non-invasive assessment method that allows evaluation of the cardiac
autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) activity. The aim of this
study was to evaluate HRV in children requiring ICU stay due to TCA
poisoning.

Methods Twenty children with isolated TCA poisoning aged between 3
and 16 years who were hospitalized in the pediatric ICU, between March
2009 and July 2010, and 20 healthy children as a control group were
enrolled. Clinical and electrocardiographic (ECG) findings were noted
in the TCA poisoning group. In both groups, 24-hour time domain
HRV analysis (SDNN, SDANN, SDNNi, RMSDD, NN50, and pNN50) was
performed. We also recorded frequency domain analysis results at the
first 5 minutes and the last 5 minutes of the 24-hour record (VLF, nLF,
nHF, LF/HF ratio).

Results The average level of TCA in the study group was 1,116 + 635
and TCA levels were positively correlated with the duration of QRS
interval (P <0.01). In time-domain nonspectral evaluation, SDNN
(P <0.001), SDNN (P <0.05), RMSDD (P <0.01), and pNN5O (P <0.01)
were found significantly lower in the TCA intoxication group compared
with the control group, while NN50 (P <0.01) was significantly higher
in value. The spectral analysis (frequency domain) of data recorded at
first 5 minutes after intensive care admission showed that the values of
the nLF (P <0.05) and LF/HF ratio (P = 0.001) were significantly higher
in the TCA intoxication group than the controls, while nHF (P = 0.001)
values were significantly lower. The frequency domain spectral analysis
of data recorded at the last 5 minutes showed a lower nHF (P = 0.001)
in the TCA intoxication group than the controls, and the LF/HF ratio
was significantly higher (P <0.05) in the intoxication group. SDNN
(P <0.001), RMSDD (P <0.01), SDNNi (P <0.01), and pNN50 (P <0.01)
levels were higher in patients with positive ECG findings than those
without positive ECG findings. The LF/HF ratio was higher in seven
children with seizures (P <0.001).

Conclusion Existing findings give us an idea about HRV’s value to
determine arrhythmia and predict convulsion risk in TCA poisonings.
HRV can be used as a non-invasive method in determining the
treatment and prognosis of TCA poisoning.

St. Luke’s International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P271 (doi: 10.1186/cc12209)

Introduction Humans can be incidentally parasitized by third-stage
Anisakis larvae after ingestion of raw or undercooked seafood.
Although the clinical symptom of anisakiasis is abdominal pain, the
clinical finding is nonspecific and may be misdiagnosed as appendicitis,
ileus, and so forth. Every year, >40,000 patients visit our ED and our
hospital near the Tsukiji market (famous seafood market in Tokyo). We
often observed cases of anisakiasis in patients who visited the hospital
with abdominal pain as the chief complaint. Thus, we researched to
determine factors useful to diagnose anisakiasis.

Methods We retrospectively reviewed data of 83 patients (58 men,
25 women) diagnosed with anisakiasis in our ED (22 July 2003 to 22
July 2012) and examined the usefulness of clinical history, blood test,
diagnostic imaging, and so forth, for anisakiasis diagnosis. Diagnosis
was made after (A) endoscopically proven Anisakis polypide and (B) a
hematologically positive Anisakis antibody (IgG, IgA) and CT diagnostic
imaging.

Results Of the 83 patients, 39 had gastric anisakiasis and 44 had small
intestinal anisakiasis. All gastric and small intestinal anisakiasis patients
were diagnosed by methods A and B, respectively. A blood test was
unable to show the specific inflammatory reaction. A history of raw
or undercooked seafood ingestion was noted in 95.2% (79/83) of the
patients. This was observed in 100% (39/39) of the gastric anisakiasis
patients and 91% (40/44) of the small intestinal anisakiasis patients.
With regard to the development of symptoms, symptoms for gastric
anisakiasis developed within 48 hours and reached a peak in less than
6 hours, whereas the symptoms for small intestinal anisakiasis reached
a peak in 48 hours and persisted for a maximum of 5 days. Diagnostic
CT imaging revealed that all the patients with gastric anisakiasis

$102

demonstrated edematous wall thickening of gastric mucosa, and
ascites was observed in 44.4% (12/27) of these patients. The patients
with small intestinal anisakiasis demonstrated limited edematous wall
thickening of the intestinal tract, and ascites was observed in 90.9%
(40/44) of these patients. Furthermore, phlegmon of mesentery fat was
observed in 72.7% (32/44) of the small intestinal anisakiasis patients.
Conclusion When the cause of abdominal pain cannot be determined
by initial assessment, anisakiasis should be considered, especially if the
patient has a history of raw or undercooked seafood ingestion. In the
ED, certain methods of diagnosis are evaluation of the time to develop
symptoms and CT imaging, and a history of raw or undercooked
seafood ingestion should be considered in the diagnosis.

Introduction Sepsis has highincidence around the world, approximately
400,000 new cases occur annually in Brazil. In developing countries
it is still an important cause of death due to poor adherence to best
practice medicine protocols, mainly in community hospitals. The
Brazilian mortality rate of septic shock is around 60%. The aim of this
study is to describe the first Brazilian initiative of implementation of a
Telemedicine (TM) Project for therapeutic support of septic patients in
a community hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Methods Since May 2012, a TM Program has been implemented at
two hospitals in Sao Paulo — Hospital Municipal Dr. Moysés Deutsch
(HMMD), a public, secondary hospital, and Hospital Israelita Albert
Einstein (HIAE), a tertiary private philanthropic entity - due to a
partnership with Brazilian Health Ministry. A TM Central Command
was located at HIAE with Endpoint 97 MXP Cisco® Solution and a
mobile Intern MXP ISDN/IP Cisco® for the remote hospital (HMMD) via
dedicated GB/sec connection. Imaging examinations were evaluated
using PACS technology. At HMMD, the Sepsis Protocol, based on the
Surviving Sepsis Campaign, was started for every recruited patient
admitted to the emergency department (ED) or the ICU, and assessed
by the Central Command through TM with an experienced consultant.
Results Over a 6-month period, 33 patients with diagnosis of sepsis
(including severe sepsis and septic shock) admitted to HMMD were
evaluated by skilled doctors of HIAE via TM, and the Surviving Sepsis
Campaign protocol was instituted. In total, 87.8% of the consultations
originated from the ICU and 12.2% from the ED; 16 patients were
male (48.4%), mean age was 44.2 years old. TM improved diagnosis in
12.1% and influenced clinical management in 87.9% of the cases; in
11 patients (33.3%) TM consultation led to antibiotic change. Hospital
mortality rate was 33.3%.
Conclusion The implementation of the TM Project at a community
hospital has a major impact in the elCU and eED Sepsis Management
Program, and improved compliance with recommended care bundles.

Introduction Stroke is the leading cause of death in Brazil, the number
of stroke patients receiving thrombolysis therapy in the developing
world is extremely low. Prehospital delay, financial constraints, and
lack of infrastructure are the main barriers for thrombolysis therapy in
developing countries. In this way, telemedicine (TM) allows knowledge
transfer of medical expertise to remote community hospitals, where
there is a shortage of specialized doctors. The aim of this study is
to describe the first Brazilian initiative of a Telestroke Program for
therapeutic support and monitoring cases of acute stroke, and venous
thrombolysis of eligible cases in a community hospital in Sao Paulo,
Brazil.

Methods Since May 2012 a TM Program has been implemented at
two hospitals in Sao Paulo — Hospital Municipal Dr. Moysés Deutsch
(HMMD), a public, secondary hospital, distant about 60 minutes
from the nearest tertiary center, and Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein
(HIAE), a tertiary private philanthropic entity - due to a partnership
with Brazilian Health Ministry. Patients admitted to the community
hospital’s emergency department with acute ischemic stroke as
possible diagnosis are submitted to brain imaging examinations,
and considered for remote consultation. ATM Central Command was
located at HIAE with Endpoint 97 MXP Cisco® Solution and a mobile
Intern MXP ISDN/IP Cisco® for the remote hospital (HMMD). Imaging
examinations were evaluated using PACS technology. At HIAE the
TM Center has skilled doctors, including neurologists, available for
consultation 24 hours, 7 days a week. They discussed the neurological
cases via TM, and selected stroke patients for intravenous thrombolysis
when timely (3 hours symptom onset).

Results HMMD receives an average of 30 cases of stroke monthly,
and thrombolysis did not occur before the implementation of the TM
Project, because of the lack of neurologists available to conduce the
cases. After implementation of the TM Program, six cases of ischemic
stroke were thrombolyzed with alteplase; only one case (16%)
progressed to death from septic shock, and one case (16%) presented
symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

Conclusion Thrombolysis in ischemic stroke reduces 30% the risk
of disability and 18% the mortality rate. This procedure has been
only feasible to be done in the community setting because of the
implementation of the TM Project, which permits the presence of a real
time consultation with a specialized neurological team from a tertiary
center.

Introduction Following patients referred by the French emergency
dispatching centre (SAMU 15) in different hospital services (emergency
or ICU) is not always easy. The purpose of this study was to analyze each
call arriving in the emergency dispatching centre, define resources for
transportation, the host hospital department, and analyze the short-
term outcome of these patients.

Methods We conducted a prospective, observational study, by
collecting all data recorded at the emergency dispatching centre
in a continuous 24-hour period. Each call creating a medical file
was included. We identified the type of call, various administrative
information, the purpose of call, resources triggered, medical advice,
hospital department admission, and clinical evolution.

Results A total of 877 patients were included; 67.80% calling from
home, 15.63% calling from a public place. Firemen ambulances were
sent in 38.89%, private ambulance in 24.65% and an emergency
medical ambulance (SMUR) in 11.23%. Simple medical advice without
transportation was given in 13.19% of cases. In total, 22.18% of patients
were entrusted to the family; 2.89% of patients refused transportation;
69.94% of triggered firemen ambulances were done by a centre 18
call, without any medical regulation by an emergency physician. A
total of 68.59% patients were referred to the emergency department,
1.2% in ICU, and 1.8% in cardiac ICU. In the emergency room, 50.78%
of patients received a simple medical consultation with biological

$103

analyses, and then returned home. In total, 25.50% of patients were
hospitalized in a medical or surgical department, and 12.42% in the
short-term hospitalised unit of the emergency department (stay
duration <24 hours). Some 5.10% of patients worsened and were
oriented in the ICU. A total 3.77% of patients in a cardiac ICU. In total,
73.84% of patients had stay duration less than 6 hours in the ED, 24.45%
<24 hours. Forty percent of patients supported by firemen and 54%
supported by private ambulance left the hospital after a single medical
consultation.

Conclusion Nearly 70% of patients calling the French emergency
medical dispatching centre are sent to hospital. Those transportations
are supported for two-thirds of cases by a private ambulance or
firemen ambulance. One out of two patients only receive a simple
medical consultation in the ED, and go back home. This may concur
to the deficiency of using general medicine in town. They prefer
using emergency services for free. Only one patient out of four was
hospitalized more than 24 hours.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P275 (doi: 10.1186/cc12213)

Introduction Early onset effective care in the emergency department
(ED) has been reported to have a great influence on the intensive care
patients’ morbidity and mortality [1]. Little is known about the influence
of the reorganisation of the ED on patient intake to the ICUs. The aim
of this study was to analyse monthly intake of patients from the ED
to the cardiac care unit (CCU) and ICU before and after the reform of
emergency services.

Methods In Kanta-Hame Central Hospital, a new ED started on 1 April
2007. Four older emergency rooms were combined into one bigger
emergency department and an observation ward was introduced
with continuous follow-up of vital signs. This study is a retrospective
analysis of the patient intake to the CCU and ICU 1 year before and after
the reorganisation. Using as data the Finnish Intensive Care Quality
Consortium (Intensium, Finland) database and the cardiac database
of the hospital, patient transfer from ED to the ICU and CCU was
collected and analysed. Monthly pre/post comparisons were carried
out statistically by a nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

Results The total decrease in monthly patient inflow from ED to the ICU
and CCU was 30.1% (P = 0.003); that is, from the mean of 47.7 + 8.2 to
33.3 + 8.3 patients (Figure 1). The 7.1% decrease in patients taken into
the ICU (12.9 + 4.1 to 12.0 + 4.6 patients) was not statistically significant.
However, the intake from the ED to the ICU decreased by 38.6% (from
34.8 + 6.5 to 21.3 + 5.1 patients) (P = 0.002).

Conclusion According to our results the reform of the ED may have a
significant role in the total inflow of patients to the CCU and ICU.

Introduction We intended to compare paediatric traumatic injuries
due to war and others related to civilian accidents (CA).

Methods We conducted an observational epidemiologic retrospective
study on paediatric cases (<18 years old) seen at the emergency room
of Kabul International Airport NATO role 3 medical treatment facility
between 2009 and 2012.

Results During 3 years, 341 children were admitted to the emergency
room (ER) with a mean age of 10 years (9.49 to 10.51). Eighty-eight
per cent of children (301) were traumatized, 39% of them (118) due to
war injuries (WI) and 61% (183) due to CA. Forty-three per cent of WI
(gunshot wound 34%, explosion 66%) but only 19% of injuries due to
CA (falls 24%, transport accidents 56%, burns 9%, penetrating injuries
9%, unknown cause 2%) involved polytraumas defined as a New Injury
Severity Score (NISS) >15 (P <0.001). Patients experiencing a traumatic
injury related to war had lower Paediatric Trauma Scores (PTS) than
those injured in a CA (PTS = 6.4 (5.7 to 7.0) vs. PTS = 9.0 (8.7 to 9.4)
respectively, P <0.00001), higher ISS (ISS = 16.7 (13.8 to 19.6) vs. ISS = 8.9
(7.5 to 10.2) respectively, P <0.00001), NISS (P <0.0001), mortality rate
predicted by the Trauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS, P <0.02) or A
Severity Characterization of Traumas (ASCOT, P <0.001). The result is
longer overall hospitalization of patients having WI (P < 0.001) and a
higher number of surgeries (P <0.02). After the ER, 54% of patients with
WI were hospitalized in the ICU (86% of them after surgery) but only
26% of patients involved in a CA (71% after surgery). As many patients
with WI as involved in a CA (40%) were admitted to the ward (89% of
patients with WI after surgery but only 63% of patients with injuries
due to a CA). Thirty-three per cent of patients involved in a CA returned
home and one was transferred, whereas only three patients with WI
returned home after being in the ER, three patients were transferred
and one died in the operating room. Observed paediatric mortality in
our medical treatment facility was 2.9% (10 children out of 341): three
children died of WI, three due to a CA and one of septic shock due to a
medical cause.

Conclusion War injuries are more prone to cause polytrauma than CA.
According to the PTS, ISS, NISS, TRISS and ASCOT, children experiencing
WI have higher severity scores and predicted mortality rate than others,
stay longer in the hospital and have more surgeries.

Introduction There were several catastrophes in the last decades. The
make-up of systematic measuring and life-saving medical systems,
including intensive care, is thought to be an urgent and essential issue.
Our efforts for establishing a disaster medicine and education system
are presented.

Methods Mega-disasters or catastrophes are researched basically on
actual medical experience; that is, the 9/11 attack in 2001, Hurricane
Katrina in 2005, Indian Ocean earthquake with tsunami in 2004, the
Chernobyl incident in 1986 as well as the Higashinihon earthquakes
with tsunami, which was followed by the severest degree of nuclear
disaster in 2011.

Results Our research indicated that disaster medicine should be
established systematically or it is necessary to compile a compendium
of disaster medicine from a broad perspective or from a bird’s-eye and
long-term view. The Japanese version was tentatively completed with
22 volumes as of the financial year 2005, of which nearly three-quarters
are written in Japanese. Although this worked partly during the above-
shown catastrophe in Japan 2011, several problems are left to be
solved; that is, the insufficient operation system of the Japan DMAT or
Disaster Medical Assistant Team that seemed to have caused a large
number of preventable deaths.

Conclusion The large number of casualties during a major disaster is a
global problem, even in the developed countries. When the role of the
intensivist is reviewed, many roles were verified to be important; that
is, as a leader of a medical team or triage officer as well as a professional
in the field of specific intensive care. However, there are many problems
to be solved in the fields of disaster medicine. In order to solve the
diversification or the various medical problems, it is necessary to
compile or systematize a disaster medicine of the world version. The
concept of the compendium and our process of trial are shown in
relation to intensive care.

Australia

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P280 (doi: 10.1186/cc12218)

Introduction The study aimed to determine factors related to ICU

mortality in critically ill patients transferred by Adult Retrieval Victoria

(ARV) medical staff. Patients who died in the ICU after interhospital

transfer were compared with those who survived.

Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of ARV cases between

1 January 2009 and 30 June 2010. Retrieval data were linked with data

from the ANZICS CORE APD (Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care

Society Centre for Outcome and Resource Evaluation Adult Patient

Database). Victoria Data Linkage (VDL) performed linkage of the data.

Data included demographic and clinical data obtained during transfer

and data related to outcome measures in the ICU.

Results Of the 601 cases transferred by ARV during the study period,

549 were eligible for linkage to 25,543 ANZICS APD case records for

the same period. VDL matched 460 of these cases (83.8%). Logistic

regression analysis revealed the variables associated with mortality
were advanced age (OR = 1.02, 95% Cl = 1.00 to 1.04, P = 0.02), cardiac

principal referral problems (OR = 1.84, 95% Cl = 1.02 to 3.32, P = 0.04),

lower mean arterial blood pressure (OR = 0.97, 95% Cl = 0.95 to 0.99,

P= 0.005) and tachycardia (OR = 1.02, 95% Cl = 1.00 to 1.03, P = 0.008)

on arrival at the destination hospital.

Conclusion Advanced age, lower mean arterial blood pressure and

tachycardia towards the completion of transfer were associated with

increased ICU mortality in this population. Clinicians should be aware
of the additional risk for cardiac patients.

There are distinct differences in the pathophysiology between medical
cardiac arrests and TCA. Traumatic pathologies associated with an
improved chance of successful resuscitation include hypoxia, tension
pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade [1]. The authors believe a
separate algorithm is required for the management of out-of-hospital
TCA attended to by a highly trained physician and paramedic team.
Methods A suggested algorithm for TCA was developed based on the
Greater Sydney Area Helicopter Emergency Medical Service's standard
operating procedures and current available evidence.

Results An algorithm for the general management of TCA can be seen in
Figure 1. In TCA, priority should be given to catastrophic haemorrhage
control (tourniquets, direct pressure, haemostatic agents, pelvic
and long bone splintage) and volume resuscitation. Simultaneous
oxygenation optimisation should occur with proactive exclusion of
tension pneumothoraces with bilateral open thoracostomies. Cardiac
ultrasound (US) should be used to help exclude cardiac tamponade
and assist in prognostication. The US presence of true cardiac standstill
versus low pressure state/pseudo-PEA, and an ETCO, <1.3 kPa carries
a grave prognosis in TCA. Given the high incidence of hypovolaemia,
hypoxia and obstructive shock prior to TCA, the role of adrenaline and
chest compressions are limited. Figure 2 shows a suggested algorithm
for the management of penetrating TCA requiring prehospital
thoracotomy.

Conclusion The suggested algorithm is designed for a highly trained
physician-led prehospital team and aims to maximise the number of
neurologically intact survivors in out-of-hospital TCA.

Are physicians required during HEMS winch rescue missions?
PB Sherren, C Hayes-Bradley, C Reid, B Burns, K Habig

Greater Sydney Area HEMS, Sydney, Australia

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P282 (doi: 10.1186/cc12220)

Introduction A winch-capable helicopter emergency medical service
(HEMS) offers several advantages over standard rescue operations.
Little is known about the benefit of physician winching in addition
to a highly trained paramedic. We analysed the mission profiles and
interventions performed during rescues involving the winching of a
physician in the Greater Sydney Area HEMS (GSA-HEMS).

Methods All winch missions involving a physician from August 2009
to January 2012 were identified from the prospectively completed
GSA-HEMS electronic database. A structured case-sheet review
for a predetermined list of demographic data and physician-only
interventions (POI) was conducted.

Results We identified 130 missions involving the winching of a
physician, of which 120 case sheets were available for analysis. The
majority of patients were traumatically injured (90%) and male (85%)
with a median age of 37 years. Seven patients were pronounced life
extinct on the scene. A total of 63 POI were performed on 48 patients.
Administration of advanced analgesia was the most common POI
making up 68.3% of interventions. Patients with abnormal RTSc?
scores were more likely to receive a PO! when compared with those
with normal RTSc? (P = 0.03). The performance of POI had no effect
on median scene times (45 vs. 43 minutes; P = 0.51). See Tables 1
and 2.

Conclusion Our high POI rate of 40% coupled with long rescue times
and the occasional severe injuries supports the argument for winching
doctors. Not doing so would deny a significant proportion of patients
time-critical interventions, advanced analgesia and _ procedural
sedation.

Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2
http://ccforum.com/supplements/17/S2

Methods We maintain two identical sets of equipment (syringes,
fluid, airway management items, and so forth) and drug bags to take
on transfers; one equipment and one drug bag taken on each trip.
The contents of all four bags were checked and itemised. By careful
consideration of the aims of the bags (to provide emergency equipment
and drugs for managing one patient during an en-route emergency) a
new inventory was devised. Excess items were removed to lighten the
bags and improve accessibility to the essential items. Expired stock was
removed. A daily checking procedure and tamper-proof seals on the
bags were instigated and the bags were reassessed 12 months later.
Results A total of 13.9% of drug items and 29.2% of equipment items
had expired or would do so within 30 days of the initial assessment. The
combined weight of one equipment and one drug bag was reduced
from 14 to 9 kg (36% reduction) by introducing the new inventory. At
reassessment in November 2012, only 10 items of equipment (3.2%)
were expired or near to expiry and there were no expired drug items
(4.1% near to expiry). In total, 0.3 kg (26 small items) of extraneous
equipment had been added through over-restocking and was removed.
Conclusion These bags are designed for a clinician to manage a patient
when an emergency arises during transfer of a critical care patient. By
the introduction of simple measures, the risks posed by expired items
or cluttered equipment bags have almost been eradicated. Significant
weight savings have been made; this offers improved ergonomics
for staff and is also an important consideration for aeromedical
operations. Our department was surprised to discover the extent of
decline of our equipment and it may be that other departments would
find themselves in a similar position. The anaesthetic registrars who
routinely escort the transfer patients have a vested interest to maintain
this equipment and this has secured their buy-in to the new checking
procedure with clear results.

Safety standards for intrahospital transfer of critical care patients
D Ashton-Cleary

Royal Cornwall Hospital, Truro, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P284 (doi: 10.1186/cc12222)

Introduction The aim was to assess care of patients during intrahospital
transfer. The UK Royal College of Anaesthetists has defined auditable
standards for the care of patients and the training of escorting medical
and nursing staff in this context [1].

Methods Patients in a 27-bed combined general and neurosurgical
critical care unit were studied in January 2011 and May 2012. Patients
undergoing radiology department imaging or intervention were
identified from the electronic imaging library. Records of these transfers
were sought in the critical care electronic notes and the standards of
documentation graded on a five-point scale (very good, good, average,
minimal, absent). Documentation of the grade and training of escorting
staff was also sought. Between the two study periods, a transfer safety
checklist was introduced.

Results A total of 20.9% of 143 patients underwent one or more
transfers in January 2011 (40 transfers). In May 2012, 26.4% of 151
patients underwent 57 transfers. In the first period, documentation
was graded as minimal (limited to a statement that the patient had
left the critical care unit) or absent in 77.5% of transfers. In the 62.5%
of patients transferred whilst on invasive ventilation, 88.0% had no
documentation by the doctor and in 84.0% it was not known which
doctor had escorted the patient. There was only slight improvement
in the second period (71.9% minimal or absent documentation, 80.0%
no documentation by the doctor, 72.0% not known which doctor
escorted). In the documentation available, six severe complications
were noted during the second period (including episodes of severe
bradycardia, hypotension and pupil dilatation).

Conclusion On average our unit conducts nearly two critical care
transfers each day. Severe complications seem to complicate at least
10% of these, stressing the risk, need for good care and ongoing
training. The intervention made in this audit had little impact on the
standard of documentation. However, it has raised the issue within the
consciousness of the staff. It is important to identify interventions that
have failed to reach a gold standard to provide the impetus to seek
other solutions. As a result of this study, the author has devised new

$108

hospital protocols and specific training courses to improve standards

of transfer medicine locally. The study also identified our portable head

CT scanner to have the potential to reduce transfers by 52% and so this

has been strongly promoted.

Prehospital hyperoxemia does not influence the functional
neurological outcome in polytraumatized patients with traumatic
head injury

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P285 (doi: 10.1186/cc12223)

Introduction The association between hyperoxemia and neurological
outcome in trauma patients is not clear. We examined the association
between prehospital hyperoxemia and neurological outcome in
polytraumatized patients.
Methods This was a retrospective study of polytraumatized patients
with traumatic head injury who were endotracheal intubated and
ventilated with supplemental oxygen (100%) in the prehospital
emergency setting. Arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO,) was
measured after arrival at the hospital trauma center. We included
patients with initial PaO, above 160 mmHg (hyperoxemia group).
The severity of the trauma was determined upon the admission to
the hospital by the Injury Severity Scale (ISS) and the outcome was
assessed at the discharge from the hospital using the Glasgow Coma
Scale (GCS), Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and Cerebral Performance
Categories scale (CPC). Mann-Whitney’s test was used for data analysis.
Results Sixty patients were involved in the study. Forty-eight (80%) of
them were men and 86.7% sustained blunt trauma. Hyperoxemia was
present in 41.6% of patients. Initial average ISS was 38, in patients with
normoxemia 32.5 and in patients with hyperoxemia 35.4. Discharge
GCS, GOS and CPC in the hyperoxemia group compared with the
normoxemia group were 9.86 versus 9.33 (P = 0.503), 2.52 versus
2.24 (P = 0.613) and 3.10 versus 3.19 (P = 0.936) with the duration of
hospitalization of 26.64 days versus 27.72 days (P = 0.984).
Conclusion Prehospital hyperoxemia did not influence the functional
neurological outcome. One of the reasons for this finding could be
the short arrival time to the trauma center where repeated analyses of
arterial blood gases were performed. Therefore, correction of fraction
of inspired oxygen according to the arterial blood gas analysis shortens
the time of hyperoxemia, thus reducing neuronal brain damage.

Introduction The soluble form of urokinase-type plasminogen activator
(suPAR) has been identified as a marker for immune activation and is
demonstrated to accurately predict outcome in patients with sepsis or
infectious diseases. In multi-trauma patients a considerable immunological
response also occurs that is related to multiple organ failure and patient
outcome. We investigated the kinetics of suPAR, correlation with the
immune response and outcome in multi-trauma patients.

Methods Blood was obtained from adult multi-trauma patients (n = 63)
on arrival at the emergency room (ER) of the Radboud University

Nijmegen Medical Centre and days 1, 3,5, 7, 10 and 14 following trauma.
Plasma concentrations of TNFa, IL-6, IL-10, IFNy, IL-8 and MCP-1 were
determined by Luminex, and SuPAR concentrations using ELISA. Clinical
data were collected from electronic patient files. Concentrations, areas
under the curve (AUC) and regression coefficients were statistically
analyzed. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated and
differences between survival/nonsurvival groups were analyzed using
unpaired Student t tests.

Results SuPAR values at admission to the ER were higher in nonsurvivors
compared with survivors (n = 16, mean + SEM 4.1 + 0.6 ng/ml vs.n = 40,
3.0 + 0.2 ng/ml, P = 0.03). SUPAR levels increased in time. An increase of
suPAR did not predict or precede death, however. SUPAR AUC from ER
to day 5 tended to correlate with injury severity score (r= 0.5, P= 0.07).
Plasma cytokines in the ER did not correlate with suPAR measured at
the same time (for example, TNFa: r = 0.2, P = 0.37, IL-10: r = -0.02,
P = 0.91), while cytokine concentrations at the ER did correlate with
suPAR levels at days 3 (TNFa: r= 0.6, P <0.01, IL-10: r=0.5, P= 0.02) and
5 (TNFa: r= 0.7, P<0.01).

Conclusion Plasma concentrations of SUPAR measured at admission
to the ER are associated with overall survival of multi-trauma patients.
Furthermore, suPAR concentrations increased during hospital
admission, with most pronounced increases found in patients that
suffered more serious injury and related to the innate immune response
determined in the ER. These results indicate that suPAR is an innate
immune response-induced late mediator in multi-trauma patients.

Introduction Severe burn patients are often noted to have subsequent
neurocognitive problems. Experimentally, we have found striking,
prolonged elevations of inflammatory markers in the brain (for
example, IL-6) even when the injury occurs in a remote anatomic
location. This neuroinflammatory response can also be significantly
blunted by a single post-burn dose of estrogen. Sonic hedgehog (SHH),
an important signaling protein found in the brain, controls and directs
differentiation of neural stem cells, influencing brain regeneration and
repair by generating new neurons throughout life. As estrogens not
only blunt inflammation but also exert an influence on a variety of stem
cells, we hypothesized that 178-estradiol (E2) might affect levels of SHH
in the post-burn rat brain.

Methods Male rats (n = 44) were assigned randomly into three groups:
controls/no burn (n = 4); burn/placebo (n = 20); and burn/E2 (n = 20).
Burned rats received a 40% 3° TBSA dorsal burn, fluid resuscitation and
one dose of E2 or placebo (0.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) 15 minutes post
burn. Eight animals from each of the two burn groups (burn/placebo
and burn/E2) were sacrificed at 24 hours and at 7 days, respectively
(sham group at 7 days only), with four each of the two burn groups
sacrificed at 45 days. Brain tissue samples were analyzed by ELISA for
SHH.

Results Mean levels of SHH levels were significantly elevated within
24 hours as much as 45 days post injury in burned animals receiving
the 17B-estradiol (>1,200 pcg/mg) as compared with the placebo-
treated burned animals (<700 pg/mg) and controls (<300 pcg/mg). See
Figure 1.

Conclusion Early, single-dose estrogen administration following
severe burn injury significantly elevated levels of SHH in brain tissue.
This finding may represent an extremely novel and important pathway
for both neuroprotection and neuroregeneration in burn patients.

Introduction Many proposed resuscitative therapies for cardiac arrest
and trauma will require the earliest possible intervention and would
occur under volatile circumstances, making true informed consent for
clinical trials unfeasible. The purpose here was to report our experience
using exception to informed consent during the inaugural pilot study
of infusing estrogen for acute injury, the so-called RESCUE Shock study.
Methods Fifty patients were enrolled in RESCUE Shock in which
estrogen or placebo was infused as soon as possible in the emergency
department for trauma patients with a low systolic blood pressure
(<90 mmHg) at two level | trauma centers. They were all treated with
a single-dose estrogen or placebo infusion within 2 hours using
exception from informed consent following US federal guidelines.
Results Investigator-initiated exception from informed consent
studies is feasible, with our FDA IND approval obtained in 31 days,
IRB 1 approval in 25 days, and IRB 2 approval in 24 days. Community
consultation/notification was successfully accomplished with no one
opting out and 47/50 enrolled patients or their legal representatives
were notified of participation (one died unidentified, two died with no
known contact). The average number of days to verbal notification of
patients or advocates was 6.55 days (range 0 to 51 days) as the study
team began notification only after the patient or family was able to
reasonably understand information about the study. No one decided
against continued follow-up. Overall, patients and their families were
very enthusiastic about participation and the data safety monitoring
board had no safety concerns after reviewing all study data.
Conclusion Although delayed notice of participation occurs for many
justifiable reasons, the use of exception from informed consent for
novel, time-sensitive resuscitation studies is not only crucial, but
can be feasible, and well accepted by patients, their advocates and
communities at large.

models, accumulations of these cytokines have been observed in
remote organs, including the heart, brain and lungs. However, data
are lacking regarding the long-term levels of cytokines in the heart
following severe burn injury and also how infusion of parenteral
estrogen, a powerful anti-inflammatory agent, would affect these
levels. Using a rat model, we studied the effects of a full-thickness third-
degree burn on cardiac levels of IL-6 and TNFa over 45 days with and
without 178-estradiol infusion.

Methods A total of 168 male rats were assigned randomly to one of
three groups: (1) Sham burn (no actual injury) group (n = 8); (2) Placebo
(no treatment) burn group (n = 80); and (3) E2 (estrogen treatment)
burn group (n = 80). Groups 2 and 3 had 40% TBSA third-degree dorsal
burns, early fluid resuscitation and, 15 minutes post burn, 0.5 mg/kg
intraperitoneal estrogen (Group 3) or placebo (Group 2). From each
group of 80, eight animals were sequentially sacrificed (and cardiac
tissue was sampled for IL-6, TNFa, IL-18) at one of 10 respective time
points: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 18, 24 hours and day 7 post burn (at day 7 only
for the eight shams). The markers were measured by ELISA method.
Results In the burned rats, 178-estradiol significantly decreased the
cardiac levels of TNFa at all time points through 45 days post burn, with
the sham animal levels (30 pg/mg) more comparable with the estradiol
group (70 pg/mg), and significantly less than the placebo animals
(332 pg/mg). Similarly, IL-6 levels in the sham animals (70 pg/mg) were
comparable with the estradiol group (86.5 pg/mg), and significantly
less than the placebo group (730 pg/mg), even at 45 days post burn.
Conclusion Following severe burn injury in an animal model, an early
single dose of estrogen can decrease the prolonged let alone the early
onset of cardiac inflammation. Based on these data, clinical studies
of estrogen infusions should be seriously entertained as estrogen
may not only be an inexpensive, simple adjunctive therapy in burn
management, it may also obviate the need for many subsequent
interventions altogether and even diminish mortality.

Introduction Blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) is a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality. Rapid diagnosis and treatment with the
Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines are vital, leading to the
development of focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST).
Methods A retrospective study carried out from January 2007 to 2008
on all patients who presented with BAT and underwent FAST scan. All
patients subsequently had a CT scan within 2 hours of admission or a
laparotomy within 2 days. The presence of intraperitoneal free fluid was
interpreted as positive.
Results One hundred patients with BAT presented; 71 had complete
data. The accuracy of FAST in BAT was 59.2%; in these, 31 (43.7%) were
confirmed by CT and 11 (15%) by laparotomy. There were 29 (40.8%)
inaccurate FAST scans, all confirmed by CT. FAST had a specificity of
94.7% (95% Cl: 0.75 to 0.99) and sensitivity of 46.2% (95% Cl: 0.33 to
0.60). A positive predictive value of 0.96 (0.81 to 0.99) and negative
predictive value of 0.39 (0.26 to 0.54). Fisher’s exact test shows positive
FAST is significantly associated with intra-abdominal pathology
(P = 0.001). Cohen’s chance corrected agreement was 0.3. Twenty-
one out of 28 who underwent laparotomies had positive FAST results,
indicating accuracy of 75% (95% Cl: 57 to 87%).
Conclusion Patients with false negative scans requiring therapeutic
laparotomy is concerning. In unstable patients, FAST may help in
triaging and identifying those requiring laparotomy. Negative FAST
scans do not exclude abdominal injury. Further randomised control
trials are recommended if the role of FAST is to be better understood.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P291 (doi: 10.1186/cc12229)

Introduction The aim was estimation of the clinical and predictive
significance of the level of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) in
blood serum and examination of microbial landscape with account of
severity of sepsis syndromes in polytrauma.

Methods Clinical examination was performed, which included 99
patients with polytrauma according to sepsis syndrome: SIRS (n = 18),
local infection (n = 36), sepsis (n = 27), severe sepsis (n = 12), septic shock
(n = 6) to the criteria of ACCP/SCCM. The microorganism identification
was performed using iEMS Reader MF (Labsystems) with the La Chema
multimicrotests. The content of LBP in blood serum was assessed
with IMMULITE ONE (USA) with the reagents DPC (USA). Statistical
analysis of the data was performed with Statistica 6.0. The numerical
characteristics of variables are presented as Me (LQ to UQ). The analysis
of differences was carried with the Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple
comparison of independent groups, with Friedman one-way analysis
of variance. The differences were statistically significant with P <0.05.
Results In 81% of the critically ill patients with polytrauma the post-
traumatic period was accompanied with development of infectious
complications, Gram-negative (K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp.,
E.coli) and Gram-positive (S. Epidermidis, S. aureus). Sepsis was diagnosed
on 8 to 10 days in 45% of the patients. The significant increase of LPS-BP
was found in the first 3 days of the follow-up, compared with the control
values (6.7 times higher in SIRS group (x*(n = 18, df = 3) = 52.8666,
P <0.001); 9.9 times higher in the group with local infection (x?(n = 36,
df = 3) = 91.6629, P <0.001); 15.2 times higher in the sepsis group; 20.5
times higher in the severe sepsis group; 47.3 times higher in the septic
shock group (x(n = 6, df = 3) = 11.0339, P = 0.0115)), whereas the first
positive results of the microbiological examination were obtained only
on 5 to 7 days. The diagnostic sensitivity of threshold concentration of
LBP in blood serum (335 mkg/ml) was 84%, diagnostic specificity was
88% (ROC curve: 0.88).

Conclusion The high incidence of the diagnostic levels of LBP in blood
serum in patients with sepsis in the early term, before microbiological
confirmation of infection, allows one to use this parameter as an early
marker of development of purulent septic complications conditioned
by Gram-negative microflora.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P292 (doi: 10.1186/cc12230)

Introduction The aim of the study was to investigate the risk factors
for the development of complications following blunt chest trauma
and to develop a risk stratification tool to assist in the management of
this patient group. The difficulties in the management of this patient
group in the emergency department (ED) due to the development of
late complications are well recognised in the literature [1].

Methods Between 2009 and 2011 a total of 276 patients were admitted
to hospital from the ED of a regional trauma centre in Wales, with the
primary diagnosis of blunt chest trauma. Patients with immediate life-
threatening injuries were excluded. Data were collected retrospectively
and included risk factors (age, number of rib fractures, comorbidity,
pre-injury anticoagulant use, smoking status, oxygen saturations and
respiratory rate oninitialassessmentinthe ED), and outcomes (mortality,
any pulmonary morbidity, length of stay of 7 days or more and need
for ICU admission). Development of complications was defined as the
occurrence of one or more of the outcomes investigated. Multivariable
logistic regression using fractional polynomials was used to identify

risk factors and develop a risk stratification tool. The significant risk
factors in the model were selected using backward elimination with
the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) at a significance level of 0.05. The
cindex and the Hosmer—Lemeshow (H-L) test were calculated to assess
discrimination and calibration of the risk stratification tool respectively.
Results A total of 161 patients out of the 276 admitted developed
complications following blunt chest trauma. Implementation of
backward elimination using AIC values resulted in a final model based
on the significant risk factors; age, oxygen saturations, number of rib
fractures, presence of chronic lung disease and pre-injury anticoagulant
use (all P <0.05). The c index for the tool was 0.80 and the H-L score was
9.22 (P = 0.32), indicating good predictive capabilities of the tool.
Conclusion The results of this study highlight the risk factors for the
development of complications following blunt chest trauma. A risk
stratification tool has also been developed that could assist in the
prediction of poor outcomes in this patient group. The next stage is to
complete a prospective validation study.

Guidelines for chest drain insertion do not protect relevant
anatomical structures

'St Andrews University, St Andrews, Fife, UK; 7University of Salford, UK
Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P293 (doi: 10.1186/cc12231)

Introduction We have reported the risk of chest drain insertion inferior
to the diaphragm when using current international guidelines [1].
Another complication is damage to significant peripheral nerves,
such as the long thoracic nerve causing winging of the scapula [2].
We assessed these risks using: the European Trauma Course method, a
patient’s handbreadth below their axilla just anterior to the midaxillary
line; the British Thoracic Society safe triangle [3]; and the Advanced
Trauma Life Support (ATLS) course guidance [4].
Methods We used the above guidelines to place markers (representing
chest drains) in the thoracic wall of 16 cadavers bilaterally (32 sides),
1 cm anterior to the midaxillary line. Subsequent dissection identified
the course and termination of the long thoracic nerve, the site of lateral
cutaneous branches of intercostal nerves, and their relation to the
markers.
Results The long thoracic nerve was found in the fifth intercostal space
in 16 of 32 cases, always in or posterior to the midaxillary line. Contrary
to the description in Grays’ Anatomy (40th edition) it terminated before
the inferior border of serratus anterior. Most commonly it was found
to end by branching in the fourth (right) or fifth (left) intercostal space
(range third to sixth). Lateral cutaneous branches of intercostal nerves
were found in the fifth intercostal space in 25 of 32 cases. Contrary to
the description in Last’s Anatomy (12th edition) they always passed
anterior to the midaxillary line (and marker).
Conclusion Placement 1 cm anterior to the midaxillary line minimises
risk to the long thoracic nerve and lateral cutaneous branches of
intercostal nerves. We therefore conclude that not all areas of the British
Thoracic Society safe triangle are indeed safe, and anteroposterior
placement should follow the European Trauma Course and ATLS
guidelines: just anterior to the midaxillary line (for example, 1 cm).

Prediction score of indications for whole body computed
tomography in blunt trauma patients

H Oda, R Sasaki, A Hagiwara, A Kimura

National Center For Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan
Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P294 (doi: 10.1186/cc12232)

Introduction Whole body computed tomography (WBCT) appears to
be useful for the early detection of clinically occult injury, although its
indications have been controversial. The purpose of this study was to
develop a clinical prediction score to clarify the indications for blunt
trauma patients with multiple injuries (MI) who require WBCT.
Methods We conducted a retrospective study of 173 patients with
blunt trauma who underwent WBCT at our emergency center between
June 2011 and July 2012. We chose the presence or absence of MI
(Injury Severity Score =15) in need of surgical intervention as the
outcome variable. We used bivariate analyses to identify variables
potentially predicting the presentation of MI. The predictor variables
were confirmed by multivariate logistic regression analyses. We
assigned a score based on the corresponding coefficients.

Results Among the 173 patients enrolled, 53 were in the MI group. Four
predictors were found to be independently significant by the logistic
analysis: (1) body surface wound 23 regions, (2) positive focused
assessment with sonography for trauma, (3) white blood cell count
>11,000/ul, and (4) D-dimer =8 g/ml. Score 1 was assigned to predictor
(1), score 2 was assigned to predictors (2), (3) and (4). A prediction score
was calculated for each patient by adding these scores. The area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.89. No patients with a
score of 1 or less had MI (Figures 1 and 2).

Conclusion In patients with a score of 1 or 0, the presence of MI is less
likely. These patients may not require WBCT, and selective CT scans of
body parts based on clinical presentation should be considered.

Prehospital blood transfusion: 5-year experience of an Australian
helicopter emergency medical service

PB Sherren, B Burns

Greater Sydney Area HEMS, Sydney, Australia

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P295 (doi: 10.1186/cc12233)

Introduction There is an emerging body of evidence suggesting that
early packed red blood cell transfusion accompanied by fresh frozen
plasma, while limiting crystalloids, confers a survival benefit in major
trauma [1]. Prehospital blood transfusion has been infrequently
described, and concerns over expense, transfusion reactions, risk of
disease transmission, short shelf half-life and difficult storage have
limited the interest of prehospital providers.

Methods All Greater Sydney Area HEMS (GSA-HEMS) prehospital
missions involving a blood transfusion over a 66-month period were
identified and reviewed. The prospectively completed GSA-HEMS
electronic database was utilised to identify patients and extract data.
Results We identified 158 missions involving a prehospital blood
transfusion, of which 147 patient datasets were complete. The majority
of patients had a blunt mechanism of injury (93.9%) and were male
(69.3%) with a median (IQR) age of 34.5 (22 to 52) years (Table 1). The
majority of patients were haemodynamically unstable, with a median
(IQR) heart rate and systolic blood pressure of 115 (90 to 130) and 80
(65 to 105) mmHg, respectively. Twenty-two patients (15.0%) were
pronounced life extinct on the scene. A total of 382 units of packed
red blood cells were transfused, with a median of 3 units (range 1 to
6). No early transfusion reactions were noted. A variety of prehospital
interventions accompanied the transfusions, ranging from rapid
sequence intubation through to thoracotomies (Table 2).

Conclusion Despite the controversies over the role of fluids in the
prehospital environment, the carriage and use of blood is both feasible
and safe in a physician-led helicopter emergency medical service.

Severe hyperkalemia is prevalent and can be detected by
quantitative electrocardiographic findings and medication history
of calcium channel blocker among the patients with symptomatic
or extreme bradycardia

Kangwon National University Hospital, Chuncheon, South Korea

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P296 (doi: 10.1186/cc12234)

Introduction Severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium >6.0 mmol/l with
electrocardiography (ECG) change) should be detected and treated
immediately [1,2]. Among symptomatic or extreme bradycardia
patients, we sought its prevalence and prediction rule by history, vital
sign, and EGG [3,4].

Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed on
patients with symptomatic (heart rate (HR) <50/minute with dyspnea,
chest pain, altered mentality, dizziness/syncope/presyncope, general
weakness, oliguria, or shock) or extreme (HR <40/minute) bradycardia
at an ED of an academic hospital from June 2008 to March 2012.
Risk factors of severe hyperkalemia were chosen by multiple logistic
regression analysis among history (gender, age, comorbidity, and
current medication), vital sign, and ECG (maximal precordial T wave
amplitude, PR and QRS intervals). Scoring index was derived by
summing up of simplified regression coefficients of independent risk
factors.

Results A total of 169 cases were enrolled. Mean age was 71.2 years (SD,
12.5 years). Females numbered 87 (51.5%). Thirty-six cases (21.3%) had
severe hyperkalemia. Four variables were independent risk factors of
severe hyperkalemia (simplified scores in parentheses): medication of
calcium channel blocker (CCB: 2); maximal precordial T >8.5 mV (2); PR
(atrial fibrillation or junctional bradycardia: 1); and HR <40/minute (1).
(Nagelkerke R? = 0.503, AUC = 0.849 (95% Cl 0.786 to 0.899).) Sensitivity
and specificity reached 0.75 and 0.83 when total score was =3. For score
>4, positive likelihood ratio reached 5.54 (sensitivity 0.50, specificity
0.91).

Conclusion Severe hyperkalemia is prevalent among symptomatic or
extreme bradycardia patients and could be detected immediately by
a scoring index composed of quantitative ECG parameters and history
of medication of CCB.

Prehospital risk stratification following out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest

‘Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa, Japan; ?Yawata Medical Center,

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P297 (doi: 10.1186/cc12235)

Introduction Multivariate analyses have identified factors that have
enabled the development of sophisticated equations and scoring
models with the ability to predict outcomes following out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest (OHCA). However, implementation of such outcome
prediction models in research and clinical practice has been slow.
The more crucial aspect of these predictions is the lack of prehospital
risk stratification for OHCA patients. Prehospital risk stratification for
patients after OHCA may help clinicians guide in-hospital strategies,
particularly in the emergency department. The purpose of this study
was to develop a simple and generally applicable prehospital risk-
stratification scheme for patients after OHCA.

Methods We analyzed data for 390,226 adult patients (age =18 years)
after nontraumatic OHCA, from a prospectively recorded nationwide
Utstein-style Japanese database for 2005 to 2009. The endpoint was
1-month survival with favorable neurological outcome (Cerebral
Performance Category (CPC) 1 to 2).

Results Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated the following
three prehospital variables as significant high-ranking factors for
predicting favorable 1-month outcomes: shockable initial rhythm
(odds ratio (OR), 5.87; 95% Cl, 5.23 to 6.60), witnessed arrest (OR, 3.05;
95% Cl, 2.83 to 3.28), and age (=18 to <71 years; OR, 3.24; 95% Cl, 2.97
to 3.53). Using recursive partitioning analysis for development cohort
data (2005 to 2008, n = 307,896), we stratified prehospital risk: if OHCA
with shockable initial rhythm was witnessed, the probability of CPC 1 to
2 was 20.0% (age, =18 to <71 years; grade 1) or 10.3% (age, =71 years;
grade 2); if OHCA with shockable initial rhythm was unwitnessed, the
probability was 6.8% (age, <81 years; grade 3) or 1.8% (age, >81 years;
grade 4a); if OHCA with unshakable initial rhythm was witnessed, the
probability was 1.4% (grade 4b); and if OHCA with unshakable initial
rhythm was unwitnessed, the probability was 0.3% (grade 5). The
c-statistics for risk stratification of the development and validation
cohorts (2009 external data, n = 82,330) were 0.853 (95% Cl, 0.846 to
0.859) and 0.875 (95% Cl, 0.865 to 0.885), respectively. The odds ratios
for CPC 1 to 2 at 1 month between patients at very high and very low
were 79.5 (95% Cl, 72.5 to 87.4) and 122.1 (95% Cl, 102.0 to 147.3),
respectively, in these cohorts.

Conclusion Prehospital risk stratification (grade 1 to 5) of patients
after OHCA using three prehospital factors (shockable initial rhythm,
witnessed arrest, and age) accurately classifies the severity of OHCA
and may help clinicians guide in-hospital strategies.

Introduction In the last years, ICU admission has been high in
cancer patients due to increased survival related to advances in
treatment. Patients with cancer reportedly have poor outcomes from
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The goal of this study was to
evaluate the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary Medical Emergency
Team System in the CPR outcomes in cancer patients.

Methods We performed a prospective study between January 2011
and December 2012 at a university cancer reference hospital in
Brazil. Consecutive patients undergoing cardiac arrest and receiving
CPR were identified, and a database was used to register baseline
characteristics of patients, data for CPR and 30-day survival. During the
first 12 months of the study (phase 1), patients received CPR according
to the institution’s protocol guided by different physicians. During
the last 11 months of the study (phase 2), a multidisciplinary Medical
Emergency Team System consisting of a specialized team of ICU nurses,
physiotherapists and physicians using an electronic calling system was
responsible for the CPR.
Results A total of 182 patients experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest
and received CPR. Most patients were in hospital due to medical
admission (82%), had solid tumors (85%), and had localized disease
(60%). Pulseless electric activity was the predominant arrest rhythm
(54%) and 45% of patients were resuscitated on the ICU. Overall 30-day
survival was 9.3%. In the phase 1 of the study, 30-day survival was 3.7%,
and in phase 2, survival was 14% (P = 0.017). There were no differences
in the two phases of the study regarding baseline characteristics of
patients, rhythm and place of CPR.
Conclusion Overall survival from CPR in cancer patients compares
favorably with survival rates in noncancer patients. A multidisciplinary
Medical Emergency Team System increases survival in cancer patients
undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Focused cardiac ultrasound in resuscitation

E Fish, L Fuchs, G Gulati, D Talmor, A Oren-Grinberg

Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA
Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P299 (doi: 10.1186/cc12237)

Introduction Focused cardiac ultrasound is recognized as a vital tool
in critical care medicine. Few studies, however, have examined the
utility of this modality in resuscitation. While integration of ultrasound
can supplement resuscitation by potentially establishing the etiology
of cardiac arrest, it must be done safely to avoid interruption of
compressions. The aim of this study was to examine the integration of
focused cardiac ultrasound into resuscitations in our hospital.

Methods We performed a retrospective observational study of patients
undergoing resuscitation at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,
Boston, USA, from 2009 to 2012. Inclusion criteria were age >17 years

and performance of focused cardiac ultrasound during resuscitation.
Recorded variables included admission data, code demographics and
diagnosis, therapy outside standard ALS protocol, time to return of
spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and outcomes data.

Results Of 33 eligible patients, 12 were excluded due to incomplete cardiac
ultrasound reports; 21 patients were enrolled. Cohort demographics
included: 57.1% male, average age 64.3 years, average BMI 28.5 kg/
m?, average Charlson score 5.5. Resuscitations took place on the wards
(52.4%), ICU (42.9%), or operating room (4.8%). Most patients had an initial
unshockable rhythm (71.5%). The most common ultrasound finding was
cardiac standstill (47.6%) (Figure 1). The most common intervention as a
result of the ultrasound was initiation of a pressor infusion (33.3%), of which
71.4% were ionotropes. Additional therapies included blood transfusion
(4.8%), heparin (9.5%), tPA (4.8%), cardiac catheterization (4.8%), and
surgery (9.5%). ROSC was achieved in 37.5% of patients; average time to
ROSC was 13 minutes. A total 33.3% of patients who underwent ALS were
alive at hospital discharge and 28.6% at 1 year.

Conclusion Focused cardiac ultrasound is a feasible adjunct to ALS
resuscitation and may assist in the early identification of reversible
causes of cardiac arrest. Care must be taken to ensure no interruptions
to cardiac compressions are made by performance during pulse checks.
Further studies are needed to examine the outcomes associated with
its integration into resuscitations.

Acute intrathoracic gastric herniation as a rare cause of cardiac arrest
DW Hoelen, AL Van Duijn, CL Meuwese, JP Ruurda, MA Sikma

UMC Utrecht, the Netherlands

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P300 (doi: 10.1186/cc12238)

Introduction In this case report, we describe a patient who presented
with a cardiac arrest as a result of an obstructive shock, which
progressed into cardiac arrest, caused by an acute para-esophageal
gastric herniation.

Methods Our patient, with a medical history of a laparoscopic repair
of a symptomatic diaphragmatic hernia 6 months prior, presented
herself at the emergency department with pain in the upper abdomen
and nausea. The physical examination, laboratory tests and X-ray
of the thorax were normal and she was sent home. Twenty-four
hours later paramedics were summoned to our patient because of
increased complaints. On arrival of the paramedics she had a normal
electrocardiogram (ECG) and during the transfer from her bed to the
stretcher she collapsed due to pulseless electric activity (PEA), for which
cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started. Sinus rhythm and output
was regained after several minutes and the patient was transported to
the hospital. At arrival in the hospital, the X-ray of the thorax showed
an intrathoracic stomach and a significant mediastinal shift to the right.
Results After emergency laparotomy, which concerned correcting the
gastric herniation and resection of an ischemic part of stomach, the
patient remained hemodynamically stable. Cardiac ischemia was ruled
out based on EGG, laboratory findings, cardiac ultrasound and cardiac
computed tomography. The ultrasound in the emergency department
did show a distended right ventricle and normal left function, which
disappeared later (after repositioning the stomach), which is evidence
for the mediastinal shift as a cause for the PEA.

Conclusion We are the first to describe a patient requiring
cardiopulmonary resuscitation for progressive obstructive shock, due
to an intrathoracic stomach. Especially after a laparoscopic repair of a
diaphragmatic hernia, this is a rare cause for shock and cardiac arrest,
which requires a different medical approach.

Introduction Early bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
is a key factor in improving survival from out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest (OOH-CA). The ALERT algorithm, a simple and effective
compression-only telephone CPR protocol, has the potential to help
bystanders initiate CPR. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the
implementation of this protocol in the Liege dispatching centre.
Methods We designed a before-and-after study based on a 3-month
retrospective assessment of the adult victims of OOH-CA in 2009, before
the implementation of the ALERT protocol in the Liege dispatching
centre, and the prospective evaluation of the same 3-month period in
2011, immediately after the implementation of this protocol. Data were
extracted from ambulance, paramedical and medical intervention
teams files, as well as the audio recordings of the dispatching centre.
Results There were 233 OOH-CAs detected in the first period and 235
in the second. Victims were predominantly male (59%, both periods),
aged 66 and 64 years, respectively. Callers were family members in 52%
in 2009 and 64% in 2011. In 2009, only 9.9% victims benefited from
bystander CPR, while there were 22.5% in 2011 (P< 0.0002). Reasons for
protocol underuse were: assistance not offered (42.3%), caller remote
from the victim (20.6%) or emotionally distressed (15.5%). Mean no-
flow time decreased from 253 seconds in 2009 to 168 seconds in 2011
(NS). Ten victims were admitted in ROSC to hospital in 2009 and 13 in
2011 (P= 0.09).
Conclusion Using the ALERT protocol in the Liege dispatching centre
significantly improved the numbers of patients in whom bystander CPR
was attempted. Dispatchers must embrace this new opportunity to
help callers and be encouraged to accept the responsibility of initiating
such assistance.

Introduction Epinephrine has been a cornerstone of cardiac
resuscitation and advanced cardiac life support since the 1960s.
However, there is little evidence from clinical trials that epinephrine
administration after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) improves
long-term survival. There would be subsets of patients for whom
epinephrine administration is in fact beneficial. Our objective was to
determine whether prehospital epinephrine administration would
improve survival at 1 month in OHCA patients with unshockable initial
rhythm.

Methods We analyzed data for 383,045 adult OHCA patients with
unshockable initial rhythm, from a prospectively recorded nationwide
Utstein-style Japanese database for 2007 to 2010. We divided these
patients into two cohorts: prehospital epinephrine administration
cohort (n = 30,237) and non-epinephrine administration cohort
(n = 352,808). The endpoints were 1-month survival after OHCA,
prehospital return of spontaneous circulations (ROSCs), and 1-month
survival with favorable neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance
Category (CPC) scale, categories 1 to 2) at 1 month.

Results The rate of 1-month survival was 3.72% for the epinephrine
administration cohort and 2.49% for the non-epinephrine adminis-
tration cohort, 17.9% versus 3.0% for prehospital ROSC, and 0.57%
versus 0.77% for CPC 1 to 2 (all P <0.0001). Positive associations were
observed between epinephrine administration and 1-month survival
(adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.18; 95% Cl, 1.11 to 1.27), and prehospital
ROSC (aOR, 5.50; 95% Cl, 5.29 to 5.72; all P<0.0001). Negative association
was observed between epinephrine administration and CPC 1 to 2
(aOR, 0.56; 95% Cl, 0.48 to 0.66; P <0.0001). Multivariate logistic analysis
revealed that age (<66 years; aOR, 4.31; 95% Cl, 2.47 to 8.01), total dose

of epinephrine (1 mg; aOR, 3.65; 95% Cl, 2.61 to 5.18), call-response
time (<5 minutes; aOR, 3.58; 95% Cl, 1.98 to 6.69), witnessed arrest (aOR,
2.17; 95% Cl, 1.51 to 3.16), and pulseless electrical activity as an initial
rhythm (aOR, 2.02; 95% Cl, 1.46 to 2.80) were significantly associated
with CPC 1 to 2 at 1 month in the epinephrine administration cohort.
Conclusion In OHCA patients with unshockable initial rhythm,
prehospital epinephrine administration significantly increased the rate
of survival at 1 month after cardiac arrest. The best single predictor for
favorable neurological outcomes at 1 month following prehospital
epinephrine administration after cardiac arrest was age (<66 years)
followed by total dose of epinephrine (1 mg) and then by call-response
time (<5 minutes).

Impact of termination of resuscitation for out-of-hospital
cardiopulmonary arrest in Japan

Introduction What can one anticipate from the introduction of
termination of resuscitation (TOR) for patients suffering out-of-hospital
cardiopulmonary arrest (OHCA) in Japan? Irrespective of whether
patients have made a living will requesting that medics do not attempt
resuscitation, efforts are made to resuscitate over 90% of OHCA patients
in Japan [1,2]; the number of people resuscitated exceed 120,000
every year. The 2010 American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency cardiovascular
care (ECC) defined the criteria for TOR; this initiative may help reduce
the number of unnecessary hospital transports by 40 to 60% and hold
down medical costs [3].

Methods This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of
patients who suffered OHCA and were transported to our hospital
between April 2009 and March 2011. We investigated the patients’
characteristics, whether they met the TOR criteria, and their outcome
at the time of hospital discharge.

Results A total of 195 patients (mean age, 69 years), 67% of whom
were male, were transported to our hospital after suffering OHCA.
Cardiopulmonary arrest was witnessed in 52 cases (27%). The 2010
AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC regarding the criteria for TOR were
applied in 126 cases (65%), of whom 113 (90%) were dead on arrival,
and 13 were successfully resuscitated and admitted. The outcomes for
these 13 patients were as follows: 10 died in the hospital, two patients
were discharged with a Glasgow Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance
Category (CPC) score of 1, and one patient was transferred to another
hospital with a CPC score of 3.

Conclusion In our study, 65% of the patients who were transported to
the hospital after OHCA met the criteria for TOR. Outcomes for patients
who met the TOR criteria were significantly worse than those who did
not meet the criteria (2.4% vs. 14.5%, P <0.005). In Japan, efforts are
made to resuscitate almost all individuals who suffer OHCA, but 75%
of those patients die within a day. In light of the fact that even the
medical cost for each of these patients who die within a day amounts
to US$1,500 [4], the introduction of TOR will have a particularly strong
impact in Japan.

detection and resuscitation of cardiopulmonary arrest are crucial for
better clinical outcome. We conducted our study to evaluate event
survival of in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest after regular working
hours in nonmonitored areas of a tertiary-care center.
Methods A retrospective chart review of all adult patients who
developed in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest between January
2010 and December 2011. Working hours are defined as 07:00 to
17:00 Saturday to Wednesday. Event survival is defined as return
of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for more than 20 minutes.
Adult patients 18 years and above who suffered from in-hospital
cardiopulmonary arrest were included. Patients were excluded if
they had cardiopulmonary arrest in the emergency department, had
implantable cardiovascular device, arrested in monitored areas or had
pre-existing DNR orders. Data analysis was accomplished using SAS,
version 9.3 (SAS institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results A total of 430 cardiopulmonary arrest events occurred in-
hospital between January 2010 and December 2011. A total of 326
patients were excluded because 252 occurred in the ICU, 70 in the
coronary care unit and four in the stork unit. In total, 104 patients
were enrolled; 50.9% where female and 49.1% male. Median age was
61 years. A total 41.3% of the arrests were due to respiratory arrest
and 58.7% due to cardiac arrest. Out of 104 patients who developed
cardiopulmonary arrest, 47 (45.19%) occurred during regular working
hours, and 57 (54.81%) occurred after regular working hours (P=0.0081).
The event survival was 87.23% during regular working hours compared
with 47.37% for the patients who developed cardiopulmonary arrest
after regular working hours (P <0.0001). In total, 53.19% of those who
developed cardiopulmonary arrest during regular working hours were
discharged alive from the ICU compared with 26.32% of those who
developed cardiopulmonary arrest after regular working hours.
Conclusion Event survival and survival to discharge were significantly
higher in patients who developed cardiopulmonary arrest during
regular working hours.

Introduction Before the introduction of primary percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI) and therapeutic hypothermia (TH) to out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest (QOHCA) management, survival to hospital discharge
with intact neurological function was poor [1,2]. We aimed to quantify
the survival and degree of neurological impairment in OOHCA patients
admitted to our ICU since the adoption of post-OOHCA bundles.
Methods Sixty-nine consecutive OOHCA patients admitted to the ICU
at Hammersmith Hospital from 1 January 2011 to 30 June 2012 were
identified and reviewed from hospital databases. Cognitive status was
scored using Cerebral Performance Category (CPC); 1 to 2 normal-mild
and 3 to 4 moderate-severe neurological impairment. Scores were
determined from ICU summaries, occupational and physiotherapy
reports. Hospital discharge outcomes were determined from hospital
databases.

Results TH was initiated in 93% (64/69) of OOHCA patients and 87%
(40/46) with ischaemic cardiac aetiology underwent PCI. ICU survival
was 58% (40/69); 65% (26/40) scoring CPC 1 to 2 and 35% (14/40) CPC 3
to 4 at ICU discharge. Two patients with CPC 2 improved to CPC 1 during
their hospital stay. All patients with CPC 1 to 2 survived to hospital
discharge; two required general rehabilitation before returning home.
Only 43% (6/14) of CPC 3 to 4 patients survived to hospital discharge;
none returned home. Two went into hospice care, one was repatriated
to another hospital and three went to neuro-rehab. No CPC 3 to 4
patients improved CPC scores after ICU discharge. Overall hospital
survival was 46%. See Table 1.

Conclusion OOHCA patients admitted to our ICU had a 46% chance
of surviving to hospital discharge. Most patients left hospital with
good neurological status (CPC 1 to 2); moderate-severe neurological

subsequent to adoption of OOHCA bundles but suggest further work is
required in neuro-disabled survivors.

Introduction During cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) monitoring
possibilities are limited. Parnia and colleagues investigated the
feasibility and role of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during CPR
in cardiac arrest patients (CA) [1]. NIRS could have a role in predicting
return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Recently, the Equanox® with
four wavelengths sensor was validated to provide absolute data on
regional cerebral saturation [2]. We measured cerebral oxygenation
(rSO,) during CPR with NIRS technology and analyzed the differences
between initial cerebral saturations in patients achieving ROSC
compared with patients without ROSC.

Methods With IRB approval, rSO, was measured with NIRS during
resuscitation in 18 out-of hospital CA patients. The Equanox® Advance
(NONIN), a NIRS monitoring device that measures absolute rSO, values,
was applied on the right side of the patient’s forehead when the
medical emergency team arrived in a resuscitation setting. Placement
of the probe did not interfere with the advanced life support algorithm.
The sensor remained on the patient's forehead during resuscitation,
and if ROSC was reached the probe was removed on arrival at the
emergency department. If ROSC was not achieved, the probe was
removed prehospital. ROSC was defined as ROSC during more than
20 minutes. The Mann-Whitney test was utilized for comparison of
survivor and nonsurvivor data. Student’s t test was performed to
compare the initial rSO..

Results Of the 18 patients, nine patients had ROSC (survivors). The
initial rhythm was the same in both groups, six patients in each
group had asystole as initial rhythm. In the group of survivors were
six female patients, in the nonsurvivors were two female patients. The
mean age in ROSC and no-ROSC groups is respectively 75.8 years (SD
+12.8) and 69.4 years (SD +22.9, P = 0.48). The mean rSO, at arrival of
the emergency medical team was 31.56% (SD +29.4) and 12.78% (SD
+12.7) respectively in the ROSC group and no-ROSC group (P = 0.1).
The mean time between collapse and start of CPR (basic life support
of bystanders) was 6.9 minutes (SD +8.2) in the no-ROSC group and
8.2 minutes (SD +7.08, P = 0.69) in the ROSC group.

Conclusion Initial rSO, values in out-of hospital CA patients with ROSC
showed a tendency towards higher values compared with nonsurvivors,
but no significant difference could be demonstrated, probably related
to the small number of patients included in this preliminary report.

Introduction In-hospital (IHCA) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
(OHCA) are associated with high mortality [1]. Studies suggest that
up to 68% of OHCA is due to acute coronary syndrome, with 38%
requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [1]. However,
revascularisation may not always be available or address the underlying
pathology. This study aimed to establish the prevalence of different
aetiologies for IHCA and OHCA, and the use of emergency treatment
for these patients.

Methods A retrospective case-note review of all patients admitted
between 2008 and 2011 to the ICU of an inner-city university hospital
after OHCA or IHCA. Biometric data, presenting cardiac rhythm,
presumed cause of arrest, management and outcomes were recorded.
The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for numerical data analysis and chi-
square test for categorical data.

Results Data were analysed for 64 patients — 44 (69%) following OHCA
and 20 (31%) after IHCA. The median APACHE score for OHCA was
17 and for IHCA was 23.5 (P = 0.001). Hospital survival rate was 10%
(n = 2) for IHCA and 38.6% (n = 17) for OHCA (P <0.02). A total of 34.1%
(n = 15) OHCA were due to myocardial infarction (MI) compared with
10% (n = 2) of IHCA (P <0.05). The most prevalent aetiologies were MI
(n = 17), hypoxia (n = 10), cardiac other (n = 5), sepsis (n = 4), arrhythmia
(n = 3) and PE (n = 3). In two IHCA patients more than one likely cause
of arrest was reported and in 19 cases no cause was identified. The
presenting rhythm was ventricular fibrillation (VF) in 45.3% (n = 29),
pulseless electrical activity in 32.8% (n = 21) and asystole in 20.3%
(n = 13). A total of 9.4% (n = 6) were thrombolysed and one (1.6%)
patient was referred for emergency PCI.

Conclusion As previously reported [2], IHCA was associated with a
worse prognosis than OHCA. The OHCA survival rate was better than
reported elsewhere [3]. The percentage of IHCA attributed to MI was
low. Only one OHCA patient was referred for emergency PCI. Routine
coronary angiography with ad hoc PCI in VF OHCA has been associated
with increased survival [4]. Greater availability of PCl post OHCA could
further improve mortality in patients with a primary cardiac pathology.
Further investigation should include management of noncardiogenic
cardiac arrest.

for 24 hours. Esophageal temperature was monitored; continuous
intravenous sedation-analgesia was maintained for 48 hours after
initiation of MTH. The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was used to
analyze the neurological outcomes after hospital discharge.

Results From January 2009 to April 2012, 84 patients submitted to MTH
were divided into two groups: Group 1, 54 patients presented out-
of-hospital cardiac arrest; and Group 2, 30 patients had intra-hospital
cardiac arrest. Both groups were similar regarding to gender; Group
2 tended to be older (mean age 44.3 years vs. 33.5 years, P = 0.07),
and had more frequently asystole as the cardiac arrest rhythm (45%
vs. 15 %, P = 0.10). Group 2 had shorter duration of resuscitation
(12.3 minutes vs. 33.7 minutes, P = 0.03), longer time to hypothermia
initiation (309.3 minutes vs. 212.8 minutes, P = 0.04), longer hospital
stay after cardiac arrest (50.7 days vs. 32.4 days, P = 0.01) and worse
neurological outcome, characterized by the presence of GOS <3 at 30
days (68.4% vs. 35.1%, P = 0.03). Hospital mortality was 5.5% in Group 1
and 13.3% in Group 2 (P = 0.21). The 1-year survival rate was 85.1% in
Group 1 and 83.3% in Group 2 (P = 0.43); after 1 year follow-up, GOS
<3 was present in 30.4% of Group 2 patients and in 11.1% of Group 1
patients (P = 0.04).

Conclusion Midterm neurological outcome of MTH after in hospital
cardiac arrest seems to be not as good as after out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest. Delay in hypothermia initiation, older age and associated
comorbidities could explain the worse evolution of this group of
patients.

Introduction The benefit of primary percutaneous intervention (PCI)
in the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is not
clear cut [1]. It has historically been used in patients with ST elevation
on post-resuscitation electrocardiogram (ECG) although this is a poor

S117

with other studies suggesting benefit for primary PCI regardless of the

post-resuscitation ECG [3]. Cooling was not found to improve survival

to discharge but further analysis is required to determine impact on

neurological function.

Introduction Sedation and therapeutic hypothermia (TH) modify
neurological examination and alter prognostic prediction of coma after
cardiac arrest (CA). Additional tools, such as EEG and evoked potentials,
improve prediction of outcome in this setting, but are not widely
available and require significant implementation.

Methods Using a new device for infrared pupillometry, we examined the
value of quantitative pupillary light reactivity (PLR) to predict outcome
in comatose post-CA patients treated with TH. Twenty-four comatose
CA patients treated with TH (33°C, 24 hours) were prospectively
studied. The percentage variation in PLR was measured during TH
(12 hours from CA), using the NeuroLight Algiscan® (IDMED, Marseille,

with survival and neurological outcome (CPC scores) at 3 months was
analyzed, and the predictive value of PLR was compared with that of
standard clinical examination (motor response and brainstem reflexes)
performed at 48 hours from CA.

Results Quantitative PLR was strongly associated with survival (median
left-eye PLR 14% (11 to 16%) variation in survivors vs. 5.5% (4 to 8.5%)
in nonsurvivors, P < 0.0001) and 3-month neurological outcome (14%
(11 to 21%) in patients with CPC 1 to 2 vs. 5.5% (4 to 8.5%) in those
with CPC 3 to 5, P<0.0001). Comparable findings were obtained using
right-eye PLR. A PLR >10% was 100% predictive of patient prognosis,
with false-positive and false-negative rates of 0% for outcome. Clinical
examination was significantly associated with outcome; however,
motor response (MR) and brainstem reflexes (BRS) yielded higher false-
positive and false-negative rates than PLR (Table 1).

Conclusion Quantitative PLR appears highly accurate and superior to
standard neurological examination to predict outcome in patients with
post-CA coma. Further study is warranted to confirm these promising
findings.

Effect of moderate hyperventilation and induced hypertension on
cerebral tissue oxygen saturation in comatose post-cardiac arrest
patients treated with hypothermia

T Suys, N Sala, M Oddo

Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P311 (doi: 10.1186/cc12249)

Introduction Maintenance of adequate brain perfusion is an essential
component of post-resuscitation care. Mean arterial pressure (MAP)
and PaCO, are important determinants of brain perfusion; however, no
precise guidelines exist for optimal MAP and PaCO, targets in comatose
post-cardiac arrest (CA) patients.

Methods Using NIRS, we examined changes in non-invasive cerebral
tissue oxygen saturation (SctO,) following moderate hyperventilation
(HV) and induced hypertension (IH) in comatose CA patients treated
with therapeutic hypothermia (TH). A prospective pilot study including
comatose patients successfully resuscitated from out-of-hospital CA
treated with TH (33°C for 24 hours, using cold saline and surface cooling
device), monitored for continuous SctO, with the Foresight NIRS system
(CAS Medical Systems, Branford, CT, USA). Moderate hyperventilation
was induced for approximately 30 minutes by decreasing PaCO, from
~40 to ~30 mmbhg, at stable MAP. After PaCO, normalization, MAP
was increased from ~70 to ~90 mmHg by intravenous infusion of
norepinephrine, at stable PaCO,. Effects of MV and IH on SctO, were
analyzed with a paired t test.

Results Ten patients (mean age, 69.5; mean time to ROSC, 19 minutes)
were studied during the stable TH maintenance phase. Results are
summarized in Figure 1. MV was associated with a significant reduction
of SctO, from baseline (75% (73 to 76) to 69% (67.5 to 71.5), P <0.001).

$118

No significant changes in SctO, were found after IH (74 (72 to 76) vs. 75
(73 to 75.5), P=0.24).

Conclusion Moderate HV was associated with significant reduction
in cerebral saturation, whilst IH may be detrimental after CA and TH,
whilst increasing MAP to supranormal levels with vasopressors does
not improve cerebral oxygenation. These data stress the importance of
strict control of PaCO, following CA and TH to avoid secondary cerebral
ischemic insults.

Effects of viscosity on cerebral blood flow after cardiac arrest

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P312 (doi: 10.1186/cc12250)

Introduction After cardiac arrest, microcirculatory reperfusion disorders
develop despite adequate cerebral perfusion pressure. Increased blood
viscosity strongly hampers the microcirculation, resulting in plugging
of the capillary bed, arteriovenous shunting and diminished tissue
perfusion. The aim of the present study was to assess blood viscosity in
relation to cerebral blood flow in patients after cardiac arrest.
Methods We performed an observational study in 10 comatose
patients after cardiac arrest. Patients were treated with hypothermia for
24 hours. Blood viscosity was measured ex vivo using a Contraves LS300
viscometer. Mean flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MFVMCA)
was measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD) at the same time points.

second, and remained stable at 3 and 6 hours after admission. From
6 hours after admission, viscosity decreased significantly to 3.66 (3.12
to 4.04) mPa.second (P <0.001). Median MFVMCA was low (27.0 (23.8
to 30.5) cm/second) on admission, and significantly increased to 63.0
(51.0 to 80.0) cm/second at 72 hours (P <0.001). There was a significant
association between viscosity and the MFVMCA (P = 0.0019). See
Figure 1.

Conclusion Viscosity decreases in the first 3 days after cardiac arrest
and is strongly associated with an increase in cerebral blood flow.
Since viscosity is a major determinant of cerebral blood flow, repeated
measurements may guide therapy to help restore cerebral oxygenation
after cardiac arrest.

Therapeutic mild hypothermia after cardiac arrest in shockable
and nonshockable rhythms: does it improve both survival and
neurological outcome?

A Gupta

Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, New Delhi, India

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P313 (doi: 10.1186/cc12251)

Introduction Although therapeutic mild hypothermia (TMH) after
resuscitation from cardiac arrest (CA) has been postulated and studied
to be associated with good outcome of the patients, there is no dearth
of data that does not favour TMH. Our aim was to find out whether
TMH is associated with good outcome after CA in shockable rhythm
(SR) compared with nonshockable rhythm (NR), in terms of survival as
well as neurological outcome.

Methods We reviewed medical records of all CA patients (in-hospital
or out-of-hospital arrest) in whom cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
was performed at our hospital from 1 February 2011 to 31 January 2012
(12 months). The following information was collected: first documented
rhythm, whether TMH done or not, and two outcome measures
including survival to hospital discharge and neurological outcome
at the time of hospital discharge. A measure of good neurological
outcome was Cerebral Performance Category score 1 or 2 (CPC, five-
point scale; 1 = good cerebral performance to 5 = brain death). Then
we quantified the association of TMH with SR as well as NR for both
the parameters of outcome - that is, survival to hospital discharge and
good neurological outcome -— by logistic regression analysis.

Results We had 297 CA patients (168 SR, 129 NR) in whom CPR was
done. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 90 patients.
TMH was induced in 57 patients (33 SR, 24 NR). Survival to hospital
discharge was observed in 27 patients (18/33 (54.5%) SR, 9/24 (37.5%)
NR), out of which 18 patients (10/33 (30%) SR, 8/24 (33%) NR) had good
neurological outcome. On analysis, TMH was found to be associated
with increased odds of survival to hospital discharge (although
statistically not significant) in SR patients compared with NR patients
(odds ratio (OR) = 2.00; 95% Cl = 0.68 to 5.85; P = 0.2837), but it was not
associated with any better neurological outcome in terms of CPC score
in patients presenting with SR rather than NR (OR = 0.87; 95% Cl = 0.28
to 2.68; P = 1.0000). Rather, the odds for good neurological outcome
were more in favour of NR (pulseless electrical activity/asystole).
Conclusion Although TMH might be associated with better survival
chances in patients presenting with SR, neurological outcome was no
better (rather worse) in this group of patients when compared with
patients with NR as the first documented rhythm.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P314 (doi: 10.1186/cc12252)

Introduction Measurement of temperature during treatment with
therapeutic hypothermia can yield variable values depending on

S119

where temperature is measured. Measurements of temperature can
be made rectally, intravascularly, vaginally, or from the bladder, but
agreement between these sites is often uncertain. We measured
temperature at multiple sites during experimental induction and
reversal of hypothermia in swine with a novel esophageal cooling
device, hypothesizing that agreement between sites would fall within
standard acceptance criteria (average difference + 1.96 standard
deviation of the difference) in Bland-Altman analyses.
Methods Five female Yorkshire swine (mean weight 65 kg) were
anesthetized and cooled for 24 hours, then gradually rewarmed, with
a novel esophageal heat transfer device powered by an external chiller
(Gaymar MediTherm Ill). Swine temperature was measured intra-
vascularly, rectally, and either vaginally or in the bladder. Comparisons
between temperature readings were then made via Bland-Altman
plots.
Results Agreement between the different sources of temperature
measurement was generally high, with less than 10% outliers beyond
+1.96 SD. The best agreement was seen between intravascular
temperature measurement and bladder temperature measurement
(SD = 0.14°C), with vaginal measurements showing less agreement
(SD = 0.23°C), and rectal measurements showing the least (SD = 0.31°C)
with intravascular.
Conclusion Bladder temperature measurements demonstrated the
best agreement with intravascular temperature measurements during
cooling with an esophageal heat transfer device; however, reasonable
agreement was demonstrated with rectal and vaginal temperature
measurements, suggesting that these sites are also acceptable for use.

Introduction Optimal oxygenation level during post-cardiac arrest
(PCA) care is currently undefined, and studies have suggested
harm from hyperoxia exposure [1]. We aimed to assess the optimal
oxygenation level and possible associations of time-weighted exposure
to hyperoxia on outcome in patients during PCA care.

Methods We conducted a prospective observational cohort study in
21 ICUs in Finland between 2009 and 2010. The Utstein Guidelines
were used for collecting resuscitation and PCA care data, such as
initial rhythm and delay to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).
Measured arterial blood oxygen values during the first 24 hours from
admission to the ICU were divided into the following predefined
oxygenation categories: low (<10 kPa), normal (10 to 19 kPa),
intermediate (20 to 29 kPa), and high (>30 kPa). Exposure to hyperoxia
was defined as paO, levels higher than 40 kPa [1]. Time spent in
different oxygenation categories and the highest, lowest and median
oxygen values during the first 24 hours were calculated and included
in separate multivariate regression models along with age, delay to
ROSC, initial rhythm and the use of therapeutic hypothermia for the
prediction of 6-month mortality.

Results A total of 489 patients were included. The average number of
paO, measurements during the first 24 hours was eight per patient.
A total of 6% of patients experienced paO, values higher than 40 kPa
at any time during the first 24 hours. Average times spent in each
time oxygenation category during the first 24 hours were as follows:
low 14%, normal 69%, intermediate 14%, and high 2% of the time.
Survivors spent less time in the low band (P = 0.029) and more time
in the intermediate band (P = 0.029) compared with nonsurvivors. The
median paO, during the first 24 hours was higher in survivors than in
nonsurvivors (15 kPa vs. 14 kPa, P = 0.016) but there was no difference
in lowest (11 kPa vs. 10 kPa, P = 0.162) or the highest paO, values

(22 kPa vs. 20 kPa, P = 0.054). In separate multivariate models neither
time spent in the low or the intermediate categories, or the median,
highest or lowest paO, was found to correlate with mortality.
Conclusion In this multicentre observational study we were unable
to define an optimal oxygenation level during PCA care, but hypoxia
seemed to be more harmful than hyperoxia. Exposure to hyperoxia was
less common than in previous trials, and we were unable to confirm
previous findings indicating an association with mortality.

Neuron-specific enolase and bispectral index/suppression ratio for
prognostication after cardiac arrest

M Van Laer', K Deschilder?, P Lormans?, J Gillet', W Stockman?

'UZ Leuven, Belgium; 7HHRM, Roeselare, Belgium

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P316 (doi: 10.1186/cc12254)

Introduction Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) values >33 g/ml [1] and
low bispectral index (BIS) [2] values correlate with bad outcome after
cardiac arrest (CA).

Methods In this nonblinded prospective study, we observed all CA
patients from February 2011 until September 2012 surviving at least
24 hours. NSE was measured between 24 and 72 hours after CA. From
October 2011 onward, we recorded BIS and suppression ratio (SR)
values as soon as possible after arrival in the ICU. Patients treated
with therapeutic hypothermia (TH) (33°C for 24 hours) received
cisatracurium. Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) [3] 1 and 2 were
considered good outcome, CPC 3 to 5 bad outcome and were recorded
after 3 months. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistics
19.

Results NSE >45 occurred in 24/68 patients (35.3%) and invariably
correlates with bad outcome. The positive predictive value (PPV) NSE
>45 for bad outcome is 100%. No patient in this group ever had a GCS
>12. NSE >33 and <45 occurred in 16/68 patients (23.5%). Thirteen
out of 16 patients (81.2%) had bad outcome. However, 7/16 patients
(43.8%) woke up at some time (GCS =12). NSE <33 occurred in 28/68
patients (41.2%), 17/28 patients (60.7%) had good outcome and 23/28
patients (88.4%) had GCS =12 at some time. The PPV NSE <33 for good
outcome is 60.7%. The BIS and SR were measured in only 28 patients.
Initial BIS <10 occurred in 13/28 patients (46.4%) and correlates with
bad outcome in 12/13 patients (92.3%). BIS >30 occurred in nine
patients, 6/9 (66.7%) had good outcome. Initial SR =>75 occurred in
11/28 patients (39.3%) and invariably correlates with bad outcome.
NSE >25 and SR >60 occurred in 15/28 patients (53.6%) and invariably
correlates with bad outcome.

Conclusion NSE >45 uniformly correlates with bad outcome after CA.
However, we urge caution for the use of intermediate values (33 to 45).
In preliminary data, we report that SR >75 might correlate with bad
outcome and that combining NSE and SR might improve the predictive
value. Also, low NSE and good initial BIS values correlate with preserved
cerebral potential and should encourage the clinician.

Motor scores, therapeutic hypothermia and neurological outcome
after cardiac arrest

M Davidson

Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, Plymouth, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P317 (doi: 10.1186/cc12255)

Introduction Accurate prediction of neurological outcome after
cardiac arrest is desirable to prevent inappropriate withdrawal of life-
sustaining therapy in patients who could have a good neurological
outcome, and to limit active treatment in patients whose ultimate
neurological outcomes are poor. Established guidelines to predict
neurological outcome after cardiac arrest were developed before the

$120

widespread use of therapeutic hypothermia. The American Association
of Neurology guidelines [1] currently recommend that absent or
extensor motor scores on day 3 post arrest are reliable indicators or
poor neurological outcome with a false positive rate of 0 to 3%.
Methods A review of existing literature was undertaken to examine
whether the utility of motor scores to predict poor neurological
outcome is influenced by the use of therapeutic hypothermia.

Results Six studies were identified [2-7] that investigated the use of
motor scores on day 3 post cardiac arrest in patients who had received
therapeutic hypothermia. False positive rates (defined as 1 - specificity)
for predicting poor neurological outcome were calculable in five of the
six studies [2-6] and were 14%, 24%, 11%, 25% and 12% respectively.
In all studies the FPR for motor scores of extension or worse were
significantly higher than the 0% (0 to 3% 95% Cls) in the AAN guidelines.
Conclusion Motor scores at day 3 post cardiac arrest of extension
or worse do not reliably predict poor neurological outcome when
therapeutic hypothermia has been used. Clinical neurological findings
may not be valid predictors of poor neurological outcome after
therapeutic hypothermia.

Differences of calcium binding protein immunoreactivities in the
young hippocampal CA1 region from the adult following transient
ischemic damage

CW Park, HY Lee, JH Cho, MH Won

Kangwon National University, Chuncheonsi, South Korea

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P318 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12256)

Introduction It has been reported that the young are much more
resistant to transient cerebral ischemia than the adult.

Methods In the present study, we compared the chronological
changes of calcium binding proteins (CBPs) (calbindin 28k (CB-D 28k),
calretinin (CR) and parvalbumin (PV)) immunoreactivities and levels
in the hippocampal CA1 region of the young gerbil with those in the
adult following 5 minutes of transient cerebral ischemia induced by the
occlusion of both the common carotid arteries.

Results In the present study, we examined that about 90% of CA1
pyramidal cells in the adult gerbil hippocampus died at 4 days post
ischemia; however, in the young hippocampus, about 56% of them
died at 7 days post ischemia. We compared immunoreactivities and
levels of CBPs, such as CB-D 28k, CR and PV. The immunoreactivities
and protein levels of all the CBPs in the young sham were higher than
those in the adult sham. In the adult, the immunoreactivities and
protein levels of all the CBPs were markedly decreased at 4 days post
ischemia; however, in the young, they were apparently maintained. At
7 days post ischemia, they were decreased in the young; however, they
were much higher than those in the adult.

Conclusion In brief, the immunoreactivities and levels of CBPs were not
decreased in the ischemic CA1 region of the young 4 days after transient
cerebral ischemia. This finding indicates that the longer maintenance
of CBPs may contribute to a less and more delayed neuronal death/
damage in the young.

and rapid induction of hypothermia will mitigate neuronal injury and
improve survival in a swine model of TBI.

Methods Twenty domestic cross-bred pigs (34 to 35 kg) were subjected
to a 5 ATM (100 ms) lateral fluid percussion TBI. The brain temperature
and ICP were measured using Camino®. Serum biomarkers for neuronal
injury - S-1008, neuron-specific enolase, glial fibrillary acid protein
(GFAP), and neurofilaments heavy chain - were measured daily using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twelve of the injured animals
were rapidly cooled to 32°C within 90 minutes of the injury using
a transpulmonary hypothermia technique [2]. Hypothermia was
maintained for 48 hours. Eight injured control animals were maintained
at 37°C. In both groups, anesthesia (isoflurane 1%) was discontinued
and the animals were weaned off the ventilator after 48 hours. Five days
post injury, the surviving animals were euthanized and necropsied. The
data were analyzed using a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test, and ANOVA.
Results Ten of the 12 hypothermia and four of the eight normothermia
animals survived to the end of the 5-day study (x? = 2.597, df = 1,
P = 0.1071). Although the probability of type | error between survival
curves was 11%, the study was clinically significant and showed a clear
trend toward improved survival with hypothermia. The intracranial
pressures were significantly (P <0.05) lower in the hypothermia group.
Both interventions — that is, general anesthesia and hypothermia -
mitigated the rise of serum biomarkers following TBI. However, the
suppression of biomarkers was sustained during the recovery period
only in the hypothermia group. With the exception of the GFAP levels,
the curves of all biomarkers were significantly different between the
groups.

Conclusion Our preliminary findings show early initiation, rapid
induction, and prolonged maintenance (48 hours) of cerebral
hypothermia to lower intracranial pressure, blunt the rise in serum
biomarkers, and improve survival following TBI.

Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a contributing factor
to approximately one-third of all injury-related deaths in the USA
annually. Updated statistical records for TBI in Egypt are lacking. The
current research is aiming to estimate the prevalence of TBI in Egypt in
order to develop a comprehensive TBI prevention program.

Methods A 1-year period (one calendar month every quarter of
2010) descriptive epidemiological study of moderate and severe TBI
cases admitted to the emergency department, Cairo main university
hospital. The data collection sheet included personal data (age, sex and
residency), incident-related data (cause, nature and time of injury) and
both clinical and radiological findings.

Results Table 1 shows the magnitude of the problem, highlighting the
leading causes of TBI in Egypt in 2010. Male sex was predominantly
affected, 79% of cases. Moderate and severe injuries account for 17.2%
of all TBI presented cases.

Conclusion TBI is a serious public health problem in Egypt. Further
data interpretation over wider periods of time should be conducted
for better understanding of TBI prevalence is highly recommended to
develop effective injury prevention programs.

Introduction Transport directly to a neurosurgical trauma center has
shown to reduce mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).
We hypothesized that alcohol intoxication may impede prehospital
recognition of TBI, resulting in transportation to a non-neurosurgical
hospital.

Methods A retrospective analysis of TBI patients admitted to a
designated neurosurgical trauma center's ICU in 2009/10 and primarily
treated by the Emergency Medical Service (EMS). Patients were divided
into two categories based either direct or indirect trauma transfer by
the EMS. Directly transferred patients are directly transported to the
neurosurgical trauma center from the injury scene while indirectly
transported patients are initially transported to another non-
neurosurgical hospital before re-transfer to the trauma center. Data
from patient journals and EMS forms were extracted. The blood alcohol
level (BAL) was measured by the EMS using an alcohol breath-test.
Logistic regression modeling was used to identify variables present at
scene associated with transport destination.

Results Totally 470 patients met the inclusion criteria; 60% were
transported directly and 40% indirectly. In the direct group 15% of
patients had a positive BAL, compared with 26% for those indirectly
transported. In the logistic regression model, factors associated
with direct transport were: BAL =2.3%o (OR: 0.06, Cl: 0.01 to 0.36),
male gender (OR: 0.35; Cl: 0.16 to 0.76), GCS 13 to 15 (OR: 0.28; Cl
0.10 to 0.74), high-energy trauma (OR: 9.42; Cl 2.15 to 41.20), major
extracranial injury (OR: 7.92; Cl 2.57 to 24.41), EMS physician telephone
consultation (OR: 6.02; Cl 2.51 to 14.11) or presence on scene (OR: 8.63;
Cl 3.50 to 21.26) and incident at a public place outside (OR: 3.05; Cl:
1.34 to 6.4) and inside (OR: 2.92; Cl: 1.07 to 8.01). Median time delay
to trauma center admission was 1:07 hours (IQR: 0.52 to 1:28) for
directly transported patients and 4:06 (IQR: 2.54 to 5:43) for those
indirectly transported (P <0.001). There was a clear trend towards
poorer neurological outcome for patients with delayed trauma center
admission in univariate analysis (P = 0.001).

Conclusion Heavily alcohol intoxicated TBI patients are commonly
initially transported to a non-neurosurgical trauma center and this may
worsen 6-month neurological outcome.

Predictive ability of the IMPACT-TBI prognostic model is improved
by adding markers of coagulation

R Raj, J Siironen, R Kivisaari, L Handolin, J Hernesniemi, M Skrifvars
Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P322 (doi: 10.1186/cc12260)

Introduction One of the most used prognostic models for traumatic
brain injury is the IMPACT-TBI model, which predicts 6-month mortality
and unfavorable outcome. Our aim was to study whether adding
markers of coagulation improves the model's predictive power when
accounting for extracranial injury.

Methods Patients with a TBI admitted to a designated trauma center
in 2009/10 were screened retrospectively and included according
to the IMPACT study criteria. The predictive outcome was calculated
for included patients using the full IMPACT-TBI model. To assess
coagulopathy and extracranial injury we used the prothrombin time
percentage (PT), platelet count (10°), and injury severity score (ISS).
PT, platelets and ISS were added to the IMPACT model, creating
new models. The predictive power of the new models was tested by
comparing their area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC) with the original model.

Results Totally 342 were included. Six-month mortality was 32% and
unfavorable outcome 57%. The IMPACT model’s predictive power
for mortality and neurological outcome; AUC: 0.85, Cl: 0.81 to 0.89;
and AUC: 0.81, Cl: 0.76 to 0.86. Nonsurvivors and patients with an
unfavorable outcome had lower platelets (159; 165 vs. 191; 198), PT
(76; 77 vs. 86; 90) and higher ISS (50; 44% ISS >25 vs. 34; 32% ISS >25)
compared with survivors and favorable outcome (P <0.05). Addition of
PT but not ISS nor platelets resulted in a significant improvement of the
IMPACT model's predictive power for 6-month mortality; AUC: 0.87, Cl:
0.81 to 0.89, P = 0.017 (Figure 1). In multivariate analysis PT remained
an independent significant predictor of outcome when adjusting for
IMPACT prognosis and ISS (OR: 0.985, Cl: 0.975 to 0.996).

Conclusion Addition of PT to the IMPACT model improves the
predictive power for 6-month mortality but not neurological outcome
when adjusting for ISS.

Introduction Evidence suggest that endogenous lactate, produced by
aerobic glycolysis, is an important substrate for neurons, particularly in

$122

conditions of increased energy demand. This study aimed to examine
brain lactate metabolism in patients with severe traumatic brain injury
(STBI).

Methods A prospective cohort of STBI patients monitored with
cerebral microdialysis (CMD) and brain tissue oxygen (PbtO,) was
studied. Brain lactate metabolism was assessed by quantification
of elevated CMD lactate samples (>4 mmol/l). These were matched
to pyruvate and PbtO,, and dichotomized as hyperglycolytic (CMD
pyruvate >119 mol/l) versus nonhyperglycolytic or as hypoxic (PbtO,
<20 mmHg) versus nonhypoxic. Data were expressed as percentages
per patient. Global brain perfusion (categorized as oligemic, normal or
hyperemic) was assessed with CT perfusion (CTP).

Results Twenty-four patients (total 1,782 CMD samples) were studied.
Samples with elevated CMD lactate were frequently observed (41 + 8%
SEM of individual samples). Brain lactate elevations were predominantly
hyperglycolytic (73 + 8.2%), whilst only 14 + 6.3% of them were hypoxic.
Trends over time of both lactate patterns are shown in Figure 1.On CTP
(n = 17; average 48 hours from TBI) hyperglycolytic lactate was always
associated with normal or hyperemic CTP, whilst hypoxic lactate was
associated with oligemic CTP (Table 1).

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P324 (doi: 10.1186/cc12262)

Introduction In the prehospital setting, it is difficult to use the
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) to evaluate the consciousness state using
in pediatric patients with severe trauma. The Japan Coma Scale (JCS) is
a consciousness scale used widely in Japan and, with its four grades, is
simpler and quicker to use than the GCS. This study examined whether

the JCS can predict clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI) and outcome in
pediatric patients aged 3 to 15 years in the prehospital setting.
Methods This retrospective study analyzed data from the Japan Trauma
Data Bank. Registered pediatric patients aged 3 to 15 years with severe
trauma (maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale score =3 or Injury Severity
Score =9) were divided into four groups according to JCS score in the
prehospital setting (Grade 0: alert, Grade 1: possible eye-opening, not
lucid, Grade 2: possible eye-opening upon stimulation, Grade 3: no
eye-opening and coma). TBI was defined as maximum head AIS =3.
Results A total of 1,562 patients were included (Grade 0: 673, Grade 1:
410, Grade 2: 230, Grade 3: 249). Victims of blunt trauma accounted for
98.1%. Median age was 9 (interquartile range: 7 to 12) years, median
ISS was 16 (9 to 21). There was strong agreement between the JCS in
prehospital setting and GCS scores on arrival at hospital (r = -0.745,
P <0.001). Multivariate analysis adjusted for age and ISS revealed that
the JCS was independently associated with TBI (odds ratio (OR): 2.5;
95% Cl: 2.1 to 2.8, P <0.001) and hospital mortality (OR: 3.8; 95% Cl 2.4
to 6.0, P <0.001). See Table 1.

Methods In this prospective observational study, measurements of
OSND were carried out in 21 patients of a polyvalent 10-bed adult
ICU before and 2 minutes after changes of PEEP from a baseline of 5
with 1 cmH,O increments, to a maximum of 12. Two measurements
were performed with a 7.5 MHz probe (MicroMaxx; Fujifilm Sonosite
Inc., USA) in each eye before and after PEEP changes. Demographic
data (APACHE II score, age, sex, diagnosis) Ppeak and Pm were also
recorded. Exclusion criteria were intracranial pathology, ocular neuritis
and trauma. Normality with P-P plots and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test were calculated followed by bivariate and single linear regression
analysis (IBM SPPS v17, significance P <0.05).

Results Seventy-two measurements were included for further analysis.
Mean + SD values were: PEEP (7.9 + 2.3), Ppeak (24.35 + 5), Pm
(12.03 + 3.16), OSNDright (4.03 + 0.79), OSNDleft (4.1 + 0.79), AOSND
(0.24 + 0.2), while values for age and APACHE II score were 62 + 4 years
and 14.4 + 1.4 respectively. PEEP and OSND seem to have a moderate
relation (tendency equation: OSND = 2.454 + 0.581xPEEP) compared
with the weaker effect of Poeak and Pm (Table 1).

Introduction Non-invasive ocular ultrasonography has recently been
proposed to detect elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). On the other
hand, the effect of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on ICP is
well documented. The aim of the present ongoing study is to record the
effect of changes of airway pressures on optical sheath nerve diameter
(OSND).

Conclusion Our study identified a moderate relation between PEEP
and OSND and a weaker one between Ppeak, Pm and OSND. Thus,
in selected cases OSND could serve as a bedside marker of effect of
airway pressure to ICP. Yet, larger studies are needed to come to a safer
conclusion.

standardized. Intracranial hypertension (ICH), systemic hypotension,
hypoxia, hyperpyrexia and hypocapnia have all been shown to
independently increase mortality [2]. Despite numerous studies, there
is currently no level 1 evidence to support any specific management
[3]. Our objective was to provide an overview of the current clinical
management protocols in the UK.
Methods Thirty-one ICUs managing patients with severe TBI were
identified from the RAIN (Risk Adjustment In Neurocritical care) study,
and a telephone survey was conducted.
Results A total 97% of units used a cerebral perfusion pressure
protocol for the initial management, with 83% targeting pressures of
60 to 70 mmHg and 17% aimed for >70 mmHg. Ninety-one percent of
units monitored CO, routinely with 61% targeting CO, of 4.5 to 5 kPa
(Figure 1). Regarding osmotherapy, mannitol was still the preferred
agent, with 48% of units using it as first line; 32% used hypertonic saline,
while 20% of units used either depending on clinicians’ preference.
Sixteen percent questioned were currently enrolled on the Eurotherm
hypothermia trial, while 16% never used hypothermia and one unit
used prophylactic hypothermia routinely. The remaining 65% of units
used hypothermia only to manage refractory ICH.
Conclusion There is no clear consensus on the initial targets used. The
surviving sepsis campaign showed that protocol-led care can reduce
mortality [4]. Perhaps it is time for a similar approach to be adopted,
with specialists coming to together to review the evidence and
formulate guidelines that can then be tested.

Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of permanent
disability and death in young patients. Controversy exists regarding the
optimal cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) required in TBI management.
A tool for monitoring autoregulation and determining an optimal
CPP is the pressure reactivity index (PRx), defined as a moving
correlation coefficient between the mean arterial blood pressure
(MAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) at a frequency of at least 60 Hz.
This requirement of high frequency has constrained its use to a few
academic centers. An association was shown between outcome and
continuous optimal CPP based on 4 hours of PRx [1]. We present a
novel low-frequency autoregulation index (LAx), based on correlations
between ICP and MAP at a standard minute-by-minute time resolution.
Methods A total of 182 patients from the Brain-IT [2] multicentre
European database had registered outcome and ICP and MAP for
the first 48 ICU hours. Twenty-one TBI patients admitted to the
university hospitals of Leuven, Belgium and Tubingen, Germany were
continuously monitored using ICM+ software (Cambridge Enterprise)
allowing for continuous PRx calculation. Autoregulation indices versus
CPP plots for PRx and LAx were computed to determine optimal CPP
every minute during the first 48 ICU hours [1].

Results On the Brain-IT database, LAx resulted in an optimal CPP for
90% of the first 48 hours. Table 1 shows recommendations with respect
to outcome. In the Leuven-Tubingen database, PRx and LAx resulted in
44% and 92% recommendations respectively. The average difference
between methods was 5.26 mmHg.

Conclusion The differences in optimal CPPs derived from PRx and LAx
were not clinically significant. LAx allowed for recommendations to be

Vanderbilt School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P328 (doi: 10.1186/cc12266)

Introduction Pediatric patients with altered mental status (AMS)
present with poor histories resulting in delayed testing and potential
poor outcomes. Non-invasive detection for altered cerebral physiology
related to TBI would improve resuscitation and outcome. Cerebral
rSO, (rSO,) studies demonstrate its utility in certain neurological
emergencies.

Methods A retrospective analysis of r SO, utility in AMS. rcSO, data were
collected every 30 seconds for AMS patients who had a head CT. Patients
with a negative head CT were compared with those with an abnormal
head CT. ROC analysis was performed to find the AUC for each summary
statistic and performance characteristics. Subgroup analysis was done to
determine whether r_SO, predicted injury and location.

Results r_SO, readings across 5, 15, 20, and 30 minutes were stable
(Figure 1). rSO, readings with one or both sides <50% or a wide
difference between L and R cerebrum was predictive of an abnormal
CT scan. A mean difference of 4.2 was 82% sensitive for detecting a CT
lesion with 62% specificity, 88% PPV, and 52% NPV; a mean difference
of 12.2 was 100% specific for an abnormal head CT. Lower mean r_SO,
readings localized to the CT pathology side, and higher r_SO, readings
trend toward the EDH group.

Conclusion Cerebral rcSO, monitoring can non-invasively detect
altered cerebral physiology and pathology related to TBI as the cause
for pediatric altered mental status. The utility of r SO, monitoring has
shown its potential for localizing and characterizing intracranial lesions
among these altered children. Further studies utilizing r SO, monitoring
as an adjunct tool in pediatric altered mental status evaluation and
management are ongoing.

Results Fifteen NICU patients (nine subarachnoid hemorrhage, five
traumatic brain injury, mean age 54.9 + 16.8, seven (50%) males, median
GCS 7) were prospectively studied. We analyzed the administration
of one dose of paracetamol for each patient (total 14 cases). After
infusion of paracetamol we found a decrease of Temp. (from 37.8 + 0.3
to 37.4 + 0.4°C, P <0.001), MAP (from 94.7 + 9.9 to 86.1 + 6.7 mmHg,
P = 0.008), CPP (from 79.6 + 13.1 to 70.8 + 7.6 mmHg, P = 0.011) and
HR (from 71.5 + 14.9 to 63.8 + 16.3 bpm, P <0.001) with respect to the
starting value (ANOVA for repeated measures), whereas ICP and SjVO,
remained unchanged (Figure 1). In five cases norepinephrine infusion
was started for CPP <60 mmHg. In another two cases, for the same

reason, the norepinephrine dosage was augmented. The proportion of

patients who had infusion of norepinephrine increased from 42.8% at

TO to 78.6% at T120 (P = 0.02, chi-square for trends).

Conclusion Use of i.v. paracetamol is effective in the maintenance

of normothermia in acute brain-injured patients. However, adverse

hemodynamic effects, which could represent a secondary insult for the

injured brain, must be rapidly recognized and treated.

Retrospective analysis of the hemodynamic effects of induction of
barbiturate coma in patients with refractory elevated intracranial
pressure

Introduction Standard clinical practice in patients with elevated
intracranial pressure (ICP) is to keep cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)
at (or above) 60 mmHg: we performed this retrospective study to
analyze whether induction of barbiturate coma impedes compliance
to this target CPP value. It has been repetitively shown that, although
proven as an efficient therapy for refractory elevated ICP, barbiturate
coma may cause a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and CPP
[1].

Methods All patients that had received sodium thiopental in our ICU
during 2011 were identified and their medical and nursing records
were retrospectively analyzed. The effect of administration of sodium
thiopental (loading dose 3 to 5 mg/kg, followed by a continuous
infusion adjusted to obtain an EEG burst suppression ratio between 40
and 80%) on MAP, ICP and CPP was evaluated. Values are reported as
mean + SD. The changes over time in ICP, MAP and CPP are reported as
means with their 95% Cl.

Results In 2011, a total of 20 patients were treated in our ICU with
barbiturate coma for refractory elevated ICP. In five patients, systemic
hypothermia was simultaneously induced. These patients were
excluded from further analysis. Six patients died during their stay in the
ICU and nine patients could be discharged to the neurosurgical ward.
The mean peak ICP value before induction of barbiturate coma was
26 + 3 mmHg, and the ICP value 6 hours later was 20 + 6 mmHg. The
MAP at those same time points was 91 + 12 mmHg and 81 + 11 mmHg,
respectively. The CPP, calculated from both previous values, was
66 + 13 mmHg and 61 + 11 mmHg, respectively. At both time points,
the dose of noradrenaline was comparable (10.1 + 9.6 ug/minute and
11.5 + 13.2 ug/minute, respectively). Analysis of the change in ICP,
MAP and CPP over the 6-hour period showed a significant decrease
in ICP of -5.8 mmHg (-9.3; -2.3) (mean, 95% Cl). The MAP significantly
decreased by -10.4 mmHg (-19.1; -1.7). The decrease in CPP was not
significant (-4.6 mmHg (-14.2; 5.0)).

Conclusion This retrospective study indicates that inducing a thiopental
coma in patients with refractory elevated ICP effectively reduces ICP.
Although the concomitant reduction in MAP was significant, the
resulting decrease in CPP was small and nonsignificant. Moreover, the
target CPP of 60 mmHg was maintained after induction of barbiturate
coma.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P331 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12269)

Introduction Evaluating resource utilization is paramount in critically
ill patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but little is known
on readmissions after hospital discharge. We evaluated rates and
determinants of unplanned readmission following TBI.

Methods We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study from
April 1998 to March 2009. Data were obtained from a Canadian provincial
trauma system, based on mandatory contribution from 59 trauma
centres, and a hospital discharge database. Patients aged =16 years
with TBI (ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes of 850-854 and S06, respectively) were
included. Patients who died during the index hospitalization, who
lived outside the province, who could not be linked with the hospital
discharge database were excluded. We collected baseline and trauma
characteristics, hospital admissions in the 12 months preceding index

$126

admission, and readmissions in the 12 following months. Primary
outcome was unplanned readmission 30 days, 3 months and 6 months
post discharge. We evaluated sociodemographic and clinical factors
associated with readmissions using a logistic regression model.
Results Among 18,342 adult patients with TBI identified in the registry,
14,777 patients were included among which 2,363 had severe, 1,106
moderate and 11,308 mild traumatic brain injury. Most patients were
young (mean age: 52 + 23 years) and had no comorbidity (73.6%).
Overall, 1,032 patients (7.0%) were readmitted within 30 days, 12.7%
within 3 months and 17.6% within 6 months. At 30 days post discharge,
311 (30.1%) were readmitted for a complication. The median length of
stay was 8 days (Q1 to Q3: 3 to 20). More than 10% of patients aged
>75 years with =>1 comorbidity or with =1 admission prior to index
hospitalisation were readmitted. The severity of the TBI was not an
independent predictor of readmission. Age, highest AIS, number of
comorbidities, number of admissions prior to index hospitalization,
level of index trauma center and discharge destination were associated
with readmissions on multivariate analysis.

Conclusion Readmissions in the months following TBI are frequent, but
were not found to be associated with the TBI severity. Further studies
evaluating reasons for readmission are warranted in order to develop
strategies to prevent such events.

Introduction Pituitary disorders following traumatic brain injury
(TBI) are frequent, but their determinants are poorly understood.
We performed a systematic review to assess the risk factors of TBI-
associated pituitary disorders.

Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, The Cochrane
Library, BIOSIS, and Trip Database, and references of narrative reviews
for cohort, cross-sectional and case-control studies enrolling at least
five adults with TBI in whom =1 pituitary axis was tested and one
potential predictor reported. Two independent investigators selected
citations, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We pooled the
data from all studies assessing a specific predictor, regardless of the
pituitary axis being evaluated. When more than one pituitary axis was
assessed, we used the data related to hypopituitarism or the data from
the most defective axis. When a pituitary axis was evaluated several
times, we used assessment farthest from the injury. A meta-analysis
was performed using random effect models and /? was used to evaluate
heterogeneity. Studies were considered at low risk of bias if the authors
defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, did not use voluntary sampling,
and tested > 90% of patients with proper detailed diagnostic criteria.
Results Among 13,559 citations, we included 26 studies (1,708 patients).
Increased age was associated with pituitary disorders (weighted mean
difference = 3.2, 95% Cl = 0.3 to 6.1, 19 studies, 1,057 patients, /? = 59%).
This finding was no longer significant when only considering studies
with low risk of bias. TBI severity was associated with an increased risk
of developing pituitary disorders (RR = 1.49, 1.24 to 1.77, ? = 17% for
moderate/severe vs. mild TBI; RR = 1.78, 1.09 to 2.91, = 80% for severe
vs. mild/moderate TBI), while sex was not (RR for male = 1.05, 0.98 to
1.13, 15 studies, 870 patients, /? = 0%). Among CT scan findings, only
skull fractures were associated with pituitary disorders (RR = 1.75, 1.13
to 2.70, six studies, 345 patients, ? = 47%). An insufficient number of
studies with low risk of bias assessing the association between GCS,
CT scan findings and pituitary disorders was retrieved to perform
meta-analysis.

Conclusion Age, TBI severity and skull fractures are associated with an
increased risk of pituitary disorders. Further studies are necessary to
identify additional factors that will help developing targeted screening
strategies.

Vasopressin reduces the cumulative epinephrine dose in
hypothermic swine with traumatic brain injury

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P333 (doi: 10.1186/cc12271)

Introduction Prevention of secondary neurologic injuries is paramount
for improved neurologic outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Evidence suggests that although therapeutic hypothermia (TH) lowers
intracranial pressure and attenuates secondary cerebral insults after TBI
[1], it also induces hypotension. Brief episodes of mild hypotension in
brain-injured patients can trigger secondary injuries, which have been
associated with increased mortality in patients with TBI [2]. Vasopressin
mitigates hypotension in septic shock and improves coronary perfusion
in hypothermic cardiac arrest models [3]. We hypothesized that a low-
dose vasopressin infusion may reduce the cumulative epinephrine
dose in hypothermic, brain-injured swine.

Methods Six domestic cross-bred pigs were subjected to epinephrine
infusion after general anesthesia, standardized TBI and transpulmonary
hypothermia (32°C for 48 hours). All animals received the same care,
aiming for a mean arterial pressure >60 mmHg. At hour 24, animals
received additional vasopressin infusion at 0.04 units/minute. We
measured the cumulative epinephrine dose for each animal pre
and post vasopressin infusion (Figure 1) and performed a two-
sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test, comparing the median cumulative
epinephrine doses in the two groups.

Results The median cumulative epinephrine dose in the animals that
received the vasopressin infusion was 715 mg with a 25th to 75th
interquartile range (IQR) of 320 to 930 mg. The median cumulative
epinephrine dose in the control group was 2,044 mg (IQR 1,640 to
2,344 mg). This was statistically significant (P = 0.003), based on the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

Conclusion A low-dose infusion of vasopressin can significantly
reduce vasopressor requirements and improves hemodynamics in
hypothermic, brain-injured swine. This hemodynamic stability may
improve neurological outcomes.

Introduction Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) isa major cause of death
and of severe neurologic sequelae. Long-term functional outcome
of TBI and its best timing of assessment are not well understood,
and may be evaluated too prematurely in clinical studies because of
resources required to do so without too much missing data. Hence,
we conducted a systematic review of studies in severe TBI patients
to evaluate the long-term functional outcome. We hypothesized that
functional impact measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS),
or the extended version (GOSe), may plateau after several months in
patients with severe TBI.

Methods We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled
trials and cohort studies (prospective and retrospective) in patients
with severe TBI. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central,
BIOSIS, CINAHL and Trip Database from their inception to December
2011. References of included studies were searched for additional
studies. Two reviewers independently determined study eligibility and
collected data. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of
unfavourable functional outcome (GOS 1 to 3 or GOSe 1 to 4) at 6 to
12 months, 12 to 18 months, 18 to 24 months and more than 24 months
after severe TBI. We calculated Freeman Tukey-type arcsine square-
root transformations and pooled data using random-effect models.
Heterogeneity was assessed with the /* test and sensitivity analyses
were based on a priori hypotheses.

Results In total, 4,432 studies were assessed for eligibility; 209 studies
(n = 31,540) were included. In the 188 studies using the GOS, a poor
functional outcome was observed in 56.6% (95% Cl = 54.0 to 59.1%,
P? =91%), 51.9% (95% Cl = 38.0 to 59.0%, ? = 84%), 57.0% (95% Cl = 48.2
to 55.5%, I? = 93%) and 56.9% (95% Cl = 48.2 to 65.1%, I? = 93%) of
patients at 6 to 12 months, 12 to 18 months, 18 to 24 months and
beyond 24 months, respectively. In the 18 studies using GOSe, a
poor functional outcome was observed in 62.9% of patients at 6
to 12 months (95% Cl = 55.9 to 69.2%, I? = 90%) and 54.6% at 12 to
18 months (95% Cl = 43.2 to 65.8%, I? = 90%). Heterogeneity was
present in most analyses and was not entirely explained by the planned
sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion Considering that the incidence of patients with an
unfavourable outcome remained constant at different assessments,
a follow-up of severe TBI patients longer than 12 months does not
provide incremental information. Functional outcomes measured
longer than 12 months after the injury may not be warranted in clinical
studies.

Monitoring of severe traumatic brain injury patients in UK ICUs:
a national survey

Queen's Hospital, Romford, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P335 (doi: 10.1186/cc12273)

Introduction Prevention of secondary brain injury is the cornerstone
in the management of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)
and raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Although a variety of monitoring
methods are available, due to lack of strong evidence their use varies
considerably [1]. The objective of this survey was to provide an
overview of the current practice in monitoring of patients with severe
TBI in all neuro-ICUs across the UK.

Methods The ICUs managing adult patients with severe TBI were
identified from the RAIN (Risk Adjustment In Neurocritical care) study
sites, and the Society of British Neurosurgeons. Thirty-one centers were
identified, and a telephonic survey was conducted by the investigators.
Data were collected using a single-page questionnaire containing 18
questions.

Results All 31 (100%) units used ICP monitoring and parenchymal ICP
bolt was the most widely used method (77%). Thirty (96.7%) units used
a cerebral perfusion pressure protocol to guide therapy. Twenty-eight
(90.3%) units used continuous capnography. Twelve (38.7%) units
used transcranial Doppler. Eight (25.8%) units used partial pressure of
oxygen in brain tissue. Four (12.9%) units used microdialysis. Only one
unit used jugular bulb oximetry. None of the units used near-infrared
spectrometry or optic nerve sheath diameter. Eight units (25.8%) used
a cerebral function monitor and seven (22.5%) units used the bispectral
index for guiding depth of sedation.

Conclusion This survey shows that there is no clear consensus on

what types of monitoring should be used to guide management of

patients with TBI. A CPP protocol, based on measurement of ICP, is the

most widely used method, although a recent randomized control trial

did not show any benefit in outcome [2]. Other invasive monitoring

methods, although they may help in individualized care, are still not

yet popular to due lack of strong evidence. Larger multicentre portfolio

studies are needed to establish their benefits.

Survival analysis after head injury: is a normal INR reassuring?
K Leclerc-Gagne

H6pital Sacré-Coeur de Montréal, Canada

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P336 (doi: 10.1186/cc12274)

Introduction Intracranial bleeding after head injury is an important
issue in the emergency department (ED), and elevated INR increases
this risk [1]. A retrospective study showed an association between
different levels of normal INRs (<1.6) and elevated risk of intracranial
bleeding, with a significant elevation of this risk over an INR threshold
of 1.3 [2]. The objective of the study was to evaluate clinical impact
of an INR within the normal range in patients with head trauma. We
compared mortality between patients with INR <1.3 and those with INR
21.3 to <1.6.

Methods A post hoc analysis of prospective data collected from 3,356
patients seen in a tertiary-care ED from March 2008 to February 2011.
We included patients aged 16 years old and over with an INR <1.6 and
a head CT performed within 24 hours of the trauma. We followed these
patients until December 2012, performed a chi-square test between
mortality of the two groups and calculated the hazard ratio (HR) from
survival analysis using Cox regression.

Results Patient mean age was 55.1 years (SD +23), 65% were men and
mean follow-up duration was 3.1 years (SD +0.8). A total of 115 patients
(15.9%) died during follow-up: 16 (36.4%) in the group with INR =1.3
and 99 (14.6%) in the group with INR <1.3 (P <0.001). Results showed a

significantly higher risk of death in the group with INR =1.3: HR = 2.99

(95% Cl = 1.8 to 5.1); P <0.001 (Figure 1).

Conclusion In patients with head injury and normal INR (<1.6), there

is an association between an INR =1.3 and higher risk of death.

Therefore, it would be useful to request an INR in patients presenting

with a head injury when bleeding is suspected, even in the absence of

anticoagulant.

Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death
and disability worldwide. Because mortality seriously underestimates
the impact of TBI, an outcome tool including vegetative state and
severe disability should be used. Our purpose was to study the long-
term outcome of a small cohort of severe TBI patients in Brazil.
Methods This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected
database. We included 34 consecutive adult patients admitted with
severe TBI to a tertiary private hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil between
2009 and 2011. We analyzed data on demographics, admission, clinical
scores, imaging and complications, as well as hospital mortality and
1-year extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (eGOS) of all patients.
Results We analyzed 33 patients with severe TBI. Mean age was 36 (+ 20)
years and 79% were male. All patients were mechanically ventilated
and 70% underwent ICP monitoring. Overall hospital mortality was
36% and 60% had unfavorable outcome (eGOS <4) after 1 year. In
univariate analysis, higher APACHE II scores, the presence of midriasis
and intracranial hypertension were more frequent in nonsurvivors
compared with survivors. Furthermore, older age, higher APACHE II
score and worse GCS on admission were associated with unfavorable
outcome after 1 year, as measured by eGOS <4.

Conclusion Our descriptive results suggest a significant burden of
severe TBI in a small cohort of young patients. Moreover, severity
of the primary disease, age and pupil reflexes, as well as intracranial
hypertension seemed to be associated with worse neurological
outcome.

Early respiratory deterioration predicts poor outcome after
aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage

Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P338 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12276)

Introduction Pulmonary complications are frequently occurring
medical complications after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
(aSAH) [1]. Early respiratory deterioration (ERD) may be associated
with delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) or outcome and would then be a
potential target for therapeutic interventions. We investigated whether
respiratory deterioration within the first 72 hours after admission
predicted DCI or poor outcome.

Methods We conducted a retrospective study in 137 consecutively
admitted patients with aSAH, admitted between October 2007 and
October 2011 to the ICU of a university hospital. ERD was defined as
increased need for ventilatory support the second or third day after
admission (Table 1). Elective intubation for a surgical procedure was
not included as ERD. Inclusion criteria were availability of detailed
information on respiratory status and level of support, admission
within 48 hours after hemorrhage and age =18 years. Multivariable

survival analysis was used to investigate associations of DCI, death
and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) with ERD adjusted for condition
on admission, Hijdra score, treatment of ruptured aneurysm and
pulmonary comorbidity. GOS was assessed at 3 to 6 months after the
bleed. DCI was defined as described recently [2].

Results Mean age of the patients was 55.9 (+ 12.7) and 63.5% was
female. A total 46.7% of the patients developed DCI. Mortality was
25.6%. Forty percent of the patients were classified as having ERD. ERD
was not associated with DCI (adjusted HR = 1.48; 95% Cl = 0.88 to 2.49;
P = 0.14). ERD showed a trend towards an association with mortality
(adjusted HR = 2.22; 95% Cl = 0.96 to 5.14; P= 0.06; additionally adjusted
for age, and rebleed). A clear association was found between absence
of ERD and functional outcome with ordinal logistic regression analysis
(0.98 point increase in GOS score at 3 to 6 months; 95% Cl = 0.14 to 1.82;
P=0.02; additionally adjusted for age and rebleed).

Conclusion ERD within 72 hours after admission is associated with
increased risk of poor functional outcome after aSAH, but not DCI.
Further investigations are required to assess whether prevention of
ERD may improve outcome.

Introduction Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) worsens neurological
outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
(aSAH). DCI pathogenesis is multifactorial and not completely
understood, but vasospasm plays a central role. Transcranial color-
coded duplex sonography (TCCDS) is a non-invasive bedside tool to
explore cerebral vessels, but specificity is still suboptimal. The aim
of this study was to evaluate the proximal-distal gradient of mean
cerebral blood flow velocity (CBF-V) in middle cerebral artery (MCA) as
a possible indicator of critical vasospasm.

Methods Consecutive aSAH patients (WFNS 1 to 5, age 18 to 80 years)
admitted to NeurolCU between November 2011 and September 2012
were included in this study. TCCDS was used to assess CBF-V in MCA of
both sides: we defined TCCDS vasospasm as CBF-V >120 cm/second.
Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA, 3D TOF HR) was performed to
evaluate vasospasm at early (<3 days) and delayed (7 to 10 days) time
points. When patients underwent MRA, in the same clinical conditions,
we recorded CBF-V with TCCDS at two levels: at the origin (proximal
CBF-V) and at the end (distal CBF-V) of the MCA. Then we calculated the
absolute value of proximal-distal CBF-V gradient for MCA of both sides.
We defined clinical vasospasm as the appearance of a new neurological
deficit confirmed by imaging. The relationships between the absolute
value of TCCDS CBF-V gradient and (1) TCCDS vasospasm, (2) MRA
vasospasm and (3) clinical vasospasm were explored.

$129

Results We included 26 consecutive aSAH patients (WFNS 1 to 5, age
57 + 12 years). The absolute value of MCA CBF-V gradient was higher in:
(1) vessels affected by TCCDS vasospasm when compared with vessels
not affected (63 cm/second, IR 23 to 85 and 15 cm/second IR 7 to 23
respectively, P <0.001); (2) vessels affected by MRA vasospasm when
compared with vessels not affected (43 cm/second, IR 18 to 78 and
13 cm/second IR 6 to 22, P <0.001); and (3) in patients who developed
clinical vasospasm than in patients who did not (56 cm/second IR 11
to 124 and 16 cm/second IR 8 to 30 respectively, P <0.01). Considering
only the subset of MCAs affected by MRA vasospasm, the CBF-V
gradient was higher when clinical vasospasm was also present (75 cm/
second IR 56 to 124 and 23 cm/second IR 17 to 30 respectively, P <0.05).
Conclusion Proximal-distal CBF-V gradient of MCA might be a reliable
indicator of critical vasospasm but further studies are warranted to
define threshold values and specificity in aSAH patients.

Introduction Microthrombosis has been demonstrated in early and
delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
(aSAH). Markers of coagulation activation as microparticles (MPs) are an
established risk factor for thrombosis. Our hypothesis was that levels
of microparticles might correlate with aSAH severity, early cerebral
ischemia (ECI) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI).

Methods Consecutive aSAH patients (age 18 to 80) admitted to our
department between November 2011 and September 2012 were
enrolled in the study. Total MPs (anxV+), platelet MPs (PLT-MPs, anx+/
CD41+), tissue factor MPs (TF-MPs, anx+/CD142+), and endothelial
MPs (E-MPs, anx+/CD144+) were assessed in venous blood samples.
Measurement of MPs levels were obtained at early (<3 days) and delayed
phase (7 to 10 days). Multiparameter MRI (T2; FLAIR; T1; AngioRM 3D TOF
HR; DWI) was performed to evaluate ischemic damage and vasospasm
at the same time points. Qualitative evaluation of severity of ischemic
damage was performed on DWI sequences. Levels of MPs were evaluated
comparing different groups in terms of SAH severity (World Federation
of Neurological Surgeons score or WFNS), ECI severity and occurrence of
delayed complications (vasospasm and DC)).

Results Twenty-five patients (age 57 + 12 years, WFNS 1 to 5) were
included in the analysis. Overall increased levels of MPs were observed
at early phase after aSAH when compared with controls. Contrarily
to our hypothesis, in the early phase no significant differences of
MP level were observed in WFNS 4 to 5 (n = 9) when compared with
WENS 1 to 2 (n = 16) patients. Interestingly, patients with most severe
ECI and DCI showed the highest values of MPs, but this trend did not
reach statistical significance, probably because of the small number of
patients included in the study.

Conclusion Microparticles and microthrombosis may increase the
severity of early and delayed ischemic damage after aSAH.

Introduction Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) may have deleterious
effects on cerebral metabolism and mortality after aneurysmal
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) [1,2], but its relevance has not yet
been well explored. Aims of this study are to track ICP changes after
SAH, to identify clinical factors associated with it and to explore the
relationship between ICP and outcome.

Methods A total of 116 consecutive SAH patients with ICP monitoring
were enrolled. Episodes of ICP >20 mmHg for at least 5 minutes and the
mean ICP value for every 12-hour interval were analyzed. The highest
mean ICP collected in every patient was identified. ICP values were
analyzed in relation to clinical and CT findings; 6-month outcome and
ICU mortality were also introduced in multivariable logistic models.
Results Eighty-one percent of patients had at least one episode of
elevated ICP and 36% had a highest mean ICP >20 mmHg. The number
of patients with highest mean ICP >20 mmHg or with episodes of
HICP was maximum at day 3 after SAH and decreased only after day 7.
Neurological status, aneurysmal rebleeding, amount of blood on
CT and CT ischemic lesion occurred within 72 hours from SAH were
significantly related to highest mean ICP >20 mmbg in a multivariable
model. Patients with highest mean ICP >20 mmHg showed significantly
higher mortality in ICU. However, ICP is not an independent predictor
of 6 months unfavorable outcome.
Conclusion Elevated intracranial pressure is a common complication in
the first week after SAH. It is associated with early brain injury severity
and ICU mortality.

Introduction Pituitary disorders are an often-neglected consequence
of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). We systematically
reviewed their prevalence, aiming particularly at studies with low risk
of bias.

Methods We searched Embase, MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Trip
Database, references of included studies and narrative reviews. We
included cohort studies, cross-sectional studies and RCTs published
in any language that tested the integrity of =1 pituitary axis in adults

Table 1 (abstract P342)

with aSAH. Studies including more than 50% of non-aneurismal SAH
were excluded. Studies were considered at low risk of bias if the authors
defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, avoided voluntary sampling, and
tested >90% of included patients with proper detailed diagnostic
criteria. Studies testing all pituitary axes were considered as evaluating
hypopituitarism, which was defined as the dysfunction of =1 axis.
We used a Freeman Tukey-type arcsine square-root transformation
and pooled prevalences using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effect
method. We determined the degree of heterogeneity with / values.
Results Among 12,363 citations, we included 28 studies (1,628
patients). Patients were mostly female (64%) aged 50.5 + 5.4. Sixteen
studies reported the severity of aSAH, 14 reported the procedure for
securing the aneurysm and 13 reported the location of aneurysm.
Overall, hypopituitarism was observed in 53.4% of patients at short-
term (<3 months), 36.5% at mid-term (3 to 12 months) and 34.2% at
long-term (>12 months) (Table 1). There was an insufficient number of
studies with low risk of bias to perform sensitivity analyses according
to study quality.

Conclusion The exact prevalence of pituitary disorders following aSAH
remains uncertain, mainly due to high heterogeneity and the small
number of studies with low risk of bias. However, the prevalence seems
to decrease during the recovery phase. The prevalence, risk factors and
clinical significance of pituitary disorders in aSAH will require further
rigorous evaluation.

Introduction Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage  (aSAH)
is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Although UK
Anaesthesia Guidelines advocate early coiling or clipping of the
aneurysm within the first 72 hours of admission for all grades of aSAH,
the optimal timing of treatment and whether this is linked with better
neurological long-term outcome are a subject of debate [1]. We aimed
to investigate whether the timing of the occlusion of the aneurysm
translates into better outcome.

patients were managed according to the local Guidelines for the
management of aSAH. Outcome was assessed at 3 months using the
extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) defining good recovery as a
GOSE =7 and poor outcome as GOSE <6.

Results A total of 28 patients were included within the study period.
Three patients were not expected to survive the first 24 hours and were
not included in the study. Seventeen patients were classified as good
grade aSAH (WFNS Ito Ill) and eight as poor grade (IV to V). Twenty-two
patients underwent successful coiling while the other three required
clipping due to unsuccessful coiling. We did not find any correlation
between the timing of coiling/clipping and the 3-month GOSE
(Figure 1). A total 44% of the patients had a poor 3-month GOSE while
56% had a good long-term functional outcome. The overall mortality
rate was 21%.

Conclusion Overall mortality in patients with aSAH is low when
aneurysm is treated early post rupture of aneurysm. We did not find
any correlation between the timing of occlusion of aneurysm and the
3-month functional outcome.

Introduction Early and delayed cognitive dysfunctions are an under-
studied issue after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH),
irrespective of neurological outcome. The aim of this study was to
describe early and delayed changes of cognitive functions, activities of
everyday life, and quality of life in aSAH patients.

Methods Consecutive aSAH patients admitted to our ICU between
November 2011 and September 2012 were prospectively studied.
Patients underwent neuropsychological evaluation at early (<3 days,
10 days) and delayed time points (1 month, 3 months). Patients were
tested for language, verbal fluency, short-term and long-term memory,
attention, executive functions, praxis, and neglect. Impairments in
activities of everyday life were assessed using the Activities of Daily
Living scale and the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale.
The SF-36 was used to assess the quality of life at 3 months. Since
complications of aneurysm treatment in addition to aSAH severity may
significantly affect cognitive status, patients were evaluated according
to the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons score after treatment
(WFNSpt).

$131

Results All WFNSpt 1 to 2 patients completed neuropsychological tests
at each time point. WFNSpt 3 and WFNS 4 patients were testable in 80%
and 50% of the cases respectively at early time points. WFNS 5 patients
were not testable at any time point. In all testable patients, cognitive
functions were severely impaired at early time points. At 3 months in
WENS 1 to 3 a good recovery of language deficits while only a partial
recovery of attention, memory and executive functions were observed;
at the same time point 70% of WFNS 4 patients became testable, but
they had a worse recovery of all cognitive functions. At 1 month after
SAH less than 30% of patients return to work, at 3 months approximately
50%. Despite a good recovery of everyday life activities at 3 months, for
all patients quality of life was lower than a normal population.
Conclusion Cognitive dysfunction has different time courses after
aSAH: significant deficits in different cognitive domains, worse quality
of life and difficulties in return to work persist in more than 50% of
patients at 3 months following SAH.

Introduction Stroke is a major cause of death. This study investigated
the preventative effect of a new synthetic drug on brain function in
experimentally induced ischemic stroke.

Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered aspirin (ASA),
decursinol (DA) or ASA-DA before and after ischemic insults. Brain
and neuronal damage were examined by TTC staining, PEP-CT, NeuN
immunohistochemistry and F-J B histofluorescence. Gliosis was also
observed by GFAP and iba-1 immunohistochemistry.

Results Pretreatment with 20 mg/kg, but not 10 mg/kg, of ASA-DA
protected against ischemic neuronal death and damage, and its
neuroprotective effect was much more pronounced than that of ASA
or DA alone. In addition, treatment with 20 mg/kg ASA-DA reduced the
ischemia-induced activation of astrocytes and microglia.

Conclusion Our findings indicate that ASA-DA, a new synthetic drug,
prevents against transient focal cerebral ischemia, which provides a
resource for the development of its clinical application for stroke.

Introduction Acute neurological injury is a leading cause of morbidity
and mortality in children. Global prevalence and regional disparities
of etiology, interventions, and outcomes are unknown. The aim of
this point-prevalence study was to measure the burden of pediatric
neurological injury and to describe variations in interventions and
outcomes in ICUs.

Methods One hundred and three ICUs on six continents enrolled
subjects on 4 specific days in a 1-year period. Included subjects were
between ages 7 days and 17 years who were diagnosed with acute
traumatic brain injury, stroke, cardiac arrest, central nervous system
infection or inflammation, status epilepticus, spinal cord lesion,
hydrocephalus, or brain mass. Sites completed a secure web-based
case report form that included subject and hospital demographics,
details about the neurological disease, interventions, length of stay,
and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) score (good
outcome = PCPC 1 to 3) and mortality at hospital discharge.

----$$$$----$$$$----
Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2
http://ccforum.com/supplements/17/S2

Results Of 3,113 subjects screened, 1,009 (32%) met enrollment criteria.
The mean number of subjects enrolled per site for each study day was
2.4. Most sites were dedicated pediatric ICUs with a mean number of
22 ICU beds (range 3 to 72). ICUs had resources to invasively monitor
intracranial pressure (93%), continuous electroencephalography (14%),
invasive and non-invasive brain tissue oxygenation (14% and 57%),
and somatosensory evoked potentials (39%). There were on average
11 ICU faculty and six fellows per site, and nearly one-half reported
a neurocritical care ICU team. Subjects were 58% male and 52%
white, and 60% had normal pre-admission PCPC scores (85%). Status
epilepticus and cardiac arrest (both 21%) had the highest prevalence.
Sixty-one per cent of subjects were mechanically ventilated during ICU
admission. ICU length of stay was a mean 29 days (median 43 days) and
hospital LOS was a mean 43 days (median 61 days). Survival at hospital
discharge was 87% with 58% of subjects discharged home and 17% to
inpatient rehabilitation.

Conclusion Acute neurological disease is a significant pediatric health
issue. These data suggest a vital need for increased research and
healthcare resources to assist in the challenge of improving outcomes
for these children.

Survival analysis of patients taking dabigatran who consulted an
emergency department for acute bleeding: a first alarm

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P347 (doi: 10.1186/cc12285)

Introduction The newly approved oral anticoagulant dabigatran has
no effective antidote. We therefore suspected an overall increase in
mortality in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED)
with a bleeding complication on dabigatran compared with warfarin
or aspirin.

Methods We conducted a post hoc analysis on a database of all patients
admitted to a tertiary-care ED with any kind of bleeding or suspicion
of one from March 2011 to August 2012 who were taking dabigatran,
warfarin, or aspirin. The primary endpoint was long-term survival.
Patients were censored at death or at the end of the study period
(7 December 2012). We performed a Cox proportional hazard model,
controlled for age, to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) for dabigatran
versus warfarin and one for warfarin versus aspirin. Statistical
significance was set at a = 0.05 and results are presented with 95% Cl.
Results In total, 943 patients met the inclusion criteria with a mean
follow-up period of 1 year. The mean age was 74.3 years and 50.4%
were men. A total of 108 deaths (11.5%) were recorded within the
follow-up period; eight (25%) for dabigatran compared with 44 (12.6%)
for warfarin and 56 (9.9%) for aspirin. The mortality risk for patients
on dabigatran was significantly higher than for patients on warfarin:
HR = 2.1 (95% Cl: 1.0 to 4.5), P = 0.05 after controlling for age. Aspirin
had a lower (but not statistically significant) mortality risk compared
with warfarin; HR = 0.75 (95% Cl: 0.50 to 1.14), P= 0.18 after controlling
for age.

Conclusion The results showed higher overall mortality in patients
who presented to the ED with a bleeding complication and were
taking dabigatran compared with warfarin or aspirin. Physicians
should be aware of the potential higher mortality with dabigatran over
warfarin when treating a bleeding patient. However, this was a single-
centre retrospective analysis with a small number of patients taking
dabigatran (n = 32), and further studies are needed to corroborate the
results.

Bedside anti-Xa measurement for therapeutic assessment of a
prophylactic anticoagulation regimen

Introduction Dose adjustments of low molecular weight heparin
(LMWH) based on daily anti-Xa measurement by chromogenic

$132

assay remain controversial in daily clinical practice. One of the major
obstacles is the cost of such a test. An affordable and reliable bedside
test could change practice to an individual tailored dosing of LMWH.
The aim of our study was to evaluate whether a prophylactic dose
regimen of 40 mg enoxaparine in cardiac surgical patients increases
the anti-Xa activity to the level necessary for efficient prevention of a
thromboembolic event [1]. Secondarily we tested whether there was a
reliable correlation between a bedside anti-Xa measurement compared
with a two-stage chromogenic assay at the laboratory [2].

Methods This was an open, single-centre, prospective, nonrandomized
clinical trial at a university hospital. All patients that needed
prophylactic dosing of enoxaparine after cardiac surgery were duly
informed and after giving written consent we included 44 patients with
a mean Euroscore of 1.66. The demographic specifications, medical
and surgical history of all patients were collected. Anti-Xa activity was
measured at three different points in time. We determined baseline,
peak and trough anti-Xa activity: preoperatively, and respectively
4 hours after the third dose of enoxaparine and 30 minutes before the
fourth dose. Each measurement was done with both techniques, the
two-stage chromogenic assay at the laboratory (Biophen®) and the
bedside assay (Hemochron® Jr).

Results Our dose regimen of enoxaparine achieved in one-half of
the included patients a sufficient anti-Xa activity for prevention of
thromboembolic events. One-half of the patients with insufficient anti-
Xa activity had a body mass index over 30 kg/m. Comparison of the
bedside assay with the two-stage chromogenic assay by means of the
Pearson's correlation coefficient showed correlation of the two tests if
no variables were taken into account. In the Bland-Altman analysis we
could not confirm this correlation.

Conclusion The bedside anti-Xa activity assay with a Hemochron device
tends to show some correlation with the two-stage chromogenic assay,
but insufficient to be used as an alternative, in this small but uniform
patient population. Use of a standard dosing protocol for enoxaparine
administration is prone for underdosage in post-cardiac surgery
patients and may increase postoperative morbidity.

Introduction We hypothesized that higher doses of enoxaparin would
improve thromboprophylaxis without increasing the risk of bleeding.
Critically ill patients are predisposed to venous thromboembolism,
leading to increased risk of adverse outcome [1]. Peak anti-factor
Xa (anti-Xa) levels of 0.1 to 0.4 IU/ml, 4 hours post administration of
enoxaparin, reflect adequate thromboprophylaxis for medico-surgical
patients.

Methods The sample population consisted of 78 patients, randomized
to receive subcutaneous (s.c.) enoxaparin: 40 mg x1 (control group),
versus 30 mg x2, 40 mg x2 or 1 mg/kg x1 (test groups) for a period
of 3 days. Anti-Xa activity was measured at baseline, and at 4, 12, 16
and 24 hours post administration on each day. Patients did not differ
significantly between groups.

Results On day 1 of administration, doses of 40 mg x1 and 40 mg
x2 yielded similar mean peak anti-Xa of 0.20 IU/ml and 0.17 IU/ml
respectively, while a dose of 30 mg x2 resulted in subtherapeutic
levels of anti-Xa (0.08 IU/ml). Patients receiving 1 mg/kg enoxaparin
achieved near-steady-state levels from day 1 with mean peak anti-Xa
levels of 0.34 IU/ml. Steady-state anti-Xa was achieved for all doses of
enoxaparin at day 3. At steady state, mean peak anti-Xa levels of 0.13 IU/
ml and 0.15 lU/ml were achieved with doses of 40 mg x1 and 30 mg x2
respectively. This increased significantly to 0.33 |U/ml and 0.40 IU/ml for
doses of 40 mg x2 and 1 mg/kg enoxaparin respectively (P = 0.0000)
(Figure 1). A dose of 1 mg/kg enoxaparin yielded therapeutic anti-Xa
levels for over 80% of the study period. There were no adverse effects.

Conclusion Current standard s.c. doses of 40 mg x1 enoxaparin
(Europe) or 30 mg x2 (North America) yield levels of anti-Xa thought to
be subtherapeutic for critically ill patients. A weight-based dose yielded
the best anti-Xa levels, allowed the establishment of near-steady-state
levels from the first day of enoxaparin administration, and may thus be
more appropriate, convenient, and effective. A new study using 1 mg/
kg enoxaparin s.c. with clinical endpoints has recently been approved
by the Danish Ministry of Health.

Introduction Unfractionated heparin is preferred over LMWH in
ICU patients but LMWH is used more frequently in many European
ICUs. Thromboprophylaxis with standard doses of nadroparin and
enoxaparin has been shown to result in significantly lower anti-Xa in
ICU patients when compared with medical patients [1,2].

Methods ICU patients (SAPS 44 + 16, MV, n = 44; pressors n = 32)
received 7,500 IU (Group 1, n = 25) or 5,000 IU dalteparin s.c. (Group 2,
n = 29). Twenty-nine medical patients receiving 5,000 IU dalteparin
served as controls (Group 3).

Results Group 2 had significantly lower areas under the Xa curve
(AUC) compared with Groups 1 and 3 (Table 1). Differences were not
significant between Groups 1 and 3. Peak anti-Xa activities (C_. -anti-Xa)

Conclusion In ICU patients a s.c. dose of 5,000 IU dalteparin results

in significantly lower Xa activities when compared with normal ward

patients. A s.c. dose of 7,500 IU dalteparin in ICU patients resulted in

kinetics and peak anti-Xa activities comparable with medical patients

receiving 5,000 IU dalteparin.

Introduction Anemia is very frequently encountered on the ICU.
Increased hepcidin production is one of the cornerstones of the
pathophysiology of anemia of inflammation. The first-in-class hepcidin
antagonist NOX-H94, a PEGylated anti-hepcidin L-RNA oligonucleotide,
is in development for targeted treatment of anemia of inflammation.
We investigated whether NOX-H94 prevents the inflammation-induced
serum iron decrease during experimental human endotoxemia.

Methods A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in
24 healthy young men. At T = 0 hours, 2 ng/kg E. coli endotoxin was
administered intravenously (i.v.), followed by 1.2 mg/kg NOX-H94 or
placebo i.v. at T = 0.5 hours. Blood was drawn serially after endotoxin
administration for measurements of inflammatory parameters,

cytokines, NOX-H94 pharmacokinetics, total hepcidin-25, and iron
parameters. The difference of serum iron change from baseline at
T = 9 hours was defined as the primary endpoint.

Results Endotoxin administration led to flu-like symptoms. Inflam-
matory parameters (CRP, body temperature, leucocytes, and plasma
levels of TNFa, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1RA) peaked markedly and similarly in
both treatment groups. NOX-H94 was well tolerated. Plasma concen-
trations peaked at 0.7 + 0.4 hours after the start of administration, after
which they declined according to a two-compartment model, with a
T,,, of 22.5 + 4.28 hours. In the placebo group, serum iron increased
from 19.0 + 7.6 ug/I at baseline to a peak at T = 3 hours, returned close to
baseline at T= 6 hours and decreased under the baseline concentration
at T = 9 hours, reaching its lowest point at T = 12 hours. In the NOX-H94
group, serum iron concentrations rose until T = 6 hours and then slowly
declined until T = 24 hours. From 6 to 12 hours post LPS, the serum iron
concentrations in NOX-H94-treated subjects were significantly higher
than in placebo-treated subjects (P <0.0001, ANCOVA).

Conclusion Experimental human endotoxemia induces a robust
inflammatory response and a subsequent decrease in serum iron.
Treatment with NOX-H94 had no effect on innate immunity, but
effectively prevented the inflammation-induced drop in serum iron
concentrations. These findings demonstrate the clinical potential of the
anti-hepcidin drug NOX-H94 for further development to treat patients
with anemia of inflammation.

Haemoglobin concentration on admission to intensive
care influences hospital mortality rates and length of stay:
a retrospective study

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P353 (doi: 10.1186/cc12291)

Introduction The association between haemoglobin concentrations
and mortality has been studied in patients with various comorbidities
[1,2]. This study aims to determine the association between haemo-
globin levels on admission to intensive care and patient length of stay
and mortality.

Methods A retrospective collection of data from patient admissions
to a single five-bed ICU over a 15-year period identified 5,826 patients
between April 1994 and November 2012. Patients were split into groups
according to haemoglobin concentration on admission. The data were
analysed to determine whether there was any relationship between
haemoglobin concentration at ICU admission and any of our outcome
measures (unit and hospital mortality, unit and hospital length of stay).
Results Patients with haemoglobin concentrations <10 g/dl and
>10.1 g/dl were used in mortality comparisons. Patients with a
haemoglobin concentration <10 g/dl had an increase in ICU mortality
compared with those with haemoglobin levels >10 g/dl (OR = 1.36, 95%
Cl = 1.30 to 1.71, P <0.0001). A similar difference was seen with hospital
mortality (<10 g/dl 37.7% vs. >10 g/dl 27.3%, P <0.0001). Unit length
of stay was significantly longer in patients with admission Hb <10 g/
dl (5.34 days) compared with an admission Hb >10 g/dl (4.08 days),
P <0.0001. Hospital length of stay was also significantly longer in
patients with Hb <10 g/dl versus Hb >10 g/dl (21.6 days vs. 15.5 days,
P <0.0001). There was seen to be an inverse correlation between
haemoglobin concentration and patient age (r = —0.174; P <0.0001).
Conclusion Haemoglobin concentrations <10 g/dl on admission to the
ICU are associated with an increase in ICU mortality, hospital mortality,
unit length of stay and hospital length of stay when compared with
patients admitted with haemoglobin concentrations >10 g/dl.

Introduction According to many authors, acute necrotizing pancreatitis
(ANP) still remains one of the difficult problems of abdominal surgery. The
complexity of the pathogenesis of the disease, features of the pancreas
pathomorphology, abdominal hypertension, and high mortality (30 to
70%) necessitate a search for new ways to treat this disease.

Methods The study was conducted in 44 patients with ANP, who were
divided into two groups according to type of analgesia: epidural or opioids.
Patients from the first group (n = 23) had epidural analgesia by ropivacaine
6 to 14 mg/hour during 7 to 10 days, and from the second group (n = 21)
opioid analgesia by trimeperidine 20 mg three times a day during the
same period. We monitored the level of septic and thrombohemorrhagic
complications by clinical and instrumental data, during the month after
treatment starting. The hemostatic system was evaluated using indicators
of hemoviscoelastography (Mednord-01M analyzer).

Results It was found that all patients with ANP initially have
hypercoagulation and fibrinolysis inhibition. Levels of hemostatic
disorders correlate with the level of septic complications, treatment
in the ICU, and mortality. In the first group we noted a deep vein
thrombosis, two pneumonia, seven pseudopancreatic cysts and
abscesses, two deaths and time of stay in the ICU as 15.4 days. In the
second group: three cases of deep vein thrombosis, four pneumonia, 10
pseudopancreatic cysts and abscesses, two episodes of gastroduodenal
bleeding, five deaths and time of stay in the ICU as 27.8 days.
Conclusion Using epidural anesthesia in patients with ANP reduced
the number of septic complications on 36.6%, and reduced the
mortality rate from 23.8% (second group) to 8.7% (first group). We
think that violations of blood coagulation and microcirculation are the
basis for ischemia, necrosis in tissues and septic complications. Epidural
analgesia is an effective method to decrease the level of septic and
thrombohemorrhagic complications and mortality in ANP patients.

Introduction Deep vein thrombosis of lower extremities and
pulmonary embolism occupy an important place in the structure of
postoperative morbidity and mortality.

Methods After ethics approval and informed consent, we studied the
functional state of hemostasis in a group of 57 healthy volunteers,
who were not receiving drugs affecting coagulation, and 43 patients
with postphlebothrombotic syndrome (PPTS). In the PPTS patients
we conducted baseline studies of coagulation state and daily
monitoring of dynamic changes in the functional state of hemostasis,
a comparative evaluation of performance low-frequency piezoelectric
vibration hemoviscoelastography (LPVH) and platelet aggregation test
(PAT), standard coagulation tests (SCT), and thromboelastogram (TEG).
Results We found that LPVH correlated with SCT, PAT and TEG. However,
our proposed method is more voluminous: indexes ICC (the intensity
of the contact phase of coagulation), t1 (the time for the contact
phase of coagulation), and AO (initial rate of aggregation of blood)
are consistent with PAT; indexes ICD (the intensity of coagulation
drive), CTA (a constant thrombin activity) and CP (the clot intensity of
the polymerization) are consistent with SCT and TEG. In addition, the
advantage of this method is to determine the intensity of fibrinolysis —
with the indicator IRIS (the intensity of the retraction and clot lysis).
Conclusion LPVH allows one to make a total assessment of all parts
of hemostasis: from initial viscosity and platelet aggregation to
coagulation and lysis of clots, as well as their interaction. These figures
are objective and informative, as evidenced by close correlation with
the performance of traditional coagulation methods.

prophylaxis in orthopedics or in cases of acute coronary syndromes.
The main drawback of FOND is that routine monitoring is not currently
available. This could be a problem during the management of critical
and surgical patients, especially in cases of old patients and renal failure.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of thromboelastography
(TEG) to determine the level of anticoagulation due to FOND in a
surgical population.
Methods We prospectively analyzed all patients to whom elective
major orthopedic surgery was consecutively performed in a 2-month
period. All the patients received FOND 2.5 mg in the postoperative
period according to ACCP 2012 Guidelines. Native and heparinase
(hep) TEG (Haemoscope Corporation, Niles, IL, USA) tests activated
with kaolin were performed using whole blood citrated samples
at four times: TO, before FOND administration; T1, 2 hours after
administration; T2, 17 hours after administration (half-life); T3, 24 hours
after administration. The following native and hep TEG parameters
were analyzed: reaction time (R), a angle, maximum amplitude (MA)
and coagulation index (Cl). These parameters were compared with
levels of anti-Xa. Unvariate analysis and Spearman’s test were applied
to our data.
Results Eighteen patients were analyzed. Ten patients met the
inclusion criteria. The mean R value increased from T1 to T3. The mean
R parameter was in the normal range at any phase of the study and
there was no significant differences between the R mean value at the
different phases. The lowest value of R was at T1, which coincides with
plasmatic peak concentration of FOND. This value did not correlate with
anti-Xa mean value at T1, which showed the highest value at that time.
There was significant difference between the mean native and hep R
value only at T2 (P <0.05), native and hep a angle at T3, MA and MA hep
at T2 (P<0.01) and Cl and Cl hep at T3 (P <0.02). Only the parameter MA
had significant variation over time (P <0.02).
Conclusion R represents the time necessary to thrombin formation
and in the presence of FOND we hypothesized a prolonged R time. In
our population, TEG performed with citrated kaolin-activated whole
blood was not able to detect prophylatic doses of FOND in every
phase. On the contrary, levels of anti-Xa were able to reveal the exact
pharmacokinetics of the drug. Further studies including a large number
of patients are necessary.

Introduction Coagulopathy, particularly a trend toward hyper-
coagulability and hypofibrinolysis, is common in critically ill patients
and correlates with worse outcome. Available laboratory coagulation
tests to assess fibrinolysis are expensive and time demanding. We
investigated whether a modified thromboelastography with the
plasminogen activator urokinase (UKIF-TEG) [1] may be able to evaluate
fibrinolysis in a population of critically ill patients.

Methods UKIF-TEG was performed as follows: first urokinase was
added to citrate blood to give final concentrations of 160 Ul/ml, then
thromboelastography (TEG) analysis was started after kaolin activation
and recalcification with calcium chloride. Basal TEG (no addition of
urokinase) was also performed. Fibrinolysis was determined by the
loss of clot strength after the maximal amplitude (MA), and recorded as
Ly30 (percentage lysis at 30 minutes after MA) and as Ly60 (percentage
lysis at 60 minutes after MA).

Results UKIF-TEG was performed on 17 healthy volunteers and 18
critically ill patients. Ly60 was predicted by Ly30 according to an
exponential function, so we used Ly30 as an indicator of clot lysis. Basal
TEG showed increased coagulability and a trend toward less fibrinolysis
in critically ill patients compared with healthy volunteers (reaction time

47.2 + 11.8, P <0.01). This reduction of fibrinolysis was more evident at
a urokinase concentration of 160 Ul/ml (Figure 1).

Conclusion UKIF-TEG could be a feasible point-of-care method to
evaluate fibrinolysis in critically ill patients.

Bleeding complications after central line insertions and the
relevance of pre-procedure coagulation tests and blood component
therapy

TK Kander, US Schott

Lund University, Lund, Sweden

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P358 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12296)

Introduction Bleeding complications in association with insertion of
central venous catheters are reported in 0.5 to 1.6% of cases, are rarely
fatal, but sometimes require intervention. The aim of this study was
to map pre-procedural variables at the insertion of a central venous
catheter and to investigate whether any independent variable could
be identified as an independent risk factor for bleeding complications
associated with insertion of central venous catheters.

Methods In this retrospective study, we investigated 1,737 consecutive
insertions of central venous catheters on 1,444 patients in a large
university hospital during 2009 to 2010. Pre-procedural coagulation
status, blood component use, type of catheter, insertion site, and
complications during insertion were recorded and compared with
bleeding complications documented in electronic charts.

Results No serious bleeding complications were recorded in connection
with the insertions of central venous catheters. Sixteen out of 1,769
(0.9%) insertions caused grade 2 bleeding, being defined as a bleeding
requiring prolonged compression at the insertion site. Insertion of a
large-bore central dialysis catheter was found to be an independent risk
factor for bleeding complications. Neither conventional coagulation
tests nor accidental arterial puncture or the number of needle passes
could predict bleeding complications in this study.

Conclusion This retrospective study shows that serious bleeding
complications in association with central line insertion are uncommon
and that insertion of dialysis catheter is an independent risk factor
for mild bleeding complications. Coagulopathy, measured with
conventional coagulation tests, is not an independent risk factor for
bleeding complication at insertion of central venous catheters.

Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2
http://ccforum.com/supplements/17/S2

Methods We performed a randomized, double-blind study in 37
patients who underwent cesarean section. Patients were divided into
two groups: the first group (n = 19) received preoperative (30 minutes
before operation) tranexamic acid 10 mg/kg; the second group (n = 18)
received preoperative placebo. The condition of hemostasis was
monitored by haemoviscoelastography.

Results All patients included in the study before surgery had moderate
hypercoagulation and normal fibrinolysis: increasing the intensity of
clot formation (ICF) to 11.4% compared with normal rates; the intensity
of the retraction and clot lysis (IRCL) was 16.45 + 1.40 in both groups.
At the start of the operation in patients (Group 1), ICF decreased by
9.7% (P <0.05), and IRCL decreased by 27.6% (P <0.05) compared with
preoperatively. In Group 2, there was ICF decrease by 8.8% (P <0.05), and
IRCL increase by 11.4% (P <0.05) compared with preoperatively. At the
end of the operation, the condition of hemostasis in both groups came
almost to the same value —- moderate hypocoagulation, depressed
fibrinolysis. In both groups there were no thrombotic complications.
Intraoperative blood loss in the first group was 300 + 40.5 and in the
second was 500 + 60.6.

Conclusion Using of tranexamic acid before surgery significantly reduces
intraoperative blood loss by 60%, without thrombotic complications.

In vitro correction of hypothermic and dilutive crystalloid and
colloid rotational thromboelastography-monitored coagulopathy
with fibrinogen and factor XIII

D Winstedt, O Thomas, US Schott

Lund University, Lund, Sweden

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P360 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12298)

Introduction Rotational thromboelastography (ROTEM) can detect
dilutive and hypothermic effects on coagulation and evaluate
corrective treatments. The aim of this in vitro study was to study
whether fibrinogen concentrate alone or combined with factor XIll
could reverse colloid-induced and crystalloid-induced coagulopathies
in the presence and absence of hypothermia.

Methods Citrated venous blood from 10 healthy volunteers was
diluted by 33% using 130/0.42 hydroxyethyl starch or Ringer’s acetate.
ROTEM was used to evaluate the effect of addition of either fibrinogen
concentrate corresponding to 4 g/70 kg, or this fibrinogen dose
combined with factor XIII equivalent to 20 IU/kg. Blood was analyzed at
33 or 37°C with ROTEM ExTEM and FibTEM reagents.

Results A significant dilutive response was shown in both groups:
hypocoagulation was greater in the starch group. Hypothermia
lengthened the following: ExTEM clotting time (CT), clot formation
time and a angle; FibTEM maximal clot formation (MCF). Irrespective
of temperature, fibrinogen overcorrected Ringer's acetate’s effects on
all ROTEM parameters and partially reversed starch’s effects on ExTEM
CT and FibTEM MCF. FibTEM demonstrated that factor XIII provided an
additional procoagulative effect in the Ringer’s acetate group at both
temperatures but not the starch group. The only ExTEM parameter to
be improved by addition of factor XIII was MCF at 33°C.

Conclusion ROTEM shows that fibrinogen concentrate can reverse
dilutive coagulation defects induced by colloid and crystalloid at both
33 and 37°C. Some additional reversal was provided by factor XIll:
higher doses of both fibrinogen and factor XIII may counteract starch’s
effects on clot structure.

Dose-response of fibrinogen and factor XIII concentrate for
correcting albumin-induced coagulopathy

US Schott, DW Winstedt, JH Hanna

Lund University, Lund, Sweden

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P361 (doi: 10.1186/cc12299)

Introduction Natural colloid albumin induces a lesser degree of
dilutional coagulopathy than synthetic colloids. Fibrinogen concentrate
has emerged as a promising strategy to treat coagulopathy, and factor
XIII (FXIII) works synergistically with fibrinogen to correct coagulopathy
following haemodilution with crystalloids. Objectives were to examine
the ability of fibrinogen and FXIII concentrates to reverse albumin-
induced dilutional coagulopathy.

$136

Methods High and low concentrations of both fibrinogen and FxXIll
were used to reverse coagulopathy induced by 1:1 dilution in vitro with
5% albumin of blood samples from healthy volunteers, monitored by
rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM).

Results Haemodilution with albumin significantly attenuated EXTEM
maximum clot firmness (MCF), a angle (AA), clotting time (CT) and
clot formation time (CFT), and FIBTEM MCF (P <0.001). Following
haemodilution, both doses of fibrinogen significantly corrected all
ROTEM parameters (P <0.02), except the lower dose did not correct
AA. Compared with the lower dose, the higher dose of fibrinogen
significantly improved FIBTEM MCF and EXTEM MCF, AA and CFT
(P <0.001). The lower dose of FXIII did not significantly correct any of
the ROTEM parameters, and the high dose only improved EXTEM CT
(P = 0.004). All combinations of high/low concentrations of fibrinogen/
FXIII significantly improved all ROTEM parameters examined (P <0.001).
Fibrinogen concentration generally had a greater effect on each
parameter than did FXIII concentration; the best correction of ROTEM
parameters was achieved with high-dose fibrinogen concentrate and
either low-dose or high-dose FXII.

Conclusion Fibrinogen concentrate successfully corrected initiation,
propagation and clot firmness deficits induced by haemodilution with
albumin, and FXIIl synergistically improved fibrin-based clot strength.

Introduction Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) remains the leading
cause of maternal mortality. After OCS introduction in our north of
France tertiary-care obstetric unit, the consecutive cohort of severe
PPH was collected prospectively and compared regarding the use of
lOCS or not.

Methods A case-control prospective open-label study comparing the
management and outcome of a consecutive cohort of 324 severe PPHs
in elective and emergency hemorrhagic caesarean sections (CS) over
3 years.

Results l1OCS was used in 70 severe PPHs and 254 severe PPH controls
were managed without IOCS. Placenta accreta can be selected as
the best indication for RBC restitution. In the 1,500 to 3,000 ml PPH,
allogeneic transfusion was decreased in the IOCS group: 17.6 versus
56.3% (P = 0.006); PRBC: 0 (0 to 3) versus 3 (0 to 6) (P = 0.045). lOCS
spared 87 blood bank PRBC (17,374 ml); that is, 24.2% of the total
transfusion need. No amniotic fluid embolism has been observed in
the group with IOCS whereas one case appeared in the control group
without IOCS.

Conclusion Regarding the literature [1-4] and our study, IOCS could be
used safely in PPH during CS. A leukocyte filter for retransfusion has
been recommended and Rhesus isoimmunization must be precluded
and monitored by repeated fetal RBC testing.

bleeding with the use of a protamine infusion and an abolishment of
heparin rebound [1]. The aim of this study was to see whether the use
of postoperative protamine infusions in our cardiac ITU was associated
with a reduction in heparin rebound and blood loss.

Methods Data from 240 cardiac surgery patients were retrospectively
analysed. Of these, 157 had routine management with a bolus of
protamine to correct the activated clotting time and then expectant
management of subsequent bleeding, and 47 had the same but also
a protamine infusion of 10 to 80 mg/hour for between 3 and 8 hours
postoperatively. Blood loss was measured at 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours. In
all, excessive bleeding was investigated using thromboelastography
(TEG). Rebound heparinisation was determined by a ratio of R-times
(heparinase/plain) <0.8. The Mann-Whitney U test and the chi-squared
test were used to assess statistical significance.

Results There was no significant difference in blood loss between the
two groups. Blood loss at 1 hour in the infusion and non-infusion group
was 145 and 88 ml, respectively (P = 0.06); at 6 hours: 450 and 392 ml
(P = 0.5); at 12 hours: 620 and 595 ml (P = 0.62); and at 24 hours: 971
and 872 ml (P = 0.12). There was also no significant difference in those
getting heparin rebound with 40% in the infusion group and 47% in
the non-infusion group (P = 0.54).

Conclusion Unlike Teoh and colleagues [1], we did not find an
advantage in using protamine infusions. That there were still cases
of heparin rebound in the infusion group suggests that the infusion
was not as effective as expected and/or the dose was inadequate.
However, previous studies assessed heparin rebound using isolated
clotting parameters [1,2]. Here, we used TEG. As TEG measures the
thrombodynamic properties of whole blood coagulation, perhaps it is
a more reliable indicator of heparin activity? As a retrospective study,
there are limitations; namely, the nonstandardised management of the
patients and the potential bias in the anaesthetists’ selection of patients
for an infusion. This group may be inherently higher risk for bleeding.
However, heparin rebound is common and protamine is a simple,
relatively safe and low-cost intervention compared with transfusion
and so further study is needed.

Introduction The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a
restrictive strategy of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was superior to
a liberal one for reducing mortality and severe clinical complications
among patients undergoing major cancer surgery.

Methods The trial was designed as a phase Ill, randomized, controlled,
parallel-group, superiority trial. The inclusion criteria were adult patients
with cancer who were undergoing major abdominal surgery requiring
postoperative care in an ICU. The patients were randomly allocated to
treatment with either a liberal RBC transfusion strategy (transfusion
when hemoglobin levels decreased below 9 g/dl) or a restrictive RBC
transfusion strategy (transfusion when hemoglobin levels decreased
below 7 g/dl). The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of death
or severe complications. The patients were monitored for 30 days.
Results A total of 1,521 patients were screened for eligibility and 248
met the inclusion criteria. After exclusions for medical reasons or a
lack of consent, 198 patients were included in final analysis, with 101
allocated to the restrictive group and 97 to the liberal group. The

$137

primary composite endpoint - all-cause mortality, cardiovascular
complications, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury
requiring renal replacement therapy, septic shock or reoperation at
30 days - occurred in 19.6% of the patients in the liberal strategy group
and in 35.6% in the restrictive group (P = 0.012). The liberal strategy
group had a significantly lower 30-day mortality rate as compared with
the restrictive group (8.2% (95% Cl, 4.2 to 15.4%) vs. 22.8% (95% Cl, 15.7
to 31.9%), respectively, P = 0.005). The occurrence of cardiovascular
complications was lower in the liberal group than in the restrictive
group (5.2% (95% Cl, 2.2 to 11.5%) vs. 13.9% (95% Cl, 8.4 to 21.9%),
respectively, P = 0.038). The restrictive strategy group had a higher 60-
day mortality rate as compared with the liberal group (23.8% (95% Cl,
16.5 to 32.9%) vs. 11.3% (95% Cl, 6.5 to 9.2%), respectively, P = 0.022).
Conclusion The liberal RBC transfusion strategy with a hemoglobin
trigger of 9 g/dl was associated with fewer major postoperative
complications in patients undergoing major cancer surgery compared
with the restrictive strategy.

Introduction Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is associated with
morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Congenital cardiac
surgeries are associated with high rates of bleeding and consequently
with high rates of allogeneic transfusion. We aimed to evaluate the
association of transfusion with worse outcomes in children undergoing
cardiac surgery.

Methods We performed a prospective cohort study of 205 patients
undergoing cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease. We
recorded baseline characteristics, RACHS-1 score, intraoperative data,
transfusion requirement and severe postoperative complications as
need for reoperation, acute kidney injury, arrhythmia, severe sepsis,
septic shock, bleeding, stroke, and death during 30 days. We performed
univariate analysis using baseline, intraoperative and postoperative
variables. Selected variables (P <0.10) were included in a forward
stepwise multiple logistic regression model to identify predictive
factors of a combined endpoint including 30-day mortality and severe
complications.

Results One hundred and thirty-six patients (66.3%) were exposed
to RBC transfusion. In the intraoperative room, 63.4% of patients
received at least one RBC unit, and in the ICU, 11.2% of children were
transfused. From all patients, 66 (32.1%) presented the combined
endpoint. Patients with complications had higher RACHS-1 score, were
younger (69 months (0 to 137) vs. 73 months (37 to 138), P <0.001),
had a lower weight (13 kg (3 to 23) vs. 20 kg (12 to 36), P <0.001), a
longer time of surgery (475 minutes (410 to 540) vs. 353 (275 to 433),
P <0.001), a longer duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (205 minutes
(175 to 235) vs. 106 minutes (73 to 123), P = 0.003), a lower SVO, at
the end of surgery (59% (IQR 39 to 80) vs. 78% (71 to 83), P <0.001), a
higher arterial lactate at the end of surgery (6.9 mmol/l (4.3 to 9.2) vs.
2.7 mmol/I (73 to 123), P = 0.003), a lower intraoperative hematocrit
(26.2 + 5.6% vs. 29.5 + 6% (P <0.001)) and a lower hematocrit at the end
of surgery (33.4 + 6.7% vs. 36.9 + 6.9% (P <0.001)) as compared with
patients without complications. Patients with complications were more
exposed to RBC transfusion in the intraoperative room (75% vs. 57%,
P=0.011) and in the ICU (21% vs. 6.4%, P= 0.002). In an adjusted model
of logistic regression, RBC transfusion is an independent risk factor of
combined endpoint (OR 4.25 (95% Cl, 1.359 to 13.328), P= 0.013).
Conclusion Blood transfusion after pediatric cardiac surgery is a risk
factor for worse outcome including 30-day mortality. Avoiding blood
transfusion must be a goal of best postoperative care.

surgery

Introduction Cardiac surgeries are associated with high rates of
bleeding and consequently with high rates of allogeneic transfusion.
Patients with left ventricular dysfunction usually present a higher
incidence of complications after cardiac surgery, including low output
syndrome and organ dysfunction. It is a matter of controversy whether
this subgroup of patients need higher hemoglobin levels to optimize
oxygen delivery. We aimed to evaluate the association of transfusion
with worse outcomes in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.
Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in 215 patients
undergoing cardiac surgery, presenting ejection fraction <35%. We
recorded baseline characteristics, intraoperative data, transfusion
requirement and severe postoperative complications as need for
reoperation, acute kidney injury, arrhythmia, severe sepsis, septic
shock, bleeding, stroke, and death during 30 days. We performed
univariate analysis using baseline, intraoperative and postoperative
variables associated with severe postoperative complications. Selected
variables (P <0.10) were included in a forward stepwise multiple logistic
regression model to identify predictive factors of a combined endpoint
including 30-day mortality and severe complications.

Results Two hundred and fifteen patients were included in the study.
The mean ejection fraction was 31%. From all patients, 129 (54.4%)
presented the combined endpoint. The incidence of RBC transfusion
was higher in the group with complications compared with the
group without complications both intraoperative and postoperative,
P <0.001. Patients with complications were older, had lower initial
hemoglobin levels and had higher EuroSCORE. At multivariate analysis,
age (OR = 1.07, 95% Cl = 1.013 to 1.137, P = 0.016) and perioperative
RBC transfusion (OR = 7.78, 95% Cl = 2.13 to 28.41, P = 0.002) were
independent predictors of severe postoperative complications after
cardiac surgery.

Conclusion In patients with left ventricular dysfunction, red blood
transfusion after cardiac surgery is a risk factor for worse outcome
including 30-day mortality.

Defining the need for a massive transfusion in severe blunt
traumatic patients

Introduction We do not have enough criteria to make a judgment
of the need for a massive transfusion (MT) in severe blunt traumatic
patients. As a scoring system to predict the need for a MT, we usually
use the Assessment Blood Consumption score (ABCs) and/or the
Trauma-Associated Severe Hemorrhage score (TASHs). However, for
these scoring systems, the procedure is slightly complicated. The aim
of this study was to establish a predictor of a MT using coagulation or
fibrinolysis markers.

Methods A retrospective analysis of MT was conducted in patients
with severe blunt traumatic injury, which was defined as Injury Severity
Score (ISS) of 16 or more admitted to the ICU between 1 June 2009
and 31 December 2010. Blood samples were collected from patients
immediately after arriving at our level | trauma center. We defined
the patients who received more than 10 unit packed red blood cells
(PRBCs) within the first 24 hours as a MT group and who received less
than 9 units PRBCs as a non-MT group. After the demographic data,
number of units of PRBCs and the need for massive transfusions were
recorded and analyzed in each groups, we compared data between
two groups.

Results There were 114 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Fifty
patients received blood transfusions (43.9%; 50/114). There were 27

$138

patients in the MT group (23.7%; 27/114) and 87 in the non-MT group.
The MT group was significantly higher in the ratio of females (P <0.001),
ISS (P <0.01), PT-INR (P <0.001), APTT (P <0.05), ABCs (P <0.001) and
TASHs (P <0.001) than in the on-MT group. On the other hand, the
MT group was significantly lower in Ps (P <0.05) and fibrinogen
level (P <0.001) than the non-MT group. In the receiver operating
characteristics (ROC) analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) to
distinguish a MT was the highest for TASHs (0.831, P <0.001), followed
by fibrinogen (0.758, P <0.001), and ABCs (0.732, P <0.001). Fibrinogen
was only a predictor of a MT without a scoring system such as ABCs and
TASHs, and the optimal cutoff value was 205 mg/dl.

Conclusion We found that the level of fibrinogen was the most
valuable predictor of a MT in the coagulation or fibrinolysis markers.
It is certain that the level of fibrinogen at admission was not as useful
as the TASHs about predicting a MT in this study. Whereas the scoring
systems require the assessment of several factors, the measurement
of fibrinogen is simple, easy and quick. We strongly suggest that the
level of fibrinogen will be a useful predictor of a MT at in severe blunt
traumatic patients.

Introduction Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are frequent in critically
ill children. Their benefits are clear in several situations. However,
issues surrounding their safety have emerged in the past decades. It is
important to identify the potential complications associated with RBC
transfusions, in order to evaluate their risk-benefit ratio better.
Methods A single-center prospective observational study of all
children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) over a
1-year period. The variables possibly related to RBC transfusions were
identified before the study was initiated, and their presence was
assessed daily for each child. In transfused cases (TCs), a variable was
considered as a possible outcome related to the transfusion only if it
was observed after the first transfusion.

Results During the study period, 913 admissions were documented,
843 of which were included in the study. Among them, 144 (17%) were
transfused. When comparing TCs with nontransfused cases (NTCs),
the odds ratio (OR) of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction
syndrome (NPMODS) was 2.39 (95% Cl = 1.58 to 3.62, P <0.001). This
association remained statistically significant in the multivariate analysis
for children with admission PRISM score <5 (OR = 2.41, 95% Cl = 1.08 to
5.37, P= 0.032). TCs were ventilated longer than NTCs (14.1 + 32.6 days
vs. 4.3 + 9.6 days, P <0.001). This difference was still significant after
adjustment using a Cox model. Moreover, we observed an adjusted
dose-effect relationship between RBC transfusions and length of
mechanical ventilation. The PICU length of stay was significantly
increased for TCs (12.4 + 26.2 days vs. 4.9 + 10.2 days, P <0.001), even
after multivariate adjustment (hazard ratio of PICU discharge for TCs:
0.61, 95% Cl = 0.5 to 0.74, P <0.001). We also observed an adjusted
dose-effect relationship between RBC transfusions and PICU length of
stay. The paired analysis for comparison of pre-transfusion and post-
transfusion values showed that the arterial partial pressure in oxygen
was significantly reduced after the first transfusion (mean difference
42.8 mmHg, 95% Cl = 27.2 to 58.3, P <0.001). The paired analysis also
showed an increased proportion of renal replacement therapy, while
the proportions of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock did not differ.
Conclusion RBC transfusions were associated with prolonged
mechanical ventilation and prolonged PICU stay. The risk of NPMODS
was increased in some transfused children. Moreover, our study
questions the ability of stored RBCs to improve oxygenation in critically
ill children. These results should help to improve transfusion practice
in the PICU.

Introduction Microcirculatory alterations during sepsis impair tissue
oxygenation, which may be further worsened by anemia. Blood
transfusions proved not to restore O, delivery during sepsis [1]. The
impact of storage lesions and/or leukocyte-derived mediators in red
blood cell (RBC) units has not yet been clarified [2]. We compared
the effects of leukoreduced (LR) versus nonLR packed RBCs on
microcirculation and tissue oxygenation during sepsis.

Methods A prospective randomized study. Twenty patients with
either sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock requiring RBC transfusion
randomly received nonLR (Group 1, n= 10) or LR (Group 2, n = 10) fresh
RBCs (<10 days old). Before and 1 hour after transfusion, microvascular

density and flow were assessed with sidestream dark-field imaging
sublingually. Thenar tissue O, saturation (StO,) was measured
using near-infrared spectroscopy and a vascular occlusion test was
performed.

Results The De Backer score (P = 0.02), total vessel density (P = 0.08),
perfused vessel density (P = 0.04), proportion of perfused vessels
(P = 0.01), and microvascular flow index (P = 0.04, Figure 1) increased
only in Group 2. The StO, upslope (Figure 2) during reperfusion
increased in both groups (P <0.05). In Group 1 the baseline StO, and
StO, downslope during ischemia increased, probably reflecting a lower
O, consumption.

Conclusion Unlike nonLR RBCs, the transfusion of fresh LR RBCs seems
to improve microvascular perfusion and might help to restore tissue
oxygenation during sepsis.

Introduction Obstetric haemorrhage remains a leading cause
of maternal mortality and severe morbidity. Cardiovascular and
haemostatic physiology alters in pregnancy and massive transfusion
protocols have been implemented for obstetric haemorrhage based
on limited evidence. The objective of this study was to examine the
pattern and rate of blood products used in massive transfusion for
obstetric haemorrhage in a tertiary obstetric hospital.

Methods Massive transfusion was defined as 5 or more units of red
blood cells within 4 hours in accordance with the Australian Massive
Transfusion Registry definition. Following ethics approval, all cases
filling this criterion were identified in the hospital’s birthing and blood
bank systems. Data were extracted from the medical histories and
analysed using SPSS. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results Twenty-eight women in three years (2009 to 2011) underwent
a massive transfusion for obstetric haemorrhage, with nine receiving
more than 10 units of RBCs in 24 hours. Eleven (39%) were admitted to
the ICU and 11 underwent a hysterectomy, of which six were admitted
to the ICU. The median estimated blood loss was 4,335 ml (IQR 3,000
to 5,000). Median blood product delivery was RBC 8 units (IQR 6 to 13);
FFP 4 units (IQR 4 to 8); platelets 4 units (IQR 0 to 8) and cryoprecipitate
3 units (IQR 0 to 10). One-half of the women received the first four units
of RBCs in less than 34 minutes. Other blood products were started
a median of 49 minutes, 44 minutes and 75 minutes after the RBC
transfusion commenced, respectively. Eight women had a fibrinogen
level <0.8 g/l on the initial coagulation test during the haemorrhage.
The remaining 20 women had a median fibrinogen level of 3.7 g/I (IQR
3.15 to 4.9). There was no difference in the transfusion of RBCs (P= 0.20),
FFPs (P= 0.96) and platelets (P = 0.48) in women who showed an initial
low fibrinogen and those who did not, although there was a difference
in the number of units of cryoprecipitate (P <0.05). The median lowest
Hb during the haemorrhage was 66 g/I (IQR 51 to 80) and median
discharge Hb was 103 g/I (IQR 96 to 113). No blood product reaction
was noted and there was one death.

Conclusion Massive transfusion for obstetric haemorrhage involved
rapid blood product administration with no consistent pattern in the
ratio of products administered.

was undertaken to investigate whether the practice of packed red cell

(PRC) transfusions in the ICU was in accordance with the best clinical
evidence. A number of studies, most notably the TRICC study [2], have
shown that indications for ICU blood transfusions are a haemoglobin
(Hb) level of <7 g/dl or evidence of acute haemorrhage [3]. These
criteria were therefore employed.

Methods This study prospectively examined episodes of PRC unit
transfusions over a 2-month period in the ICU of a large level 1 trauma
centre and a tertiary cardiac unit. The number of PRC units transfused
in each episode was recorded by nurses, along with the proposed
indication and concurrent Hb level. The data were analysed to assess
the number of transfusions administered contrary to the guidelines,
along with the average Hb level at which a PRC unit was transfused and
the average number of units administered per episode.

Results A total 175 units of PRC were transfused in the ICU, over
105 episodes during the 2-month period (excluding immediately
postoperative transfusions). Ninety-four units (53.7%) administered in
64 transfusion episodes (61.0%) occurred contrary to the guidelines.
In 89.3% of these cases the recorded reason for transfusion was an
apparently low Hb level. The median (IQR (range)) Hb level at which
patients were transfused: within guidelines was 6.9 g/dl (6.6 to 7.7 (4.8
to 13.9)); within guidelines, excluding cases of acute blood loss, was
6.6 g/dl (6.5 to 6.8 (5.5 to 6.9)); and outside the guidelines was 7.7 g/dl
(7.4 to 8.2 (7.0 to 9.7)). One unit of PRC was transfused in 57 episodes
(54.3%), 2 units of PRC were transfused in 36 episodes (34.3%), and 3 to
6 units were transfused in 12 episodes (11.4%), with two-thirds of the
latter due to acute haemorrhage.

Conclusion Our results indicate a liberal transfusion threshold
currently exists in the ICU. Patients are frequently receiving excessive
PRC transfusions for Hb levels above the recommended concentration.
In the 2-month study period, these were associated with a cost of
approximately £12,220. We recommend increased staff awareness of
the guidelines to reduce the number of unnecessary transfusions. This
would decrease exposure of ICU patients to unnecessary risks of blood
transfusion, reduce cost of treatment and help to preserve a valuable
resource.

Introduction Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) has a
high incidence in critically ill and surgical patients and contributes
to adverse outcome, while specific therapy is absent. Recently it was
demonstrated that complement activation plays a pivotal role in TRALI.
We aimed to determine whether a C1 inhibitor is beneficial in a two-hit
mouse model of antibody-mediated TRALI.

Methods BALB/c mice were primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, from
E. coli 0111:B4) that was administered intraperitoneally in a dose of
0.1 mg/kg, after which TRALI was induced by injecting MHC-I antibody
against H2Kd (IlgG2a,k) at a dose of 2 mg/kg. Mice infused with PBS or
LPS served as controls. Concomitantly, mice infused with the MHC-I
antibody were treated with C1 inhibitor (Cetor®; Sanquin, Amsterdam,
the Netherlands) in a dose of 400 IU/kg intravenously. After infusion,
mice were mechanically ventilated with a lung-protective pressure-
controlled mode for 2 hours and then sacrificed, after which a
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was done. Statistics were analyzed by
one-way ANOVA, values expressed as mean and standard deviation.
Results Injection of LPS and MHC-I antibodies resulted in TRALI,
indicated by increased levels of protein in the BAL fluid, wet/dry
ratios and levels of KC, MIP-2 and IL-6. C1 inhibitor Cetor® significantly
reduced total protein in BAL fluid from 792 (169) to 421 (230) ug/ml
(P <0.001) and tended to reduce the wet/dry ratio from 5.3 + 0.3 to

4.9 + 0.5 (P = 0.09). Cetor® also reduced BALF levels of MIP-2 from 214
(54) to 127 (22) pg/ml (P <0.01). KC and IL-6 levels were not affected.
Conclusion In a model of antibody-mediated TRALI, C1 inhibitor
attenuated pulmonary inflammation. C1 inhibition may be a potential
beneficial intervention in TRALI.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P373 (doi: 10.1186/cc12311)

Introduction Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a
syndrome that presents as a sudden onset of respiratory distress 6
hours after transfusion of blood products. The diagnosis is based on
clinical and radiographic findings. Particularly at risk for TRALI are
cardiac surgery patients. However, specific patient risk factors and
data on outcome are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to
investigate incidence, risk factors and outcome of TRALI in cardiac
surgical patients on cardiopulmonary bypass.

Methods All thoracic surgery patients from a university hospital in the
Netherlands of 18 years and older admitted to the ICU from January
2009 until December 2011 were screened. Included patients were
observed during surgery and the first 24 hours on the ICU for the onset
of possible TRALI. The Canadian Consensus Conference TRALI definition
was used. Two independent physicians blinded to the predictor
variables scored the chest radiographs for the onset of bilateral
interstitial abnormalities on 2K monitors. When interpretation differed,
chest radiographs were reviewed by a third physician to achieve
consensus. The European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation
(EURO score) and the American Association of Anesthesiology (ASA)
were scored before surgery. By calculating the Acute Physiology and
Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and IV scores the severity of
illness was determined on arrival in the ICU.

Results In total, 1,787 cardiac surgical patients were included. A total of
19 (1.1%) patients developed TRALI within 24 hours following surgery.
Patients developing TRALI were older compared with patients not
developing TRALI, mean age respectively 71 and 65 years (P = 0.035).
Furthermore, patients developing TRALI had higher APACHE II, APACHE
lV, EURO and ASA score (P = 0.000, P = 0.000, P = 0.000 and P = 0.37).
Compared with patients not developing TRALI, patients developing
TRALI had a longer cardiopulmonary bypass time. Of the 19 patients
developing TRALI, four patients (21.1%) died during ICU stay, in total six
patients (31.6%) died during hospital stay. Patients developing TRALI
were ventilated longer and had a longer ICU and hospital stay.
Conclusion Older age, higher APACHE II, IV, EURO and ASA scores and
a longer time on cardiopulmonary bypass and ventilation time are risk
factors for the development of TRALI. The ICU and hospital stay are
longer, and the prognosis is bad for patients developing TRALI.

Albumin-induced coagulopathy is less severe and more
effectively reversed with fibrinogen concentrate than is synthetic
colloid-induced coagulopathy

DW Winstedt, JH Hanna, US Schott

Lund University, Lund, Sweden

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P374 (doi: 10.1186/cc12312)

Introduction Volume resuscitation is essential to restore normovolemia
during hemorrhagic shock, burns and sepsis. However, synthetic
colloids cause dilutional coagulopathy. The aims were to determine
whether the natural colloid albumin induces a lesser degree of
coagulopathy compared with synthetic colloids, and the comparative
effectiveness of fibrinogen concentrate to reverse coagulopathy
following dilution with these solutions.

Methods Rotational thromboelastometry-based tests were used
to examine coagulation parameters in samples from 10 healthy
volunteers, in undiluted blood and samples diluted 1:1 with saline,

Ringer's acetate, hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4, buffered HES
130/0.4, 3% dextran 60, 6% dextran 70 or 5% albumin. Samples were
analyzed before and after addition of 2 mg/ml fibrinogen concentrate.
Results EXTEM maximum clot firmness (MCF), clot formation time
(CFT) and a angle (AA) decreased significantly upon dilution with
all colloid solutions (P <0.001), although a significantly greater
coagulopathic effect was seen for samples diluted with synthetic
colloid solutions versus albumin (P <0.001). A significant reduction in
the platelet component of clot strength (EXTEM MCF — FIBTEM MCF)
was seen for samples diluted with synthetic colloids (P <0.001) but
not albumin (P = 0.10). Following addition of fibrinogen, FIBTEM MCF,
EXTEM MCF and EXTEM AA were significantly higher, and EXTEM CFT
was significantly shorter in samples diluted with albumin versus those
treated with HES or dextran (P <0.001).

Conclusion Hemodilution using albumin induced a lesser degree of
coagulopathy compared with the synthetic colloids HES and dextran.
In addition, albumin-induced coagulopathy was more effectively
reversed following addition of fibrinogen concentrate compared with
coagulopathy induced by synthetic colloids.

Introduction Fluid resuscitation is widely practiced in treating sepsis.
Comparative assessment of the different fluid modalities is hampered
by a paucity of direct trials. We present a network meta-analysis for
assessing the relative effectiveness of two fluid treatments in sepsis
when they have not been compared directly in a randomized trial but
have each been compared with a common treatment.

Methods A systematic review of trials sepsis yielded 13 trials for
assessment in network meta-analysis. The indirect comparison between
albumin, HES and crystalloid was conducted using Bayesian methods
for binomial likelihood, fixed-effects network meta-analysis with a
Monte Carlo Gibbs sampling method. Studies in septic patients with
crystalloid as a reference treatment compared with any formulation of
the colloid treatments albumin or HES were included, as were direct
head-to-head trials between the two colloids.

Results Odds ratios between the different treatments were obtained
(Figure 1). Ranking the interventions [1] demonstrated that albumin
ranked highest in lowering mortality at a 96.4% probability compared
with 3.6% and 0.01% for crystalloid and HES, respectively.

Conclusion Albumin as a fluid therapy in sepsis is associated with the
lowest mortality of the three modalities studied.

Assessing the economic impact of catheter-related bloodstream
infections when switching from open to closed system delivery of
human albumin solutions in ICUs

F Axelsen', P Riss?

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P376 (doi: 10.1186/cc12314)

Introduction Hospital-acquired infections create a significant burden
to the healthcare system. To understand the economic impact, a model
was developed to assess the cost of differences in catheter-related
bloodstream infections (BSI) in ICUs based on either closed or open
albumin systems.

Methods A model was developed with the aim of showing the
economic consequences of differences between intravenous (i.v.)
infusions of albumin via open or closed infusion containers. The model
took a healthcare perspective in the UK. The impact of central venous
catheter-related BSI was evaluated. The model took differences in
BSI rates and the associated cost consequences for the hospital into
account. The model bases on the evidence that closed system delivery
helps to reduce the risk of external contamination, which decreases the
BSI rate and reduces overall mortality [1-3]. We assessed the total costs
using public list prices and literature. The model assumes that infection
rates for using open and closed albumin delivery systems are similar to
any other closed or open nonalbumin i.v. fluid delivery system used in
the ICU. The model looks at reduction in central-line-associated BSI and
the potential cost saving of this reduction.

Results The economic model shows the potential cost saving by
switching from open to closed albumin administration systems. It is
measured in occurrence of BSI in the ICU, estimated occurrence of BSI
in the albumin population and incidence of overall mortality in the ICU
and cost of BSI per albumin patient. Finally, the model describes the
potential cost savings by switching to a closed system. Using closed
albumin delivery systems may overall provide a cost saving for the
hospital and healthcare sector. Assuming 800 patients treated in an ICU
per year with all in all 4,800 ml albumin, the total annual cost saving
would be £24,000 switching from open to closed albumin infusions.
Conclusion Switching from an open to a closed albumin infusion
system may result in a reduction in the risk of external contamination,
resulting in less infection and may provide a cost saving for the
healthcare system.

Introduction Despite the fact that colloids are widely used, doubt still
remains as to which colloid is the best and what is the ideal volume of
administration. The aim of our study was to compare the hemodynamic
effects of six different colloids.

Methods A total of 180 patients were enrolled in our study undergoing
general surgery procedures, who were assigned to six groups (A, B, C, D,
E, F). After fasting fluid replacement and induction of anesthesia, 500 ml
Gelofusine, Haemaccel, Voluven, HES 6%, HES 10% and Hemohes were
administered to each group respectively. An oesophageal Doppler
monitor probe was inserted into the patients for measuring stroke
volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO). Standard monitoring included
ECG, IBP, ETCO, and SpO,, and heart rate (HR). Systemic arterial pressure

(SAP), SV and CO were recorded directly before the administration of
any colloid (TO) and every 5 minutes for the next 1 hour (T1 to T12).
Kolmogorov-Smirnov was used to test normal distribution of data and
ANOVA was used for the statistical analysis. P <0.05 was considered
Statistically significant.

Results Demographic data and ASA classification did not differ
Statistically significant among the six groups of the study. CO, SV, HR
and SAP did not show any statistically significant evolution compared
with their baseline value during the study period. Moreover, there were
no statistically significant differences among the six study groups with
regard to any of the recorded parameters.

Conclusion According to our results, volume replacement with the
six colloids tested in our study did not result in any hemodynamic
response. Within comparison of these six colloids did not reveal any
Statistically significant difference in any of the parameters recorded
according to our protocol.

Introduction The biochemical characteristics of infused fluids may be
important in regulating acid-base balance, by modifying plasmatic
volume and strong ion difference. /n vitro and animal studies [1,2] have
shown that volume and strong ion difference of infused fluids (SIDin)
as well as the arterial baseline bicarbonate concentration (HCO,-a)
influence acid-base variations. Our aim was to verify these changes in
critically ill patients after surgery.
Methods An electronic-dedicated database was created to retro-
spectively collect volume, type of fluids infused and plasmatic acid-
base balance variations in postoperative ICU patients from admission
to 9:00 am of the day after. SIDin was calculated as the average SID of all
fluids infused during the whole study period (crystalloids, colloids and
blood products). Arterial base excess variation (ABEa) was computed
as the difference between values at 9:00 am on the day after and those
at entry. We report data from all patients admitted in 2006 and 2007
(650 patients).
Results Nine patients not receiving intravenous infusions were
excluded. The remaining population was divided into three groups
according to SIDin distribution (Group 1, 18 + 12; Group 2, 47 + 6;
Group 3, 55 + 0 mEq/l). We observed a progressive increment in
ABEa between the groups (1.1 + 2.0 vs. 2.8 + 2.9 vs. 3.0 + 2.8 mmol/l,
P <0.001). We further subdivided each group by the median value of
baseline HCO,-a (24.3 (22.3 to 26.1) mmol/l) and we analyzed the ABEa:
we observed a greater increase in patients with lower baseline HCO,-a
(Group 1, 1.8 + 2.9 vs. 0.2 + 2.6, mmol/l, P <0.001; Group 2, 4.0 + 2.7
vs. 1.5 + 2.6, mmol/l, P <0.001; Group 3, 4.4 + 2.8 vs. 1.7 + 2.0 mmol/l,
P <0.001), as compared with those with higher baseline levels. When
the study population was divided into quartiles of the difference
between SIDin and HCO,-a, ABEa appeared to increase with the rise of
such difference (P <0.001).
Conclusion S!IDin affects the acid-base status per se and in relation-
ship with HCO,-a. We verified this hypothesis in critically ill patients,
highlighting the importance of the difference between SIDin
and HCO,-a, which better describes and predicts the acid-base
modifications to fluid therapy.

Introduction Fluid resuscitation should improve tissue oxygenation in
hypovolemia, besides restoring macrohemodynamic stability [1]. We
evaluated the microvascular response to fluid challenge with different
colloid solutions and its relation to macrohemodynamics.

Methods An observational study of patients receiving a fluid challenge
(500 ml colloids in 30 minutes) according to the attending physician's
decision. Before and after the infusion, sublingual microcirculation was
evaluated with sidestream dark-field imaging (Microscan; Microvision
Medical, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Microvascular flow and density
were assessed for small vessels [2]. The cardiac index (Cl), intrathoracic
blood volume index (ITBVI) and extravascular lung water index (ELWI)
were measured in seven patients with PiCCO2 (Pulsion Medical System,
Munich, Germany).

Results Ten patients (two sepsis, four trauma, three intracranial
bleeding, one post surgery) received either saline-based hydroxyethyl
starch (HES) 130/0.4 (Amidolite®; B.,BraunSpA; n = 5) or balanced HES
130/0.42 (Tetraspan®; B.BraunSpA; n = 5). The Cl (P = 0.02) and ITBVI
(P = 0.07) tended to increase, the EVLWI did not change. Microvascular
flow and density improved in the whole sample. No correlation was
found between macro-circulatory and micro-circulatory parameters.
Balanced HES led to a greater increase in capillary density than NaCl
HES (Figure 1).

Conclusion Balanced HES may be more efficacious than saline-based
HES in recruiting the microcirculation, thereby improving tissue O,
delivery.

Introduction Are safety guidelines being followed when administering
procedural sedation in the emergency department? Between
November 2004 and November 2008, the NPSA received 498 alerts
of patients being given the wrong dose of midazolam for procedural
sedation [1]. In the first 5 years of midazolam use there were 86 deaths,
most related to procedural sedation [2].
Methods We searched through the controlled drugs book in
resuscitation over a 2-month period and found a list of patients who
had received midazolam or fentanyl. From this, we could make a search
for the relevant A and E notes for these patients. From these notes, we
looked for (see shorthand in Table 1): verbal consent documentation
(consent), past medical history recorded (pmhx), safe initial dose of
midazolam (midaz), pre-procedure monitoring (pre), post-procedure
monitoring (post), and monitoring for 1 hour before discharge (Thr).
Following introduction of a reminder in the controlled drugs book/
sedation room and staff education, the case notes were analysed over
another 2-month period (24 sets of notes) to assess practise against
safety guidelines.
Results See Table 1 (key for shorthand in Methods).
Conclusion The re-audit notices within the procedural sedation room
and controlled drug book front cover served as a reminder of good
practise. The visibility of this reminder (within the CD book) helped
ensure better adherence to the audit standard. This reminder will now
be kept within the CD book.

King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P381 (doi: 10.1186/cc12319)

Introduction Daily sedation interruption and protocol implementation
have been recommended to reduce excessive sedation; however,
their use has been inconsistent. We hypothesized that the use of an
age, kidney and liver function adjusted sedation protocol would be

associated with reduced doses and improved outcomes compared
with a standard protocol.

Methods This was a prospective cohort study comparing 3 months
of a standard protocol (control group) with 3 months of an adjusted
protocol (intervention group). In the adjusted protocol, patients
were divided into three categories: category 1 (age <60 years, and
normal kidney and liver function), category 2 (age = 60 to 70 years,
or moderate kidney or liver function impairment), and category 3
(age >70 years, or severe kidney or liver function impairment). The
upper limits of analgesics and sedatives doses were determined
by age, and kidney and liver function, being lowest in category
3, and lower in category 2 than category 1. All consecutive adults
mechanically ventilated patients who required infusion of analgesics
and/or sedatives for >24 hours were included in the study. We
compared the main outcomes of both groups including average daily
doses of analgesics and sedatives; average Sedation—Agitation Scale
(SAS), pain and GCS scores; mechanical ventilation duration (MVD);
sedation-related complications during ICU stay; ICU and hospital
length of stay (LOS), and ICU and hospital mortality.

Results Two hundred and four patients were included in the study
(control group = 105; adjusted protocol group = 99). There was no
difference in baseline characteristics between the two groups. The
adjusted protocol group, compared with the control group, received
significantly lower average daily doses of fentanyl (2,162 + 2,110 ug
vs. 3,650 + 3,253 ug, P = 0.0001), nonsignificant lower average daily
doses of midazolam and dexmedetomidine, and a trend toward
higher average daily doses of propofol. Pain score was higher in the
adjusted protocol group (0.98 + 0.72 vs. 0.16 + 0.35, P <0.0001) with
no difference in SAS or GCS scores. Sedation-related complications
during ICU stay were not different between the two groups; however,
agitation (SAS = 5) was less frequent in the adjusted protocol group
(3% vs. 30%, P <0.0001). ICU mortality was significantly lower in the

http://ccforum.com/supplements/17/S2

adjusted protocol group (18% vs. 36%, P = 0.004) with no significant
differences in MVD, ICU and hospital LOS, and hospital mortality.
Conclusion The use of an age, kidney and liver function adjusted
sedation protocol is associated with lower doses of analgesics and
sedatives, lower risk of agitation and lower ICU mortality.

Hospital, Okayama, Japan; *Tokushima University Hospital, Tokushima, Japan
Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P382 (doi: 10.1186/cc12320)

Introduction Protocol-directed sedation (PS) and daily interruption of
sedation (DIS) are two major strategies to optimize sedation depth for
mechanically ventilated patients. To clarify the clinical risk and benefits
of PS and DIS, we performed a systematic review of randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) in previous literature.

Methods We searched the MEDLINE database from January 1990
to October 2012 for studies on PS and DIS in critically ill patients.
English-language manuscripts were included when they assessed
the impact of PS or DIS on outcomes in critically ill patients requiring
mechanical ventilation for >48 hours. PS is defined as sedation
practices implemented by ICU staff using a sedation scale and a
written protocol. DIS is defined as strategies with cessation of the
continuous sedatives.

Results We retrieved 902 citations. Among them, nine RCTs fulfilled
inclusion criteria. PS was compared with the standard practice in one
RCT, DIS with the standard practice in four, PS with DIS in two, and PS
with PS plus DIS (PS/DIS) in two. PS or DIS reduced the duration of
mechanical ventilation by 28.9% and ICU stay by 27.8% compared with
the standard practice. Neither the duration of mechanical ventilation
nor ICU stay differed among DIS, PS and PS/DIS. Mortality did not differ
among the three strategies. DIS increased the daily dose of sedatives
and the workload of nurses in one recent RCT.

Conclusion PS or DIS decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation
and ICU stay. PS seems to be superior to DIS based on the doses of
sedatives and the workload of nurses.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P383 (doi: 10.1186/cc12321)

Introduction The aim of this research was to provide clinically relevant
evidence for Y-site compatibility of drug infusion combinations used in
the PICU. Pharmacists and clinicians regularly have to interpret limited
published data, particularly when more than two drugs are Y-sited.
The risk of potential incompatibility must be balanced against that of
additional line insertion.

Methods A full 28-factorial design (total 256 combinations) was
used to investigate chemical and physical compatibility of five drugs
(clonidine, morphine, ketamine, midazolam and furosemide). The
drugs were studied at their highest commonly infused concentrations
and exposed to three variations in environmental conditions (diluent:
sodium chloride 0.9% or glucose 10%; temperature 25 or 37°C;
and normal room lighting or blue light phototherapy). Chemical
stability was assessed using HPLC; >10% reduction in concentration
indicated incompatibility. Physical incompatibility was confirmed by
precipitation, pH or colour change.

Results Environmental conditions had no effect on the drug mixtures.
The precipitation observed in incompatible combinations was due to
either a change in pH, or with ketamine the presence of benzethonium
chloride. Of 31 possible drug combinations, 12 were incompatible. A
further three combinations were incompatible at extreme pH, or were
of concern and so should be avoided. The incompatible formulations

$144

all contained furosemide. All combinations of the sedative agents

studied were chemically and physically compatible.

Conclusion This work provides evidence for Y-site compatibility of

morphine, midazolam, clonidine and ketamine in any combination,

which will potentially reduce the need for extra intravenous lines.

Furosemide is incompatible with any of these sedative drugs and must

be infused via a separate line. These results will aid clinical decision-

making and help satisfy the requirements of recent UK Department of

Health legislation relating to the mixing of medicines.

Introduction In light of the interest in the relationship between
glycemia control in critically ill subjects and outcome, we set up a study
to investigate whether benzodiazepine, commonly used in anesthesia
and ICUs, interferes with glucose metabolism and to explore the
mechanism.

Methods A total of 40 sedated and paralyzed Sprague-Dawley rats
(301 + 55 g) were investigated in four consecutive studies. (1) To
investigate the effects of diazepam on blood glucose, 15 rats were
randomly assigned to intraperitoneal anesthesia with tiopenthal
80 mg/kg (DZPO), tiopenthal 40 mg/kg + diazepam 5 mg/kg (DPZ5)
or tiopenthal 40 mg/kg + diazepam 15 mg/kg (DZP15). Blood levels of
glucose (GEM premier 3000; IL) were measured at time intervals over
2 hours. (2) Ten animals randomized to DZPO or DZP5 underwent an
intravenous glucose tolerance test with glucose bolus (0.5 g/kg). Acute
insulin response, the mean value of blood insulin (Insulin ELISA kit;
Millipore) from 2 to 10 minutes after glucose bolus, was measured as
index of insulin secretion. (3) A hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp
obtained by a continuous intravenous infusion of insulin (130 mUI/
kg/minute) was run in 10 animals randomized to DZPO or DZP5 and
the glucose infusion rate (GIR, mg/kg/minute) was assessed [1]. (4) The
effect of midazolam on blood glucose was tested in five additional
animals (M5: tiophental 40 mg/kg + midazolam 5 mg/kg). Data are
presented as mean + SEM. Statistical analysis (ANOVA, t test) was
conducted with Sigma Stat 3.1 (Systat Software).

Results (1) Diazepam was associated with higher levels of blood
glucose in a dose-response fashion: DZPO 128 + 7 mg/dl, DZP5
166 + 7.3, DZP15 197 + 7 (P <0.05). (2) The acute insulin response
to intravenous glucose tolerance test was similar in DZPO and DZP5
(DZPO 3.97 + 0.42 ng/ml, DZP5 3.68 + 0.44, P = 0.68), while blood
glucose levels were different (DZPO 192 + 5 mg/dl, DZP5 217 + 5,
P <0.05). (3) During hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, blood
glucose levels were similar (109 + 3 mg/dl, P = 0.2), but the DZP5
group showed a trend through lower values of GIR (DZPO 30.8 + 2 mg/
kg/minute, DZP5 24.7 + 2, P = 0.08). (4) Infusion of midazolam was
associated with higher blood glucose levels (DZPO 128 + 5 mg/dl, M5
151 +6, P<0.05).

Conclusion Both diazepam and midazolam significantly alter plasma
glucose levels in rats. Peripheral disposal of glucose rather than altered
pancreas secretion of insulin explains the benzodiazepine-associated
hyperglycemia.

Introduction We report our experience in the use of isoflurane for
prolonged sedation in severe ARDS patients. Prolonged sedation in
the ICU may be difficult because of tolerance, drug dependence and
withdrawal, drug interactions and side effects. Inhaled anesthetics
have been proposed for sedation in ventilator-dependent ICU patients.
AnaConDa is a device that allows a safety and easy administration of
inhaled anesthetics in the ICU.

Methods From January 2009 to June 2012, 15 patients were sedated
with isoflurane by means of the AnaConDa device. We consider
administration of isoflurane as a washout period from common
sedative drugs in patients with (at least one of): high sedative drug
dosage (propofol =>300 mg/hour or midazolam =8 mg/hour) to reach
the target Richmond Agitation Sedation Score (RASS) or inadequate
paralysis; two or more hypnotic drugs to reach the target RASS
(propofol, midazolam, hydroxyzine, haloperidol, diazepam, quetiapine);
and hypertriglyceridemia. During isoflurane administration previous
hypnotic drugs were interrupted. We retrospectively collected data
before, during and after administration of isoflurane: hemodynamic
parameters, renal and hepatic function, level of sedation (RASS)
and sedative drug dosage. All data are reported as mean + standard
deviation, otherwise as median (minimum to maximum).

Results Mean age was 43 + 12 years and SAPS II was 35.7 + 11; 13
patients were treated with ECMO for severe ARDS and four had a
history of drug abuse; median ICU length of stay was 41 (15 to 127)
days and they were ventilated for 41 (12 to 114) days. Due to severe
critical illness, target RASS was —4 for all patients, most of which were
also paralysed. Isoflurane was administered in nine patients because
of a high level of common sedative drugs, in five patients due to the
use of two or more hypnotic drugs and in one patient because of
hypertrigliceridemia. Isoflurane administration lasted 5.6 + 1.8 days.
During isoflurane administration no alteration in renal function or
hemodynamic instability was recorded. After the isoflurane washout
period we observed a reduction in sedative drug dosage in 10 patients
while two patients were quickly weaned from mechanical ventilation
and the target RASS raised to 0. In two patients isoflurane was
precautionarily interrupted because of concomitant alteration of liver
function and suspected seizures respectively.

Conclusion Inhaled anesthetics could be successfully used in the ICU
especially in case of an inadequate sedation plan; for example, in
patients with a history of drug abuse or young severe ARDS patients
that required deep sedation and paralysis for a long period.

Involvement of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K* channels in fentanyl-
induced mitochondrial dysfunction of cultured human hepatocytes

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P387 (doi: 10.1186/cc12325)

Introduction Pharmacological agents used to treat critically ill patients
may alter mitochondrial function. The aim of the present study was
to investigate whether fentanyl, a commonly used analgesic drug,
interacts with hepatic mitochondrial function.

Methods The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was exposed to
fentanyl at 0.5, 2 or 10 ng/ml for 1 hour, or pretreated with naloxone
(an opioid receptor antagonist) at 200 ng/ml or 5-hydroxydecanoate
(5-HD; a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K* (KATP)
channels) at 50 uM for 30 minutes, followed by incubation with
fentanyl at 2 ng/ml for an additional hour. The mitochondrial complex
l-dependent, Il-dependent and IV-dependent oxygen consumption
rates of the permeabilized cells were measured using a high-resolution
oxygraph (Oxygraph-2k; Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria).
The respiratory electron transfer capacity of intact cells was evaluated
using FCCP (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) to
obtain the maximum flux.

Results Incubation of HepG2 cells with fentanyl (1 hour, 2 ng/ml)
induced a reduction in complex Il-dependent and IV-dependent
respiration (Figure 1). Cells pretreated with 5-HD before the addition
of fentanyl exhibited no significant changes in complex activities in
comparison with controls. Pretreatment with naloxone tended to
abolish the fentanyl-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment
with fentanyl led to a reduction in cellular ATP content (0.24 + 0.06 in
controls vs. 0.17 + 0.14 umol/mg cellular protein in stimulated cells;
P=0.02).We did not observe any difference in basal or FCCP-uncoupled
respiration rates of cells treated with fentanyl at 2 ng/ml compared
with controls (data not shown).

Conclusion Fentanyl reduces cultured human hepatocyte mito-
chondrial respiration by a mechanism that is blocked by a KATP channel
antagonist. In contrast, antagonism with naloxone does not seem to
completely abolish the effect of fentanyl.

and microvessel permeability. The cholinergic anti-inflammatory
pathway (CAP) is a neurophysiological mechanism that regulates
the inflammatory response by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine

microcirculatory dysfunction can be reduced by cholinergic CAP
activation. Clonidine improves survival in experimental sepsis [1] by
reducing the sympathetic tone, resulting in the parasympathetic-
mediated CAP activation. The aim of this study was to determine the
effects of clonidine on microcirculatory alterations during endotoxemia.
Methods Using fluorescent intravital microscopy, we determined
the venular wall shear rate, macromolecular efflux and leukocyte
adhesion in mesenteric postcapillary venules of male Wistar rats.
Endotoxemia was induced over 120 minutes by intravenous infusion
of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Control groups received an equivalent
volume of saline. Clonidine 10 ug/kg was applied as i.v. bolus in
treatment groups. Animals received either (i) saline alone, (ii) clonidine
10 minutes prior to saline administration, (iii) clonidine 45 minutes
prior to LPS administration, (iv) clonidine 10 minutes prior to LPS
administration, (v) clonidine 30 minutes after LPS administration or
(vi) LPS alone.

Results All LPS groups (iii to vi) showed a significantly reduced venular
wall shear rate compared with the saline group after 120 minutes. There
were no significant differences between the numbers of adhering
leukocytes in the clonidine/LPS groups (iii, iv, v) and the LPS group
after 120 minutes. Macromolecular efflux significantly increased in all
groups over the time period of 120 minutes. After 120 minutes there
was no difference between the LPS group and the clonidine 10 minutes
prior to LPS administration group (iv) whereas all other groups (i, ii, iii, v)
showed a significantly reduced macromolecular efflux compared with
the LPS group.

Conclusion Clonidine has no positive effect on microhemodynamic
alterations and leukocyte—endothelial interaction during endotoxemia.
The reduction of capillary leakage in clonidine-treated groups
depends on the time interval relative to the initiation of endotoxemia.
Endothelial permeability and leukocyte activation are regulated by
different pathways when stimulated by clonidine during endotoxemia.
We conclude that clonidine might have an important time-dependent
anti-inflammatory and protective effect on endothelial activation
during inflammation.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P389 (doi: 10.1186/cc12327)

Introduction Delivering analgesics via conjunctival application could
provide rapid and convenient pain relief in disaster medicine. There are
sporadic reports from the USA concerning inhalation administration
of aerosol with various drugs producing a wide variety of effects from
anxiolysis, sedation, and loss of aggressiveness to immobilisation. We
attempted to determine in an animal experiment whether conjunctival
administration of S+ketamine could produce significant effect without
side effects.

Methods After ethic committee approval, 10 rabbits were administered
conjunctival S+ketamine 2.5 mg/kg. Measured parameters were SpO,,
blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) before administration and in
1-minute intervals and immobilisation time (loss of righting reflex). The
measurements were performed for 20 minutes. Conjunctival irritation
was measured 1, 10 and 20 minutes after administration according to
modified technical standard EN IS O 10993-10. ANOVA test was used for
statistical analysis of hemodynamic parameters.

Results The immobilisation time was 207 + 60 seconds. There were
no changes in cardiorespiratory parameters (initial, 10 and 20 minutes
after administration: HR 255.5 + 24.7, 265.8 + 26.0 and 267.8 + 20.4,
systolic BP 114.3 + 8.6, 108.2 + 10.7 and 113.9 + 11.9 mmHg, diastolic
BP 66.8 + 11.6, 68.4 + 10.6 and 69.7 + 9.3 mmHg and SpO, 99.2 + 1.0,
98.2 + 0.6 and 98.7 + 0.5). These results are in contrast to conjunctival
administration of sufentanil 5 ug/kg that caused a significant decrease
of SpO, and HR [1]. We can speculate that the reason for stability of
cardiorespiratory parameters was due to the sympathoadrenergic

$146

effect of ketamine or due to the method of administration. There

were no signs of conjunctival irritation in any animal (S+ketamine is a

preservative-free solution).

Conclusion Conjunctival S+ketamine 2.5 mg/kg in rabbits produced

rapid onset without changes in cardiorespiratory parameters and

without signs of irritation of the eye. The results of our project warrant

further research to increase the variety of drugs and methods of

their administration for anxiolysis, sedation and analgesia in disaster

medicine.

Use of propofol for procedural sedation reduces length of stay in
the emergency department

Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P390 (doi: 10.1186/cc12328)

Introduction Procedural sedation is used in the emergency department
(ED) to facilitate short but painful interventions. Many patients are
suitable for discharge after completion. Ideally, the agent used to
achieve sedation should not have a prolonged effect, allowing safe
discharge in the shortest time frame. We hypothesised that propofol,
with its short onset and offset, may reduce length of stay (LOS) in
comparison with traditional benzodiazepines.

Methods Data from a prospective registry were analysed for the
period 1 August 2011 to 31 January 2012. Patients who underwent
procedural sedation and who were discharged from the ED were
identified. Individuals were grouped as having received propofol,
midazolam or a combination of the two. All were discharged when
fully alert and able to eat and drink. Demographic details and the type
of procedure undertaken were extracted. ANOVA was performed to
identify differences in the length of stay between groups, in addition
to descriptive analysis.

Results During the study period 75 patients underwent procedural
sedation and were discharged from the ED. The median age was 40
years and 57% were male. The commonest procedure performed was
shoulder reduction (52%). In the propofol group (n = 20) the mean
LOS was 100 minutes compared with 165 minutes in those receiving
midazolam (n = 40) and 141 minutes in those receiving a combination
(n = 15), P= 0.004. There was no difference in adverse events between
groups. See Figure 1.

Conclusion Propofol is increasingly used in EDs for procedural sedation
due to its short duration of action. This study suggests that a shorter
duration of action and faster recovery may result in a reduced LOS in
the ED.

Pre-PRIS? Prospective monitoring for early markers of propofol
infusion syndrome

M Stovell, S Smith, M Udberg, W Loh, P Nair

Walton Centre Neurology & Neurosurgery, Liverpool, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P391 (doi: 10.1186/cc12329)

Introduction The use of propofol for sedation in intensive care has been
associated with the propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) characterised by
cardiac dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, rhabdomyolysis
and hyperlipidaemia. We prospectively monitor biochemical markers
that we believe demonstrate early signs of this dangerous, often fatal
syndrome. When this Pre-PRIS state is identified, propofol is withdrawn
whilst the syndrome is still reversible.

Methods We prospectively audited our monitoring of these markers
over a 4-month period in propofol-sedated patients: propofol infusion
rate, creatine kinase (CK), triglycerides (TG), creatinine, lactate, pH
and base deficit. We defined the criteria for Pre-PRIS as requiring a
CK =320 mmol/I that had doubled from its base level and a rise in TG
>1.7 IU/|; both that followed a trend with propofol dose.

Results Data were collected from 54 adults; 50 received an infusion for
>24 hours. We noted a significant CK rise in 11 (22%) of our patients
that could be attributed to propofol alone. They all had raised TG
(=1.7 IU/I); six (12%) were markedly raised (=3.4 IU/I). No patients
became significantly acidotic, developed cardiac arrhythmias or renal
failure as a result of propofol. In the 11 patients who met our criteria,
highest daily propofol dose varied from 1.5 to 4 mg/kg/hour. Pre-PRIS
developed from between 2 and 6 days of infusion. The mean propofol
dose in patients displaying Pre-PRIS was 2.2 mg/kg/hour whilst in those
not meeting our criteria it was 2.0 mg/kg/hour. No patients developed
sequelae of full PRIS. See Table 1.

Table 1 (abstract P391)

Total Trauma Nontrauma
>24 hours infusion 50 34 16
TCK+ TG 23.4 6 6 0
TCK+ TG 217 5 3 2

Conclusion We propose that a paired rise in CK and TG that can be
attributed to propofol alone represents a Pre-PRIS state that is at risk
of developing into full PRIS. We noted this in 22% of our patients, all
on modest doses of propofol. It is unclear what proportion of patients
will develop the full syndrome as it is not ethically possible to continue
propofol in this situation. We advocate daily monitoring of CK and TG
to identify Pre-PRIS so that propofol can be reduced or substituted to
avoid the morbidity and mortality of the full syndrome.

Safety profile of 1,008 cases of propofol sedation in the emergency
department

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P392 (doi: 10.1186/cc12330)

Introduction Until recently there were no guidelines for the reporting
of adverse events (AEs) during procedural sedation [1,2]. A consensus
document released in 2012 by the world SIVA International Sedation
Task Force proposed a benchmark for defining AEs [3]. We analysed
1,008 cases of procedural sedation in the emergency department.
Methods The study is based on 1,008 patients who received procedural
sedation with propofol in the emergency department between
December 2006 and March 2012. Patients were selected and sedated
to a strict protocol by ED consultant staff. We applied the AE tool
by performing a search through patient records, discussion with
consultants performing the sedation and consensus opinion.

Results From 1,008 cases we identified 11 sentinel (six of hypotension,
five cases of hypoxia), 34 moderate, 25 minor and three minimal risk
adverse events.

$147

Conclusion The study shows a 1% adverse event rate. This supports use

of propofol sedation by emergency physicians but within the limits of a

strict governance framework. Our safety analysis using the World SIVA

adverse events tool provides a reference point for further studies.

Introduction Physical restraints are used to facilitate essential care
and prevent secondary injuries. However, physical restraint may be
regarded as humiliating. It may lead to local injury and increase the risk
of delirium and post-traumatic stress syndrome. Research on physical
restraint is scarce. The aim of this study is to investigate the scope of
physical restraint use.

Methods Twenty-one ICUs ranging from local hospitals to academic
centres were each visited twice and 327 patients were included. We
recorded characteristics of restrained patients, motives and awareness
of nurses and physicians.

Results Physical restraint was applied in 74 (23%) patients, ranging
from 0 to 54% in different hospitals. Frequent motives for restraint
use were ‘possible threat to airway’ (36%) and ‘pulling lines/probes’
(31%). Restrained subjects more often had a positive CAM-ICU (34%
vs. 16%, P <0.001), could less frequently verbally communicate (14%
vs. 49%, P <0.001), and received more often antipsychotics (49% vs.
28%, P <0.001), or benzodiazepines (55% vs. 36%, P = 0.003). The use
of physical restraint was registered in the patient's files in 48% of cases.
Of the 310 interviewed nurses, 258 (83%) were familiar with a physical
restraint protocol and 89 (29%) used it in any situation. Thirty percent
of the 60 interviewed physicians were aware of the physical restraint
status of their patients.

Conclusion Physical restraint is frequently used in Dutch ICUs, but the
frequency differs strongly between different ICUs. Attending physicians
are often not aware of physical restraint use.

Introduction Physical restraint (PR) use in critically ill patients has
been associated with delirium, unplanned extubation, prolonged ICU
length of stay, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Our objectives were
to define prevalence of PR use, and to examine patient, treatment, or
institutional factors associated with their use in Canadian ICUs.

Methods We conducted an analysis of a database of sedative, analgesic,
antipsychotic and neuromuscular blocker prescribing practices and PR
use in 711 mechanically ventilated (MV) adults in 51 Canadian ICUs
(3,619 patient-days). Data were collected during a 2-week period (2008
to 2009). Logistic and Poisson regression analysis were used to identify
factors associated with PR use and number of days of use respectively.
Results PR was used on 1 or more days in 52.6% (374/711) of patients.
For patients restrained, the mean number of days restrained was

4.1+4.0 and the mean number of restraint applications per patient was
1.2 + 0.5. Treatment characteristics associated with PR use were: daily
benzodiazepine dose (OR = 1.01, 95% Cl: 1.00 to 1.01), daily opiate dose
(OR = 1.00, 95% Cl: 1.00 to 1.01), daily sedation interruption (OR = 1.84,
95% Cl: 1.24 to 2.72), use of antipsychotics (OR = 3.42, 95% Cl: 1.98 to
5.91) and agitation (Sedation—Agitation Scale (SAS) >4, OR = 2.55, 95%
Cl: 1.20 to 5.44). Additionally, number of days of PR use was increased
according to the following: daily sedation interruption (IRR = 4.52,
95% Cl: 2.09 to 9.75), use of antipsychotics (IRR = 18.65, 95% Cl: 7.95
to 43.77), the presence of a heavily sedated score (SAS <3, IRR = 2.57,
95% Cl: 1.06 to 6.24) or the presence of an adverse event, such as self-
extubation (IRR = 10.46, 95% Cl: 2.55 to 42.92). Hospital characteristics
associated with PR use included the proportion of MV patients in
the ICU. University hospitals were associated with reduced PR use,
compared with community hospitals (OR = 0.272, 95% Cl: 0.15 to 0.50).
Nonmodifiable patient characteristics (age, sex, APACHE score, patient
category, prior substance abuse, prior psychotropic medication, pre-
existing psychiatric condition or dementia) were not associated with
PR use.

Conclusion We identified multiple factors associated with PR use
and number of days of PR use. Particularly among those related to
treatment, strategies such as daily sedation interruption or use of
antipsychotics are associated with PR use and increasing the number
of days of use.

Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands

Introduction As part of a multicenter prospective study on barriers
and facilitators for implementation of protocolled care for delirious
critically ill patients, we aimed to describe current practices in delirium
management in a representative cohort of ICU patients.

Methods We included consecutively admitted patients during a
4-month period in a prospective multicenter study in six ICUs (one
academic, teaching and nonteaching hospitals) in the southwest of
the Netherlands. We assessed: percentage of patients screened for
delirium with validated screening tools; pharmacological treatment
with haloperidol or other antipsychotic drugs; psychohygiene (use of
hearing aids and or glasses, preventing sleep disturbances); and access
to early mobilization and physiotherapy. Delirium was pragmatically
defined as administration of haloperidol and/or delirium reported by
physicians or ICU nurses in patient records, as assessed by a designated
research nurse. Differences between centers were tested with non-
parametric tests.

Results We assessed 1,576 patients, corresponding with 8,150 ICU
treatment days with a median length of stay of 3 days (IQR 2 to 5).
The mean age of the patients was 62 years (SD = 16) and 58% were
male. Delirium occurred in 23% (356/1,576) of patients with a median
duration of 3 days (IQR 2 to 7) and ranged from 11 to 40% for each ICU.
Delirium assessment with the CAM-ICU at any point during ICU stay
was performed in 38% of all patients. Screening with CAM-ICU was
applied in three ICUs, in 29 to 96% of the patients in these centers. Of
3,564 documented screening days with the CAM-ICU, it was positive
in 1,459 (41%); in only 120 (8%) of these CAM-ICU-positive days there
was a documented action or treatment started for delirium. However,
patients still received haloperidol on 52% (n = 766) of all CAM-ICU-
positive days. Patients received benzodiazepines in 49% (n = 1,141)
of patient sedation days. Delirium preventive interventions were
physiotherapy (19% of 8,150 ICU days), mobilization (10%), glasses
use (2.6%) and hearing aid use (0.3%). Presence of hearing or visual
impairment at admission was not documented in 65% of patients.
Conclusion Daily screening for ICU delirium with a validated screening
instrument is applied in less than one-half of the time in critically ill
patients and management of delirium is often not guided by this
screening. Haloperidol was used as the first-choice medication.
Measures aimed at delirium prevention (psychohygiene and early

$148

mobilization) were carried only in a small minority or were not
documented. To implement protocolled delirium care in the region at
study, a multifaceted tailored implementation program is needed.

Introduction The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of
intraoperative administration of dexamethasone versus placebo on the
incidence of delirium in the first four postoperative days after cardiac
surgery.

Methods Within the context of the large multicenter Dexamethasone
for Cardiac Surgery (DECS) trial [1] for which patients were randomized
to 1 mg/kg dexamethasone or placebo at induction of anesthesia, a
monocenter substudy was conducted. The primary outcome of this
study was the incidence of delirium in the first four postoperative
days. Secondary outcomes were duration of delirium, use of restrictive
measures and sedative, antipsychotic and analgesic requirements.
Delirium was assessed daily by trained research personnel, using the
Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment
Method. Medical, nursing and medication charts were evaluated for
signs of delirium and use of prespecified medication. Analysis was by
intention to treat.

Results Of 768 eligible patients, complete data on delirium could
be collected in 738 patients. The incidence of delirium was 14.2% in
the dexamethasone group and 14.9% in the placebo group (odds
ratio = 0.95, 95% Cl = 0.63 to 1.43). No significant difference was found
on the duration of delirium between the intervention (median = 2 days,
interquartile range 1 to 3 days) and placebo (median = 2 days,
interquartile range 1 to 2 days) group (P = 0.45). The use of restrictive
measures and administration of sedatives, haloperidol, benzodiazepine
and opiates were comparable between both groups.

Conclusion Intraoperative injection of dexamethasone seems not
to affect the incidence or duration of delirium in the first 4 days after
cardiac surgery, suggesting this regimen is safe to use in the operative
setting with respect to psychiatric adverse events.

Introduction The beliefs, knowledge and practices regarding ICU
delirium among ICU professionals may vary. This may interfere with
the implementation of the Dutch ICU Delirium guideline. We aimed to
get insight into potential barriers and facilitators for delirium guideline
implementation that may help to find an effective implementation
strategy.

Methods An online survey was sent to healthcare professionals from
the six participating ICUs. Respondents included ICU physicians, nurses
and delirium experts (psychiatrists, neurologists, geriatricians, nurse
experts). The survey consisted of statements on beliefs, knowledge
and practices towards ICU delirium. Agreement with statements by
more than 75% of respondents were regarded as facilitating items and
agreement lower than 50% as barriers for implementing protocolled
care.

Results Of the 565 surveys distributed, 360 were completed (63.7%).
The majority of respondents were ICU nurses (79%). Delirium was
considered a major problem (83%) that requires adequate treatment
(99%) and is underdiagnosed (81%). Respondents considered that

routine screening of delirium can improve prognosis (95%). However,
only a minority (20%) answered that delirium is preventable. Only
39% of the respondents had received any training about delirium
in the previous 3 years and 77% of them found training useful. The
mean delirium knowledge score was 6.6 out of 10 (SD = 1.54). When
all groups were mutually compared, nurses scored lower than delirium
experts (ANOVA, P = 0.013). The respondents (58%; n = 210) from three
ICUs indicated that CAM-ICU assessment was department policy.
However, 50% (n = 106) of these respondents felt unfamiliar with CAM-
ICU and only 47% (n = 99) of them indicated that a positive CAM-ICU
was used for treatment decisions. Haloperidol was the first-choice
pharmacological treatment. Only 21% of all respondents knew that a
national ICU delirium guideline existed, but in-depth knowledge was
generally low.

Conclusion Our survey showed that healthcare professionals
considered delirium an important but underdiagnosed form of
organ failure. In contrast, screening tools for delirium are scarcely
used, knowledge can be improved and protocolled treatment based
on positive screening is often lacking. These results suggest that the
focus of implementation of ICU delirium management should not be
on motivational aspects, but on knowledge improvements, training
in screening tools and implementation of treatment and prevention
protocols.

Introduction Delirium is a serious and frequent disorder in ICU patients.
The aim of this study was to internationally validate the existing
Prediction of Delirium ICU (PREDELIRIC) model to predict delirium in
ICU patients.

Methods A prospective multicenter cohort study was performed in
eight ICUs in six countries (Table 1). The 10 predictors (age, APACHE
Il score, urgent and admission category, infection, coma, sedation,
morphine use, urea level, metabolic acidosis) were collected within
24 hours after ICU admission. CAM-ICU was used to identify ICU
delirium.

Results A total of 2,852 adult ICU patients were screened and 1,824
(64%) were included. Main exclusion reasons were length of stay <1 day
(19.1%) and sustained coma (4.1%). Mean + CAM-ICU compliance

Delirium in ICU patients is associated with increased temperature
variability

Introduction Delirium is an acute disturbance of consciousness
and cognition. It is a common disorder in the ICU and associated
with impaired long-term outcome [1,2]. Despite its frequency and
impact, delirium is poorly recognized by ICU physicians and nurses
using delirium screening tools [3]. A completely new approach to
detect delirium is to use monitoring of physiological alterations.
Temperature variability, a measure for temperature regulation, could
be an interesting parameter for monitoring of ICU delirium, but this has
never been investigated before. The aim of this study was to investigate
whether temperature variability is affected during ICU delirium.
Methods We included patients in whom days with delirium could
be compared with days without delirium, based on the Confusion
Assessment Method for the ICU and inspection of medical records.
Patients with conditions affecting thermal regulation, including
infectious diseases, and those receiving therapies affecting body
temperature were excluded. Twenty-four ICU patients were included
after screening 334 delirious ICU patients. Daily temperature variability
was determined by computing the mean absolute second derivative
of the temperature signal. Per patient, temperature variability
during delirious days was compared with nondelirium days using a
Wilcoxon signed-rank test. With a linear mixed model, differences
between delirium and nondelirium days with regard to temperature
variability were analysed adjusted for daily mean Richmond Agitation
and Sedation Scale scores, daily maximum Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment score, and within-patient correlation.

Results Temperature variability was increased during delirium days
compared with days without delirium (mean difference = -0.007, 95%
Cl = -0.004; -0.011, P <0.001). Adjusting for confounders did not alter
our findings (adjusted mean difference = -0.005, 95% Cl = —0.008;
—0.002, P <0.001).

Conclusion Temperature variability is increased during delirium
in ICU patients, which reflects the encephalopathy that underlies
delirium. Opportunities for delirium monitoring using temperature
variability should be further explored. Particularly, in combination with
electroencephalography it could provide the input for an objective tool
to monitor delirium.

Introduction In ICU patients, little research has been performed on
the relationship between delirium and long-term outcome, including
health-related quality of life (HRQoL), cognitive functioning and
mortality. In addition, results seem to be inconsistent. Furthermore,
in studies that reported increased mortality in delirious patients,
no proper adjustments were made for severity of illness during ICU
admission. This study was conducted to investigate the association

----$$$$----$$$$----

http://ccforum.com/supplements/17/S2

between ICU delirium and long-term HRQoL, cognitive functioning
and mortality. The hypothesis was that delirious patients have worse
long-term outcome in comparison with nondelirious patients.
Methods A prospective observational cohort study was conducted.
A median of 12 months after ICU discharge, questionnaires were sent
to all survivors. HRQoL and cognitive functioning were measured with
the EuroQol-6D. Age, gender and severity of illness were considered
relevant covariates. Severity of illness was estimated using the APACHE
IV score and the maximal SOFA score during admission. HRQoL was
investigated with linear regression analysis, cognitive functioning
using logistic regression and mortality with Cox regression analysis.
Results The patient population consisted of 690 patients admitted to
the ICU, subdivided into delirious (n = 257) and nondelirious patients
(n = 433). During follow-up, 181 (26%) patients died. The response rate
of the questionnaire was 70.6%. After adjusting for the predefined
covariates, delirium was significantly associated with a lower HRQoL
(adjusted B: —0.137; 95% Cl = -0.140 to -0.005) and more mild and
severe cognitive impairment (adjusted odds ratio: respectively: 2.3; 95%
Cl = 1.3 to 4.2 and 5.8; 95% Cl = 1.3 to 15.2). No significant association
between delirium and long-term mortality was found (adjusted hazard
ratio: 1.0; 95% Cl = 0.7 to1.4).

Conclusion Delirium during ICU admission was associated with
lower HRQoL and worse cognitive functioning, 1 year after discharge.
Furthermore, delirium on the ICU was not associated with long-term
mortality after adjusting for relevant covariates, including severity of
illness during ICU admission.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P401 (doi: 10.1186/cc12339)

Introduction We aimed to clarify the differences between primary and
secondary acute Gl injury.

Methods A total of 2,690 consecutive adult patients were retro-
spectively studied during their first week in the ICU. Pathology in the
Gl system or laparotomy defined the primary Gl insult. If Gl symptoms
developed without primary Gl insult it was considered secondary Gl
injury. Absent bowel sounds (BS), vomiting/regurgitation, diarrhoea,
bowel distension, GI bleeding, and high gastric residuals (GRV
>1,000 ml/24 hours) were recorded daily.

Results In total, 2,690 patients (60.4% male), median age 59 years
(range 16 to 92), were studied. Eighty-four per cent of them were
ventilated, 72% received vasopressor/inotrope. Median (IQR) APACHE
Il score was 14 (9 to 21) and SOFA on the first day was 6 (3 to 10). A
total 35.5% had primary GI pathology. During the first week 34% of
patients had absent BS, 38% vomiting/regurgitation, 9% diarrhoea,
7% bowel distension, 6% high GRV and 5% Gl bleeding. All symptoms
except diarrhoea occurred more often (<0.001) in patients with primary
Gl insult. Eighty-five per cent of patients with primary GI insult versus
46% without developed at least one GI symptom. The incidence of Gl
symptoms was significantly higher in nonsurvivors. ICU mortality was
lower in patients with primary than secondary Gl injury (43.6% vs.
61.2%, P = 0.046). Nonsurvivors without primary Gl insult developed Gl
symptoms later (Figure 1).

Conclusion Primary and secondary acute GI injury have different
incidence, dynamics and outcome.

ventilation with relative risk of 9 to 27% and with mortality of 25 to
50% [1,2]. One of the promoting factors of VAP is the increased pH of
the gastric acid, which occurs when H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA)
or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are used for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
The aim of this study was to investigate effects of PPI versus H2RA
on the occurrence of VAP and, as second endpoint, the occurrence of
gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).

Methods After ethics committee approval mechanically ventilated
(>48 hours) adults were recruited in a prospective randomized
controlled, double-blind clinical trial and randomised into PPI or H2RA
groups. Patients with admission diagnosis of pneumonia or other
acute inflammatory pulmonary disease, severe sepsis/septic shock,
and/or regular PPI/H2RA users were excluded. The diagnostic criteria
for VAP were: leukocytosis, increased PCT level, fever, purulent tracheal
secretion, positive microbiological result of tracheal sample, and new/
increased infiltrate on chest X-ray. Data are presented as median
(interquartile range, IQR). For statistical analysis Mann-Whitney U test
and chi-square tests were used.

Results Out of 94 patients recruited 14 were excluded due to early
weaning/death (n = 9) or protocol violation (n = 6). The remaining
79 patients were analysed (PPI, n = 38; H2RA, n = 41). There was
no significant difference (P >0.05) between the groups regarding
demographics: age 67 (56 to 77) versus 72 (58 to 79) years; male/
female: 23/15 versus 25/16; length of mechanical ventilation: 5 (3 to
9) versus 5 (2 to 8) days; APACHE II score: 28 (22 to 32) versus 26 (21 to
36) (PPI vs. H2RA, respectively). There was no significant difference in
the number of cases with VAP in the PPI versus H2RA groups: 9 (24%)
versus 10 (24%). None of the patients developed GI bleeding during
their stay on the ICU.

Conclusion The results of this pilot study suggest that there may
be no difference in the incidence of VAP and Gl bleeding if stress
ulcer prophylaxis is performed by H2RA or PPI. As the latter is more
expensive, its use as first choice in critical care should be questioned.

Early diagnosis of liver failure in septic patients using the
maximal liver function capacity test (LIMAx test): comparison with
conventional methods

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P403 (doi: 10.1186/cc12341)

Introduction Patients with bacterial sepsis often suffer from multiorgan
failure. No reliable parameter exists for the exact estimation of the liver
function. The indocyaningreen test (ICG test) showed a correlation
between liver function and mortality rate. The new maximal liver
function capacity test (LiMAx test) is a real-time method to investigate
the liver function.
Methods Thirty septic patients were prospectively included in the
study. The LiMAx test was performed on days 0, 2, 5 and 10 after sepsis
onset and was compared with ICG test and liver-specific laboratory
parameters. Primary endpoint was the mortality rate after 90 days.
Secondary endpoint was the comparison with the ICG test.
Results The LiMAx test showed low results initially with increasing
values on days 5 and 10. The 90-day mortality rate in patients with a
low LiMAx test on day 2 (<100 ug/kg/hour) was significantly higher
than in patients with a LiMAx test >100 ug/kg/hour. The LiMAx test
was comparable with the ICG test. Patients with indication for renal
replacement therapy during hospital treatment showed significantly
lower LiIMAx values than patients without dialysis. See Figure 1.
Conclusion With the LiMAx test we can detect a liver dysfunction in
septic patients early on days O to 2. The LiMAx test is equal with the
ICG test and a result of <100 ug/kg/hour on day 2 suggests a low
probability of survival in septic patients.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P404 (doi: 10.1186/cc12342)

Introduction Liver dysfunction — in correlation to the severity of
functional impairment - but also any increase in portal pressure per
se (hepatorenal reflex) can induce alterations in renal function and
ultimately result in hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). In this prospective
investigation we determined the impact of liver resection on portal
venous pressure by measuring the hepatic venous pressure gradient
(HVPG), on concentrations of vasoactive peptides and on renal function.
Methods Twenty patients (mean age 66.3 years) undergoing elective
liver resection surgery because of malignant tumor were assessed
and grouped according to resection size: (Group 1) hemihepatectomy,
n = 13 versus (Group 2) segmentectomy, n = 7. HPVG was measured
before and after resection by canulation of a hepatic vein under
fluoroscopic guidance, liver function was assessed by the indocyanine
green plasma disappearance rate (ICG-PDR).

Results HVPG increased in Group 1 from 3.7 to 5.4 mmHg (P <0.05) and
decreased in Group 2 (4.8 to 4.3 mmHg, P = NS) (Table 1). Liver function
as assessed by ICG-PDR decreased in Group 1 by day 1 (18.5 to 15.3,
P <0.05) and remained stable in Group 2 (25.5 to 26.8, P = NS). Renin,
aldosterone, ADH, adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine increased
significantly (P <0.05) in Group 1 during operation. Group 2 showed
a significant rise only in ADH and dopamine. Acute kidney injury
occurred in five of 13 patients in Group 1 (P <0.05).

Introduction Partial liver grafting predisposes recipients to a unique
set of potential technical and anatomic complications that are
not prevalent in whole deceased donor grafts. We aimed to assess
the preoperative Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score,
postoperative 30-day clinical and laboratory follow-up, and detection
of the value of MELD score in predicting 30-day postoperative outcome
of LDLT recipients.

Methods A prospective multicenter registry involving 142 patients who
underwent LDLT from October 2004 to December 2010. Preoperative

MELD score was calculated: (0.378xlog (bilirubin) (mg/dl) + 1.120xlog
(INR) + 0.957xlog (creatinine) (mg/dl) + 0.643)x10 then rounded to
the nearest integer. Postoperative daily recording of all the clinical and
laboratory data was done for a period of 30 days.

Results The survival rate recorded in our study was 86.62%. The
most frequent complications were renal complications (86.6%),
pulmonary complications (73.9%), neurological complications (14%),
cardiovascular complications (12.6%), infectious complications (13.3%),
intra-abdominal infections (10.5%) and immunosuppressant toxicity
(7.7%). MELD score proved to be a good predictor of perioperative
outcome, patients with MELD score (>12) was associated with less
favorable outcome, accuracy was (80.3%).

Conclusion MELD score >12 was associated with less favorable
outcome with an accuracy of 80.3%.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P406 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12344)

Introduction Patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) are susceptible to a
variety of complications. Especially, infection disorders can reduce their
life expectancy markedly. The aim of this retrospective analysis was
to detect the incidence and prognosis in patients with LC and fungal
evidence (FE).

Methods A 3-year retrospective analysis of ICU patients with LC.
Patients with LC with/without FE were compared with a matched
control group based on comparable age and APACHE II score.
Specimens were collected based on clinical and/or laboratory
(infection signs) reasons and were analyzed by microbiological
standard methods.

Results A total of 101 patients with LC were enrolled in this analysis.
Basic data for both groups: Child-Pugh Score: 4*A, 18*B, 79*C; reason
for ICU admission: 28*hepatorenal syndrome, 18*SBP, 20*GI bleeding,
19*sepsis, 16* pneumonia; etiology of LC: 83*alcoholic, 8*NASH, 8*viral
(hepatitis B/C), 2*PSC. Fifty-five (54%) patients with LC had FE (mean age:
57.6 + 14 years, sex M/F: 40/15, APACHE II score 27 + 2). Compared with
the 46 patients with LC but without FE (mean age: 59.2 + 12 years, sex
M/F: 35/11, APACHE II score 23 + 4), these patients have a significantly
higher APACHE II score (27 + 2 vs. 23 + 4; P <0.001) and significantly
higher mortality (43/55 (78%) vs. 15/46 (33%); P <0.001). Multivariate
analysis showed that FE is associated with a higher mortality (P <0.001)
but is not associated with age, sex or CHILD score. Seventeen (31%) of
the 55 patients in the control group had FE (screening patients n = 147,
mean age 65.8 + 12 years, sex M/F: 35/20, APACHE Il score 26.5 + 3,
reason for ICU admission: 19*pneumonia, 16*sepsis, 9*intracerebral
haemorrhage, 7*acute abdomen, 4*lymphatic disorder). The mortality
rate was significantly lower (27/55 (49%) vs. 43/55 (78%); P = 0.003) as
compared with patients with LC and FE. The main localisation of fungal
was in both groups the lung (46 vs. 14), followed by urine (18 vs. 2),
blood culture (6 vs. 1) and ascites (4 vs. 0). Predominantly candida
species were detected (especially C. albicans/glabrata), five patients
in the LC group had aspergillus fumigatus. In LC patients, FE could be
detected in many cases in several compartments.

Conclusion ICU patients with LC have a high incidence of FE. The
mortality rate is therefore significantly higher as compared with
patients with LC without FE and also as compared with a control
group without LC. Therefore early antimycotic treatment should be
considered.

Introduction Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) requiring admission to an
ICU is associated with high mortality (hospital mortality reached 42%)

$152

and long lengths of stay [1]. Survival among patients with predicted
SAP at admission has been shown to correlate with the duration of
organ failure (OF) [2]. The systemic determinant of severity in a new
classification of acute pancreatitis (AP) is also based on identification of
patients with transient or persistent OF [3].

Methods The aim of the study was to retrospectively determine the
predictors of early persistent OF in ICU patients with SAP. The analysis
involved 152 patients. The median time interval between the onset of
AP and admission was 24 (9; 48) hours. The patients were divided into
two groups: the first group (n = 46) had transient OF and the second
group (n = 106) had persistent OF. The ability of the APACHE II score,
total SOFA score and number of organ/system failure to discriminate
transient from persistent OF was explored with receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves.

Results Hospital mortality was significantly higher in the second
group as compared with the first group (45% vs. 7%, P = 0.000); while
infectious complications were 39% versus 11% (P = 0.001) and median
lengths of ICU stay were 8 (5; 18) days for the second group and 6 (4; 7)
days for the first group (P= 0.001). Optimum cutoff levels (by ROC curve
analysis) were APACHE II score =12 (sensitivity 0.790; 1 - specificity
0.119), total SOFA score =4 (sensitivity 0.829; 1 — specificity 0.190), and
failure >2 organs/systems (sensitivity 0.819; 1 - specificity 0.214). See
Table 1.

Conclusion Persistent OF in ICU patients with SAP is associated with the

optimal management of ICU patients with SAP.

Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of
thrombopoietin (TPO) plasma levels as a biomarker of clinical severity
in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). TPO is a humoral growth factor
that stimulates megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation [1].
Furthermore, it favors platelet aggregation and polymorphonuclear
leukocyte activation [2]. Elevated plasmatic concentrations of TPO have
been shown in patients with critical diseases, including ACS, burn injury
and sepsis [2]. In particular, clinical severity is the major determinant of
elevated TPO levels in patients with sepsis [3]. AP is a relatively common
disease whose diagnosis and treatment are often difficult, especially in
the clinical setting of the emergency department (ED). About 20% of
patients with AP develop a severe form of the disease. In order to early
identify those patients affected by severe AP, several biomarkers have
been studied. No data regarding TPO plasma levels in patients with AP
are currently available.

Methods We enrolled patients with AP at the moment of the first
clinical evaluation in the ED. AP patients were classified as having mild
or severe forms of AP on the basis of the APACHE II score (28). TPO
concentrations were determined by ELISA.

Results We studied 41 patients with AP (17 severe and 24 mild
pancreatitis). No differences for gender and age were detected
between patients with mild and severe disease. TPO plasma levels
were significantly higher in patients with severe AP (99.33 + 23.68 pg/
ml) than in those with mild AP (50.81 + 6.73 pg/ml) (Figure 1). The
ROC curve led us to calculate a cutoff value of 51.55 pg/ml. This value
identified correctly 12 out of the 17 patients affected by severe AP.
Conclusion TPO may be proposed as biomarker of clinical severity
in patients with AP at the time of first evaluation in the ED. Further
studies, involving larger numbers of patients, are needed in order to
validate these preliminary data.

Introduction The objective was to evaluate the effect of the renal
dysfunction measured by pRIFLE on clinical outcome in children
admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).
Methods A retrospective cohort involving all children admitted
between August 2009 and July 2010 to a Brazilian PICU located in a
university-affiliated hospital. Patients were classified according to the
pRIFLE at admission as well the maximum pRIFLE during the PICU
stay. The endpoints were: length of stay (LOS) in the PICU, LOS on
mechanical ventilation, mortality rate quoted by predicted mortality of
the Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM2).
Results In total, 375 children were included in the study. A total 169
(45%) of them presented renal dysfunction according to the pRIFLE.
Renal injury and renal failure were associated with higher LOS in the
PICU and length of mechanical ventilation. The observed and predicted
mortality by PIM2 did not show differences. However, the more severe
renal presentation (Injury and Failure) was associated with higher
mortality rate and was not predicted by PIM2 (8% vs. 11%, P <0.01).
Conclusion Renal dysfunction measured by pRIFLE is a very common
finding (45%) among pediatric patients admitted to the PICU. The more
severe renal affection is associated with higher mortality, length of MV
and length of PICU stay.

Thorough evaluation for the new acute kidney injury criteria by
Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes

J Izawa, S Uchino, T Fujii, T Arii, T Fukushima, S Kawano

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P410 (doi: 10.1186/cc12348)

Introduction Two previous classifications of acute kidney injury (AKI)
that are known as RIFLE criteria and AKIN criteria have shown that
AKI is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Differences
in predicting ability for prognosis, however, have been reported. In
2012, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) created the
new AKI criteria, combining RIFLE and AKIN criteria. However, such a
combination might cause inconsistency among each definition in the
criteria. We have investigated all of the definitions in the new KDIGO
criteria in detail.

Methods This is a retrospective historical cohort study including adult
patients admitted to the ICU (Jikei University, Tokyo, Japan) between
January 2010 and October 2011. Patients undergoing chronic dialysis
were excluded. KDIGO criteria were applied to all patients to diagnose
AKI. Hospital mortality of patients with AKI diagnosed by the 10
definitions in the criteria was compared.

Results A total of 2,399 patients were evaluated. AKI occurred in 26.6%
with standard definition of KDIGO; 18.0% with creatinine criteria alone;
15.5% with urine output alone. By multivariable analysis, each AKI
stage was associated with hospital mortality: 5.6%, odds ratio 2.95, for
Stage 1; 10.1%, odds ratio 5.52, for Stage 2; 30.2%, odds ratio 21.30,
for Stage 3. Crude hospital mortality stratified by the 10 definitions
showed increasing trends with stage progression. Mortality of the
three definitions in Stage 1 was from 4.2% to 8.8%. Stage 2 had two
definitions and their mortality was 12.1% and 12.9%. Stage 3 had five
definitions and their mortality was from 20.5% to 55.6%.

Conclusion AKI defined by the new KDIGO criteria was associated
with increased hospital mortality. In addition, definitions in the KDIGO
criteria seem to be appropriate because of clear relations between
mortality and stage progression.

Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin as an early
predictor of acute kidney injury in cardiac surgery patients

T Garcia Rodriguez San Miguel

Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P411 (doi: 10.1186/cc12349)

Introduction To evaluate whether urinary neutrophil gelatinase-
associated lipocalin (UNGAL) detects acute kidney injury (AKI) earlier
than the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in cardiac surgery
patients.

Methods Two-hundred and seventy-four adult patients undergoing
cardiac surgery were consecutively included from February to
December 2011. Exclusion criteria were absence of diuresis due to
end-stage renal disease or chronic renal failure and a previous cardiac
catheterism with i.v. contrast use the week before surgery. Four serial
blood and urine samples immediately before (PRE) and after (POST)
surgery, and 1 day (1d) and 2 days (2d) after surgery were obtained.
UNGAL was measured in an Architect 6200 (Abbott Diagnostics). AKIN
criteria were used to diagnose AKI. The study was approved by the
local ethics committee and all patients gave informed consent. Delta
UNGAL was defined as the difference between the PRE and the POSTs
concentrations.

Results One-hundred and eighty-one patients (66.1%) were men;
mean age was 68.2 + 12.2 years. Valve replacement was performed
in 123, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in 81, valve surgery +
CABG in 48, cardiac transplant in five, aorta aneurism surgery in nine,
and other procedures in eight patients. ICU and hospital stays were
6.7 + 8.1 and 15.7 + 13.9 days, respectively. Renal replacement therapy
(RRT) was required in 16 patients (5.8%) within 48 hours of ICU stay and
in 28 patients (10.2%) within 4 weeks. Mortality at 28 days was 2.9%.
Eighty-six patients (31.4%) were diagnosed with AKI within 48 hours of
surgery. Area under the ROC curve of POST uNGAL for AKI diagnosis
was 0.72 (0.66 to 0.79) (P <0.0001) at an optimal cutoff value of 180 pg/I,

with 78.7% specificity, 64% sensitivity and 74.1% accuracy. UNGAL
advanced diagnosis of AKI in 44 patients (51.2%), whereas diagnosis
was achieved at the same time as AKI criteria in 11 patients; AKI criteria
outperformed uNGAL in only 36% of cases. Accordingly, UNGAL was
useful to diagnose postoperative AKI in 63.9% of cases. Median delta
UNGAL was 12.5 (from -1.9 to 71.1) and 154.5 (from 16.6 to 484.5) ug/l
in non-AKI and AKI patients, respectively (P <0.0001) and its area under
the ROC curve for AKI prediction was 0.70 (0.63 to 0.77) (P <0.0001).
Conclusion Compared with AKIN criteria, a urinary NGAL concentration
>180 ug/l anticipates AKI diagnosis in more than 50% of cardiac surgery
patients in the first 24 to 48 hours after intervention.

Atrial natriuretic peptide attenuates metabolic acidosis and
inflammation of the kidney, lung and heart in a rat model of renal
ischemia-reperfusion injury

Introduction Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a common
cause of acute kidney injury and occurs in various clinical conditions
including shock and cardiovascular surgery. Renal IRI releases
proinflammatory cytokines within the kidney. Atrial natriuretic peptide
(ANP) has natriuretic, diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects [1] and
plays an important role of regulating blood pressure and volume
homeostasis. The hypothesis was that renal IRI induces inflammation
not only in the kidney but also in remote organs such as the lung and
heart and ANP attenuates renal injury and inflammation in the kidney,
lung and heart.

Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with pento-
barbital. Tracheostomy was performed and rats were ventilated at VT
10 ml/kg with 5 cmH,O PEEP. The right carotid artery was catheterized
for blood sampling and continuous blood pressure measurements. The
right femoral vein was catheterized for infusion of saline or ANP. Rats
were divided into three groups; IRI group (n = 10), left renal pedicle was
clamped for 30 minutes; IRI+ANP group (n = 10), left renal pedicle was
clamped for 30 minutes, ANP (0.2 ug/kg/minute, for 3 hours 25 minutes)
was started 5 minutes after clamp; and Sham group (n = 6), the sham-
operated rats. Hemodynamics, arterial blood gas, and plasma lactate
levels were measured at baseline and at 1 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours after
declamp. The mRNA expression of IL-6 in the kidney, lung, and heart were

$154

measured. The kidney, lung and heart were immunostained to examine
the localization of IL-6 and NF-KB and assigned an expression score. The
wet/dry ratio of the lung was also measured.
Results Renal IRI induced metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, MRNA
expression of IL-6 in the kidney, lung and heart. Renal IRI increased
immunohistochemical localization of IL-6 in the proximal convoluted
tubule of the left kidney and NF-KB in the bronchial epithelial cells of
the lung. ANP attenuated metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema and
expression of IL-6 mRNA in the kidney, heart, and lung. ANP decreased
immunohistochemical localization of IL-6 in the left kidney and NF-KB
in the lung.
Conclusion These findings suggested that inflammation within the
kidney after renal IRI was extended into the lung and heart. ANP
attenuated metabolic acidosis and inflammation in the kidney, lung
and heart in a rat model of renal IRI. ANP may attenuate organ cross-
talk between the kidney, lung and heart.

Introduction Evidence suggests a nephroprotective effect of urinary
alkalinization in patients at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI).

Methods In a multicenter, double-blind, RCT we enrolled 350 adult
cardiac surgery patients. At induction of anesthesia, patients received
either 24 hours of intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate
(5.1 mmol/kg) or sodium chloride (5.1 mmol/kg). The primary endpoint
was the proportion of patients developing AKI.

Results Sodium bicarbonate increased urinary pH (from 6.0 to 7.5,
P <0.001). More patients in the bicarbonate group (83/174 (47.7%))
developed AKI compared with control (64/176 (36.4%), OR = 1.60
(95% Cl, 1.04 to 2.45); unadjusted P = 0.032). A greater postoperative

increase in urinary NGAL in patients receiving bicarbonate infusion
was observed compared with control (P = 0.011). The incidence of
postoperative RRT was similar but hospital mortality was increased
in patients treated with bicarbonate compared with chloride (11/174
(6.3%) vs. 3/176 (1.7%), OR 3.89 (1.07 to 14.2), P= 0.031). See Figure 1.
Conclusion On this basis of our findings we do not recommend the
use of perioperative infusions of sodium bicarbonate to reduce the
incidence or severity of AKI in this patient group.

Introduction Here, we compare the value of acute tubular damage
markers measured early in the course after cardiac surgery for
prediction of postoperative AKI compared with conventional markers
used in clinical routine for risk assessment of acute renal function loss.
Methods One hundred adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery in
the control arm of a RCT (NCT00672334) were analyzed. We quantified
the following biomarkers in urine: NGAL, hepcidin, midkine, IL-6, a.-
microglobulin; in plasma: NGAL, hepcidin, haptoglobin, CK, CKMB, CRP,
leukocytes, lactate, urea and creatinine.

Results Preoperatively, no biomarker predicted AKI. At ICU arrival, four
urinary tubular damage markers showed good discriminatory ability
(AUC =0.80) for subsequent development or absence of AKI (Figure 1).
An excellent predictive value was found for uNGAL/uhepcidin ratio
(AUC 0.90, Figure 1). This ratio combines an AKI prediction marker
(NGAL) and a marker of protection from AKI (hepcidin), potentiating
their individual discriminatory values. Contrarily, at ICU admission,
none of the plasma biomarkers was a good early AKI predictor with
AUC-ROC 20.80.

Conclusion Several urinary markers of acute tubular damage predict
AKI after cardiac surgery and the biologically plausible combination of
NGAL and hepcidin provides excellent AKI prediction.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P415 (doi: 10.1186/cc12353)

Introduction Furosemide is one of the most employed diuretics in
the ICU for its ability to induce negative water balance. However, one
common side effect is metabolic alkalosis [1]. We aimed to describe the
time course of urinary excretion and changes in plasmatic acid-base
balance in response to the administration of furosemide.
Methods We connected the urinary catheter of 39 ICU patients to
a quasi-continuous urine analyzer (Kidney INstant monitorinG®),
allowing measurement of pH (pHU), sodium, chloride, potassium
and ammonium concentrations (Na+U, CI-U, K+U, NH4+U) every
10 minutes. The study period lasted 3 hours after a single intravenous
bolus of furosemide (time 0). In 13 patients receiving two or more
administrations over a longer period (46 (26 to 49) hours), according to
clinical needs, we reviewed data on fluid therapy, hemodynamics and
acid-base balance from the beginning to the end of the observation.
Results Ten minutes after furosemide administration, Na+U and
CI-U rose from 65 + 6 to 140 + 5 and from 109 + 6 to 150 + 5 mEq/l
respectively, while K+U fell from 60 + 5 to 39 + 4 mEq/l (P <0.001 for
all electrolytes vs. time 0) with a consequent increase in urinary anion
gap (AGU = Na+U + CI-U — K+U). Urinary output increased from 10 (5
to 19) to 53 (29 to 71) ml/10 minutes (P <0.05). After the first hour Cl-U
remained higher than Na+U, which progressively decreased, leading
to a reduction in AGU and pHU over time. In parallel, a progressive
increment in NH4+U was observed. In patients receiving more than
one administration we observed an increase in arterial base excess
(1.8 + 0.8 vs. 5.0 + 0.6 mmol/l, P <0.001) and plasmatic strong ion
difference (SIDpl) (31 (30 to 33) vs. 35 (34 to 36) mEq/I, P=0.01) during
the study period. These changes were due to a decrease in plasmatic
Cl concentration (109.0 + 1.1 vs. 106.6 + 0.9 mEq/I, P= 0.009). Plasmatic
sodium and potassium concentrations did not change. In these
patients, considering the total amount of administered fluids and urine,
a negative water and chloride balance was observed (-460 + 403 ml
and -48 + 48 mEq, respectively).
Conclusion Furosemide acts immediately after administration, causing
a rise in urinary output, Na+U and Cl-U concentrations. Loop-diuretic-
induced metabolic alkalosis may be due to an increased urinary
chloride loss and the associated increase in SIDpl.

Red cell distribution width is not a predictor of mortality in acute
kidney injury

‘University of Glasgow, Uk; ’Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P416 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12354)

Introduction Given the significant morbidity and mortality associated
with acute kidney injury (AKI), there is a need to find factors to help
aid decision-making regarding levels of therapeutic support. As
a prognostic biomarker, the red cell distribution width (RDW) has
attracted interest in the setting of critical care when added to existing
scoring systems [1]. By examining RDW in a previously studied AKI
cohort, we aimed to evaluate the utility of this routine blood test.

Methods A cohort of 209 mixed critical care patients who received renal
replacement therapy for AKI had their demographic and biochemical
data retrieved from electronic databases. Outcomes were gathered for
ICU and hospital mortality. Incomplete datasets were discarded, leading
to 153 complete sets. RDW data were taken from the first sample after
admission to the ICU, as were all other biochemical values apart from
pre-RRT creatinine and potassium. Overall cohort characteristics were
gathered, and two groups were created: those with a RDW value within
normal range (<14.5%) and those with a greater than normal value

----$$$$----$$$$----
Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2
http://ccforum.com/supplements/17/S2

(>14.5%). We then further subgrouped RDW to assess the correlation
between rising levels and ICU mortality.
Results A total 77.1% of our cohort had a RDW greater than the normal
laboratory range at time of ICU admission. Key baseline characteristics
(age, APACHE II score, length of stay, ICU mortality) did not differ
significantly between patients with normal and abnormal RDW. When
subgroup analysis was performed, no statistically significant correlation
between rising RDW and ICU mortality was found (Spearman
correlation = 0.426, P = 0.233).
Conclusion In this cohort of critically ill patients with AKI, RDW was
not found to be a predictor of mortality. Our results contradict those of
recent studies [1,2]. However, both groups of RDW patients in our study
suffered a higher ICU mortality than in other studies. To further explain
these findings, we intend to perform multivariate logistic regression
analysis and assess the effect of social deprivation on RDW.

Value of Tc-99m DMSA renal scan in assessing the prognosis and
outcome of acute renal failure due to sepsis

Introduction Acute renal failure (ARF) is a common complication in
patients admitted to the ICU. Sepsis is also a well-known risk factor for
the development of ARF. The combination of ARF and severe sepsis was
reported to carry a mortality up to 70% whereas the mortality of ARF
alone is 40 to 45%. The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of renal
perfusion scanning in detecting the prognosis and outcome of patients
with acute renal failure due to sepsis.

Methods Forty patients with acute renal failure due to sepsis, aged
between 15 and 74 years, were enrolled in the study. They were
monitored for their ICU prognosis and outcome after doing renal
perfusion scanning. All patients were subjected to routine ICU and
laboratory investigations including APACHE II and SOFA score.

Results Thirty patients had normal renal scan and 10 patients had
abnormal renal scan. The mortality percentage was higher among
abnormal renal scan cases (three out of 10, 30%) compared with cases
with normal renal scan (seven out of 30, 23.3%) with nonsignificant
P value: 0.6. The median length of stay/day in ICU was longer among
nonsurvivors than survivors 15.5 + 10, 11.5 + 8, P value: 0.058
(approaching significance). APACHE II score was higher in nonsurvivors
than survivors 23.9+ 3.2, 19.6+ 4.2, P value: 0.0001. The percentage of
mortality among cases that needed mechanical ventilation was higher
(nine out of 16, 56.3%) compared with mortality cases that did not
need mechanical ventilation (one out of 24, 4.2% with P value: 0.0001).
Conclusion ARF may exert an independent adverse effect on outcome
in septic and septic shock patients. It is also a risk factor for mortality.
Tc-99m DMSA scanning is useful for detecting renal dysfunction and
help to predict the outcome and prognosis.

Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) complicates over 50% of ICU
admissions. Episodes of AKI are a major risk factor for development
or progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, methods of
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may be poorly calibrated

to survivors of critical illness who may have reduced muscle mass. We
hypothesized that eGFR may underestimate rates and severity of CKD
in ICU survivors.

Methods A retrospective observational study of renal function in all
patients admitted to a London teaching hospital ICU for =>5 days and
surviving to hospital discharge in 2011. We excluded cases with current
or new diagnosis of end-stage renal disease or renal transplant. We
assessed AKI in ICU by KDIGO 1 criteria and hospital discharge eGFR by
the CKD-EPI equation. For comparison we assumed a normal GFR in a
healthy individual as 120 ml/minute/1.73 m? at age 20 decreasing by
0.8 per year over age 20.

Results We identified 282 patients, 180 of whom had AKI. Median age
was 50 and 68% were male. Median hospital discharge serum creatinine
was 57 umol/I (range 16 to 654), median eGFR was significantly higher
than predicted normal GFR for age at 115 versus predicted 95 (P <0.001,
median difference 16). In patients who had not had AKI discharge the
eGFR was 119 versus normal predicted 98 (P <0.001, median difference
19), suggesting that eGFR could be overestimating true GFR in our
population by at least a factor of 1.23 (Figure 1). Applying this correction
factor to eGFRs of patients who had recovered from AKI resulted in 44%
more diagnoses of CKD (eGFR <60) at hospital discharge (36 vs. 25).
Conclusion eGFR may overestimate renal function in survivors of critical
illness confounding identification of CKD in this at-risk population.
Prospective studies with measurement of actual GFR are required to
assess the burden of CKD in survivors of critical illness.

Introduction Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is an independent
predictor of renal impairment and mortality [1]. Organ dysfunction
caused by the pressure effect of IAH is well understood, but how this
is modified in the presence of bowel obstruction is unclear. The aim
of this study was to determine how different [AH models cause renal
dysfunction in a pig model.

Methods Twenty-four pigs were divided into three groups; a control
group (n = 5), a pneumoperitoneum (Pn) (n = 10), and an intestinal
occlusion (Oc) model (n = 10). IAP was maintained for 3 hours at
20 mmHg during which time creatinine, urea, urine output, potassium,
and glomerular filtration pressure (GFP) were measured. Statistical
analysis was performed using repeated-measures ANOVA.

Results Over the first 3 hours there was a statistically significant
difference between the control group and both IAH models for

potassium (P = 0.002), urea (P = 0.045), creatinine (P = 0.012), GFP
(P <0.001), and urine output (P=0.003). Over the full 5-hour period there
was a Statistically significant difference in the potassium measurement
between the Pn and the Oc model (P = 0.01). The other parameters did
not show a significant difference: urea (P=0.171), creatinine (P=0.074),
GFP (P =0.141), and urine output (P = 0.242).
Conclusion As expected the IAH models resulted in significantly worse
renal function after 3 hours. This early renal dysfunction may be as a
result of an early inflammatory process that has been associated with
the pathophysiology of acute kidney injury. Potassium was significantly
elevated in the Pn group as compared with the Oc group. Early changes
in potassium levels with [AH may be a marker of early renal dysfunction
and the usefulness of other renal biomarkers, such as NGAL, prompts
further investigation.

Renal resistive index can predict response to furosemide in septic
patients with oliguria

| Gornik, A Godan, V Gasparovic

University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Croatia

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P420 (doi: 10.1186/cc12358)

Introduction Oliguria is common in septic patients and is frequently
therapeutically addressed with loop diuretics; that is, furosemide.
Diuretic treatment in shock and hypovolemia is not rational, but can
be tried in oliguric patients with normovolemia or hypervolemia and
without hypotension. In such patients it still does not always increase
dieresis and can also be harmful. The resistive index is a measure of
pulsatile blood flow that reflects the resistance to blood flow caused by
the microvascular bed distal to the site of measurement. It can reflect
functional status of the tissue distal to the point of measurement. We
investigated whether measuring the renal resistive index (RI) could
be helpful in determining which patients will respond to furosemide
treatment.

Methods We included medical ICU patients with sepsis and oliguria (urine
output <1 ml/kg/hour) who were prescribed i.v. furosemide. Patients with
known chronic renal failure, hypovolemia (CVP <10 mmHg) or severe
hypotension (MAP <80 mmHg) were excluded. Resistive index (1 — (end
diastolic velocity / maximum systolic velocity)x100) was measured
in at least three segmental arteries of both kidneys, the average of all
measurements was reported as the result. Repeated assessments were
viewed as independent if separated by more than 24 hours. Furosemide
was given intravenously in the dose of 40 mg after RI measurement.
Positive response to furosemide was defined as doubling of hourly dieresis
or achieving urine output >1.5 ml/kg/hour after drug administration.
Results We included 47 patients with a total of 59 measurements. In
28 cases patients had positive response to furosemide. Median RI in
responders was 0.67 (range 0.55 to 0.78) and in nonresponders 0.79
(range 0.58 to 0.81); P = 0.027. Construction of receiver operating
characteristic curve showed 83% sensitivity and 81% specificity for the
cutoff RI 0.73. No other measured patient characteristic was found to
be predictive of response to diuretic treatment.

Conclusion Our results show that the RI could be used to guide diuretic
treatment in nonhypovolemic, nonhypotensive septic patients. Further
studies are needed to confirm those preliminary results.

Introduction As a proof of concept, the potential added value of chitinase
3-like 1 (CHI3L1) as a more early and specific diagnostic parameter for
acute kidney injury (AKI) was investigated in adult ICU patients that
underwent elective cardiac surgery.

S157

Methods A prospective single-center cohort study started in May 2012
in an academic cardiac surgery ICU. Blood and urine were collected
preoperatively (baseline), at ICU admission and at several time points
until 48 hours after ICU admission. Patients of age <18 years were
excluded, as well as patients with AKI based on the KDIGO sCr and urine
output criteria, patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 and/or
with recent renal transplantation (<3 months before cardiac surgery).
AKI was defined on KDIGO sCr criteria only. Baseline sCr was assessed as
the sCr concentration measured before start of cardiac surgery. Urinary
CHI3L1 was normalized to urinary creatinine. For both serum and urine
CHI3L1, we measured changes from baseline. Data are expressed as
median (interquartile range), and number (%).

Results Data for 17 patients (nine males, eight females) were generated
for interim analysis. Five patients (29.4%), of which four were females,
developed AKI KDIGO class 1. AKI patients were older compared
with non-AKlI patients (82.0 years (77.5 to 83.5) vs. 66.5 (60.3 to 75.8);
P = 0.002). The baseline sCr did not differ significantly between the
AKI (1.12 mg/dl (0.80 to 1.15)) and non-AKI (0.90 mg/dl (0.86 to 1.01);
P = 0.383) group. Baseline serum CHI3L1 was highly variable in both
AKI and non-AKI patients. Moreover, no trend towards a higher serum
CHI3L1 level in AKI versus non-AKI patients was observed either at
baseline or during the study follow-up. In contrast, the increase in the
urinary CHI3L1 to urinary creatinine ratio from baseline was higher in
the AKI versus non-AKI group at time points 4 hours and 6 hours after
admission to the ICU (2.00 ng/mg Cr (1.38 to 3.03) vs. 0.26 (0.05 to 0.88);
P = 0.002, resp. 2.47 (1.09 to 7.26) vs. 0.23 (-0.18 to 0.74); P = 0.006)
and, more importantly, occurred before the diagnosis of AKI by sCr
(>16 hours after ICU admission).

Conclusion This interim analysis of an ongoing pilot study, with 300
ICU patients in three cohorts (general ICU, pediatric and adult cardiac
surgery ICU), shows promising results for urinary CHI3L1 (ng/mg Cr) as
an early diagnostic biomarker for AKI in adult ICU patients that undergo
elective cardiac surgery.

Use, type and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass are related to
acute kidney injury occurrence and urinary NGAL concentrations

Introduction To analyze whether variables related to cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB) influence acute kidney injury (AKI) occurrence and urinary
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (UNGAL) in cardiac surgery
patients.

Methods A total of 274 adult cardiac surgery patients were consecu-
tively included from February to December 2011. Exclusion criteria
were absence of diuresis due to end-stage renal disease or chronic
renal failure and cardiac catheterism with i.v. contrast in the week
before surgery. CPB, when performed, was used as standard CPB
(SCPB) or MiniCPB. We obtained four serial blood and urine samples,
immediately before (PRE) and after (POST) surgery, and 1 day (1d)
and 2 days (2d) after surgery. UNGAL was measured by Architect 6200
(Abbott Diagnostics). AKIN criteria were used to diagnose AKI. The
study was approved by the local ethics committee and all patients gave
informed consent.

Results One hundred and eighty-one patients (66.1%) were men; mean
age was 68.2 + 12.2 years. ICU and hospital stays were 6.7 + 8.1 and
15.7 + 13.9 days, respectively. Twenty-eight-day mortality was 2.9%.
Eighty-six patients (31.4%) were diagnosed with AKI within 48 hours
after surgery. In total, 219 patients required CPB (195 SCPB, 24 MiniCPB)
and 55 did not (no-CPB). Seven no-CPB patients (12.7%) developed AKI
and their median UNGAL POST was 330 (42.6 to 489.9) ug/l compared
with 13.6 (6.9 to 38.3) ug/l in the 48 patients without AKI (P <0.0001).
Of the 195 patients undergoing SCPB, 76 (38.9%) developed AKI and
119 did not; POST UNGAL was 204 (34.8 to 575.7) ug/l and 44.5 (13.2 to
175.8) yg/I (P <0.0001), respectively. In the 24 patients under MiniCPB,
POST uNGAL was 113 (58.8 to 211.8) ug/l in those (three patients, 12.5%)
developing AKl and 19.1 (9.2 to 41.8) ug/lin those without AKI (P=0.01).
Aortic clamp time (r = 0.31, P <0.0001) and cardiopulmonary bypass
time (r = 0.30, P <0.0001) correlated with POST uNGAL concentrations.

----$$$$----$$$$----
Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2

Incidence of AKI in patients without CPB or with MiniCPB was identical
and significantly lower (P <0.0001) than in SCPB patients.

Conclusion The incidence of AKI was higher in patients undergoing
SCPB. Aortic clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass time correlated with
the POST uNGAL concentration. The higher values found in patients
without AKI undergoing SCPB suggest that a subclinical AKI, only
detectable by uNGAL, could exist in this group.

Symmetrical dimethylarginine is a more sensitive biomarker of
renal dysfunction than creatinine

Introduction Current definitions of acute kidney injury (AKI) are based
upon changes in serum creatinine (SCr) concentration and urine
output: both have limitations in patients with AKI. Diagnosis may be
delayed if using these criteria alone. We have previously validated a
method of measuring the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) intended for
use in patients with AKI (a continuous infusion of very low dose iohexol;
CIVLDI). In this study we compare the performance of symmetrical
dimethylarginine (SDMA) against SCr and CIVILDI. SDMA is the
structural isomer of the endogenous nitric oxide inhibitor asymmetrical
dimethylarginine. SDMA increases in parallel with SCr. Despite this,
no formula exists to estimate GFR from SDMA concentration. Tubular
secretion of SCr may be as high as 40%. SDMA may be a more sensitive
biomarker of renal dysfunction than SCr; however, the tubular
reabsorption of SDMA is unknown. The aims were to compare the
performance of SDMA against SCr and accurately measured GFR, and
to derive a formula to estimate GFR from SDMA concentration.
Methods Seventeen volunteers had GFR measured twice via measuring
the clearance of a 5 mli.v. bolus of iohexol, or CIVLDI. Serum and urine
iohexol, Cr and SDMA were measured by high-performance liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ms/ms) at 10 time
points. Fractional excretion of SDMA and SCr were calculated using
iohexol as the denominator. SDMA was plotted against measured GFR,
and estimated GFR equations were derived from linear, quadratic and
third-order polynomial plots.

Results Mean GFR measured by single injection was 78.7 + 28.5 ml/
minute/1.73 m?, and 78.9 + 28.6 ml/minute/1.73 m* when measured
by CIVLDI (P = 0.82). Mean SDMA concentration was similar on both
occasions (641 + 38 vs. 623 + 22 nmol/l; P= 0.68). Tubular reabsorption
of SDMA was lower in subjects with GFR <60 ml/minute/1.73 m/?
(12 + 8% vs. 18 + 8% in subjects with GFR >60 ml/minute/1.73 m7;
P = 0.0002), and tubular secretion of SCR was higher in subjects with
GFR <60 ml/minute/1.73 m? (29% vs. 23%; P <0.0001). The third-order
polynomial equation (r = 0.93) estimated GFR better than quadratic
(r = 0.92) and linear (r = 0.87) equations. Bland-Altman comparison
revealed no bias when the third-order equation was used (precision:
+20 ml/minute/1.73 m?”).

Conclusion SDMA appears to be an accurate and precise estimate of
GFR and a more sensitive biomarker of renal dysfunction than SCr. We
predict SDMA will perform better than SCr as a biomarker of AKI. This
forms the basis of a future study.

Introduction Outcome of ICU patients is predicted by multifactorial
scores such as APACHE II and SOFA. Furthermore, markers of single
organ failure such as the extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) and
several biomarkers of acute kidney injury (AKI) have been associated

$158

with mortality. Regarding a delayed increase in creatinine, other
biomarkers of AKI including neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin
(NGAL) have been suggested. It was the aim of our study to compare
the predictive capabilities of NGAL and transpulmonary thermodilution
(TPTD)-derived parameters within 48 hours after ICU admission.
Methods Urinary NGAL, serum creatinine and BUN as well as TPTD-
derived parameters were measured O hours, 12 hours, 24 hours and
48 hours after ICU admission. Primary endpoint: prediction of ICU
mortality. Secondary endpoint: requirement of renal replacement
therapy (RRT). Statistics: ROC-AUC. IBM SPSS 20.

Results There were 91 patients (34 female, 57 male), 65 + 14 years,
APACHE II score 20.6 + 8.3, SOFA score 9.3 + 4.2. Etiology: 10 ARDS,
36 sepsis, 22 cirrhosis, six pancreatitis, eight cardiogenic shock, two
CNS-affections, seven various. Mortality was best predicted by SOFA
(ROC-AUC: 0.747; P <0.001) and APACHE II (AUC: 0.705; P <0.001).
Among admission parameters of renal function only NGAL significantly
predicted mortality (AUC: 0.647; P = 0.023), whereas creatinine
(P = 0.290) and BUN (P = 0.067) were not predictive. ROC-AUCs for
NGAL further increased after 12 hours (0.659), 24 hours (0.691; P = 0.01)
and 48 hours (0.728; P = 0.004). NGAL on admission also predicted
requirement of RRT during the ICU stay (AUC: 0.678; P = 0.015), which
was also predicted by creatinine (AUC 0.688; P = 0.010) and BUN
(AUC: 0.649; P = 0.043). Among baseline TPTD parameters, only the
pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) significantly predicted
mortality (AUC: 0.700; P = 0.007). The EVLWI (AUC 0.628; P = 0.083)
slightly failed significance. Cardiac index, global end-diastolic volume
index and heart rate were not predictive. Furthermore, PVPI was the
only TPTD-derived parameter to predict requirement of RRT (AUC:
0.693; P =0.009).

Conclusion Urinary NGAL on admission significantly predicts mortality,
whereas creatinine and BUN were not predictive. The predictive
capabilities of NGAL further increased after 12 hours, 24 hours and
48 hours, with the ROC-AUC of NGAL 48 hours exceeding the AUC of the
APACHE II score. NGAL on admission also predicts requirement of RRT.
Among TPTD-derived parameters, PVPI on admission is significantly
associated with mortality and requirement of RRT.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P425 (doi: 10.1186/cc12363)

Introduction Growing evidence hints that bidirectional interaction
between heart failure and kidney disease and renal insufficiency
is a strong predictor of mortality as well as causally linked to the
progression of heart failure. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin
(NGAL) is an early predictor of acute kidney injury (AKI). We evaluated
the impact of NGAL on morbidity and mortality in patients with acute
heart failure.

Methods Seventy-six patients presenting with symptoms consistent
with acute heart failure (median age 72 years, 56% male) were enrolled.
Plasma NGAL levels were measured by an ELISA at admission and
compared with the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and B-natriuretic
peptide (BNP) levels. The primary outcome was AKI development
defined by RIFLE criteria (fall in GFR >25% or creatinine rise =>50%
from baseline, or a fall in urine output <0.5 ml/kg/hour) and secondary
outcomes were duration of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality.
Results AKI developed in 11 patients (14.4%). The subgroup that during
hospitalization developed renal dysfunction had increased NGAL
values with respect to patients with preserved renal function (146 + 42
vs. 84+ 24ng/ml, P<0.05). NGAL significantly associated with admission
eGFR (r= 0.72, P<0.01) and BNP levels (r = 0.80, P <0.01). For prediction
of AKI, NGAL >140 ng/ml has been related to renal insufficiency with
sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 74% with area under the receiver
operator curve of 0.70 (0.58 to 0.82). In the follow-up setting, NGAL was
associated with recurrent hospital admission for heart failure (HR: 3.1,
Cl: 1.5 to 6.2) and cardiac death (HR: 2.2, Cl: 1.8 to 4.5).

Conclusion NGAL is emerging as a promising biomarker of AKI in the
setting of acute heart failure and elevated NGAL levels indicate a poor
prognosis in this population regarding morbidity and mortality.

Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin predicts postoperative
fluid overload after cardiac surgery

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P426 (doi: 10.1186/cc12364)

Introduction Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL),
measured early after cardiac surgery, has been demonstrated to predict
postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI). Fluid overload potentially
masks a subsequent acute renal function loss through dilution of
serum creatinine and maintenance of urine output just above AKI-
defining criteria.

Methods We investigated the early postoperative value of NGAL
versus that of simultaneously measured serum creatinine to
predict subsequent fluid overload. We studied 100 adult cardiac
surgery patients in the control arm of a RCT (NCT00672334). Severe
postoperative fluid overload was defined as positive fluid balance
>10% of preoperative body weight within 48 hours after surgery.
Results Severe postoperative fluid overload was present in 5% of
patients with a mean positive fluid balance of 15.8 + 9.5 I. At ICU
admission, urine NGAL predicted severe fluid overload (AUC-ROC 0.82
(95% Cl =0.70 to 0.94)) (Figure 1) and mortality (AUC 0.88 (0.78 to 0.97)).
Serum creatinine measured at the same time did not predict severe
fluid overload (AUC 0.52 (0.26 to 0.79)) or mortality (AUC 0.61 (0.16 to
0.99)).

Conclusion Early NGAL-guided adjustments to fluid management
may reduce organ edema after cardiac surgery. Findings should be
validated in larger cohorts.

Survivors of acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement
therapy rarely receive follow-up: identification of an unmet need

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P427 (doi: 10.1186/cc12365)

Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in more than 50% of
ICU admissions, requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) in around
10% of cases. There is now increasing evidence that AKI is a risk factor
for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease
(CKD); however, when AKI occurs as a complication of critical illness
appropriate follow-up may be neglected. Accordingly, we reviewed the
follow-up of renal function in all patients who received RRT on our ICU
and survived to hospital discharge.

Methods A retrospective audit of patients who received RRT in a central
London adult critical care unit during 2011.

Results Of 921 patients admitted, 203 received RRT with 109 surviving
to hospital discharge. We excluded 52 patients who had end-stage
renal disease, renal transplant or known glomerular disease. Of the
remaining 57 AKI patients, median age was 60 (range: 18 to 77) and
37 (65%) were male. Median discharge creatinine was 74.5 umoll/|
(27 to 662). Forty-two (74%) were offered follow-up, but in only six
cases (11%) was this to nephrology services. Twenty-eight attended
follow-up (five to nephrology) at a median time of 6 weeks; however,
creatinine was measured at in only 14 and in six of these it had risen (by
median 16.5 mol/l). In addition, 14 patients had creatinine measured
3 to 6 months post discharge and in eight it had risen (by median
31.5 umol/I).

Conclusion Follow-up of patients who received RRT for AKI in the
ICU was poor and they were rarely referred to nephrologists. Where
renal function was measured after discharge, there was evidence of
progressive renal dysfunction; however, renal function was often not
assessed. We propose an algorithm for clinicians to guide follow-up.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P428 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12366)

Introduction AKI is a common occurrence in sick hospitalized patients,
in particular those admitted to intensive care. Published data suggest
that 4 to 5% of all critically ill patients develop severe AKI and require
initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) [1,2]. Such patients have
high mortality rates often exceeding 60% [2]. We aimed to review
the outcomes of patients admitted to the ICU and required renal
replacement therapy for AKI. We examined whether aetiology of AKI,
comorbidity burden, hospital length of stay and treatment in ICU had
any significant association with survival in the study cohort.

Methods During 2009, 56 patients were identified to have received RRT
with AKI who were admitted to the ICU at the Royal Wolverhampton
Hospitals NHS Trust. Computerised and paper-based case records were
examined for these patients to collect the data. AKIN classification was

and 27 females. Thirty-one (55.4%) patients had sepsis and 20 (35.7%)
patients had ATN as the main cause of AKI. Thirty-two patients (57%)
had three organ failures at the time of commencement of RRT. Forty-
six patients (82.1%) received haemofitration only. Thirty-two (57%)
patients died, with more than 80% of these occurring in the ITU. There
was no significant difference in survival when compared with duration
of haemofiltration, length of stay, number of organs failed and number
of comorbidities. However, significantly more patients that died had
AKI due to sepsis (P = 0.003) or if they received mechanical ventilation
(P = 0.48) or inotropes (0.04). Of the 27 patients who survived until
discharge from hospital, 18 (66.7%) had normal renal function, eight
(29.6%) had AKIN stage | and only one patient required maintenance
haemodialysis.
Conclusion Individuals who develop dialysis-dependent AKI in the
ICU setting in general terms either die or recover. Sepsis is the most
common association with death. The need for mechanical ventilation
and inotropic therapy are both associated with increased incidence of
death.

Introduction This study was to evaluate the efficiency of the early start
of intermittent substitutive renal therapy in patients with polytrauma
complicated by multiple organ failure syndrome.

Methods Forty-two patients with polytrauma complicated by
multiple organ failure syndrome were included in the study. The age
of the patients was from 20 to 60 years (38.3 + 1.6 years average). All
patients were divided into two equal groups. In the control group
(CG) the criteria for the start of the substitutive renal therapy were:
hyperkalemia >6 mmol/l, plasma creatinine =>280 umoll/I, diuresis
<20 ml/hour. In the investigation group (IG) there were subtests to
carry out the substitutive renal therapy, allowing one to start it in
the earlier period of the multiple organ failure progression. These are
increase of Na* >150 mmol/l, osmolarity >300 mOsm/I, elevation of
the plasma toxicity according to the average molecule concentration
>1.0, diuresis decrease <40 ml/hour. These were examined: lethality,
quantity of the substitutive renal therapy procedures, mechanical lung
ventilation duration (MLV), intensive care and hospital duration. The
substitutive renal therapy was carried out by AK-200-Ultra apparatus
(Gambro, Sweden). The statistical analysis was realized using Statistica
6.1 and the Mann-Whitney U test.

Results The average quantity of the substitutive renal therapy
procedures in the CG was 13.4 + 0.7, in the IG it was 8 + 0.6 (P <0.05).
The recuperation of the renal excretory functions was on 19 + 1 day in
12 patients of the CG, and on 11 + 1.3 day in the IG, from the moment
of substitutive renal therapy start (P <0.05). Lethality in the CG was
43% (nine patients), and in the IG it was 29% (six patients, P <0.05). The
duration of the MLV in the CG and IG was 21 + 1.2 days and 16 + 1.2,
respectively (P <0.05). In the IG the duration of the ICU was lower by
23%, hospitality duration was lower by 17% (P <0.05).

Conclusion The efficiency of the substitutive renal therapy depends
directly on the hydroelectrolytic and metabolic changes and toxicosis
degrees in the polytrauma complicated by multiple organ failure
syndrome. The early start of the dialysis methods treatment allows
one to achieve the earlier recuperation of the renal functions and to
decrease the lethality level by 14%.

Can treatment with the molecular adsorbent recirculation system
be the solution for type-1 hepatorenal syndrome?

L Lavayssiere

University Hospital, Toulouse, France

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P430 (doi: 10.1186/cc12368)

Introduction The aim of this retrospective study was to determine
whether the molecular adsorbent recirculation system (MARS) can
improve renal function in HSR1 patients.
Methods Thirty-two patients with chronic liver disease and HRS1 were
treated by MARS sessions that were performed every other day. The
endpoint was renal function improvement by 28 days after diagnosis
of HRS1 that was defined as a serum creatinine level <133 umol/l.
Partial renal recovery was defined as a 10% decrease in baseline serum
creatinine level.
Results The mean number of MARS sessions required by each patient
was 3.5 + 1.5. The median time between admission and the start
of MARS therapy was 3 (0 to 15) days. Of the total patients, 13 (40%)
had improved renal function. Among these, nine (28%) had complete
renal recovery. Among the patients that survived, only 40% (6/15) had
improved renal function. When MARS was started, 53% of patients had
failed renal failure according to RIFLE criteria. Seven patients received
a liver transplant after diagnosis of HRS. Of these, four had complete
or partial recovery after transplantation (57%) versus nine of the 25
patients who did not undergo liver transplantation (36%), P = NS. The
28-day survival rate was 47%.
Conclusion MARS therapy improved renal function in only very few
patients with HRS1. Even if liver transplantation is the best option, MARS
could be used as a bridge until transplantation. Some authors argue
that prolonged duration of dialysis (>1 month) before transplantation
may result in chronic renal failure probably because there are two
etiologies of AKI in end-stage liver disease: acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
and real functional renal failure. ATN before liver transplantation has
been identified as a risk factor for patients’ mortality and chronic renal
failure at 1 and 5 years post liver transplantation. Further prospective
controlled studies including large number of patients are required.

Introduction The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of
intermittent venovenous high-volume hemofiltration (IHVHF) on
extravascular lung water, respiratory function and cytokine removal
in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated
with postoperative multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in severe
abdominal infection patients.

Methods Thirty patients with severe abdominal infection and
ARDS were randomized into the IHVHF group (n = 15) and control
group (n = 15). All patients were mechanically ventilated. The IHVHF
technique with a rate of 100 to 120 ml/kg/hour during 6 to 8 hours was
used. The PiCCOplus system was used to monitor cardiac output (CO),
extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) and intrathoracic blood volume
index (ITBVI). Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO.), arterial partial
pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO,), oxygenation index (PaO,/FiO.)
and dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), oxygen delivery and oxygen
consumption were measured. Serum concentrations of TNFa, IL-6, IL-8

and lactate were measured by ELISA method. The APACHE II scores
before and after IHVHF therapy were detected.

Results All indexes in the control group did not show any significant
improvement before and after treatment (P <0.05). There was a
significant decrease of serum concentrations of TNFa, IL-6, IL-8 and
lactate, increase of CO and decrease of EVLWI 24 hours after IHVHF
(P <0.05). The indexes of oxygen delivery, consumption, PaO, and Cdyn
improved significantly, PaO,/FiO, increased markedly compared with
those before IHVHF and the control group. Significant differences were
detected in all of the hemodynamics and oxygen indexes (P <0.05).
Conclusion IHVHF presents with a significant beneficial effect on
respiratory function in patients with ARDS as a result of removal
of cytokines, decrease in EVLWI, improvement of hemodynamic
parameters, and correction of disturbances in oxygen balance. IHVHF
adjuvant treatment for ARDS reduces pulmonary edema, improves
PaO./FiO, and Cdyn and mechanical ventilation parameters. IHVHF
may be a promising treatment for ARDS in postoperative multiple
organ dysfunction syndrome in severe abdominal infection patients.

Dialyzer clearance of myoglobin with middle molecule filter and
low blood flow CVVHD in patients with rhabdomyolysis-associated
acute kidney injury

Introduction Rhabdomyolysis-associated acute kidney injury can be
treated with various modes of renal replacement therapy (RRT) [1,2].
We have used continuous venoveno hemodialysis (CVVHD) with
middle molecule filter and low extracorporeal blood flow (100 to
180 ml/minute) to avoid albumin loss and hemodynamic instability.
Methods We treated nine patients suffering from rhabdomyolysis and
acute kidney injury with various causes. We used a CVVHD mode with
low (100 to 180 ml/minute) blood flow and a middle molecule filter
(Ultraflux EMiC2; 1.8 m? surface area, polysulfone membrane, cutoff at
40 kDa, blood filling volume 130 ml, blood flow range 100 to 350 ml/
minute, maximum dialysate flow 1,000 ml/minute). Myoglobin and
albumin concentrations were measured from prefilter and postfilter
samples and dialyzer clearances were calculated (CLdial = blood
flowxCpre —- Cpost/Cpre + UFxCpre/Cpost). Measurements were taken
at 0, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 4 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours and
48 hours from the start of the CRRT or until CRRT was no longer needed.
Results The baseline and prefilter plasma albumin concentrations varied
from 8 to 29 g/l. Postfilter and post-treatment albumin concentrations
remained comparable. Prefilter concentrations of myoglobin (17.8 kDa)
varied from 96,109 to 747 g/l and the dialyzer clearance of myoglobin
from 50.6 to 0 ml/minute. The mean dialyzer clearance was 23.1 ml/
minute and the median clearance 22.2 ml/minute. Maximal changes
between corresponding prefilter and postfilter samples were: absolute
concentration change 27,091 ug/l, percentage 34%, dialyzer clearance
50.6 ml/minute. Clearances were achieved with low extracorporeal
blood flow between 100 and 180 ml/minute, most commonly 120 ml/
minute. Ultrafiltration (UF) was used only at five of the 56 time points
calculated, because of hemodynamic instability. All patients required
either vasopressor or vasopressor and inotrope support. The highest
dialyzer clearance of myoglobin (50.6 ml/minute) was measured at the
prefilter myoglobin of 29,266 yg/I, blood flow 180 ml/ml and no UF.
Conclusion In a rhabdomyolysis-associated kidney injury a middle
molecule filter and a low blood flow CVVHD offer a safe and effective
treatment choice for patients requiring vasopressor or vasopressor and
inotrope for hemodynamic support.

Daily fluid balance predicts hospital mortality in critically ill patients
receiving continuous renal replacement therapy

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P433 (doi: 10.1186/cc12371)

Introduction It has been suggested that fluid balance is a biomarker
in critically ill patients [1]. There is a paucity of randomized trials
examining the effect of daily fluid balance on outcomes in patients
on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The RENAL trial did
not find mortality difference with higher CRRT dose [2], but did not
investigate the effect of daily fluid balance on patient outcomes. A post
hoc analysis suggested survival benefit in patients with negative fluid
balance [3]. In this study, we hypothesize that daily fluid balance is an
independent predictor of mortality in critically ill patients.

Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study in eight ICUs of
a tertiary academic center. We constructed a robust clustered linear
regression model of daily fluid balance and all-cause hospital mortality
among 595 critically ill patients receiving CRRT. We adjusted the model
for the Charlson comorbidity score, the daily SOFA scores in the first
week after initiation of CRRT as well the type of ICU.

Results After adjusting for the type of ICU and the daily severity
of illness, patients who died had on average 779 ml higher daily
fluid balance compared with patients who survived (P <0.001, 95%
Cl = 385 to 1,173 ml, Figure 1). Severity of illness predicted daily fluid
accumulation; each additional point of the SOFA score predicted an
additional 57 ml of extra daily fluid (P = 0.002).

balance and intradialytic hypotension with mortality and recovery of
renal function.

Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients
aged =16 years who had RRT initiated and continued for =2 days in a
level 2 or 3 ICU at two academic centres, and had fluid balance data
available. Patients with end-stage kidney disease, within 1 year of
a renal transplant or who had RRT initiated to treat a toxic ingestion
were excluded. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine
the relationship between mean daily fluid balance over the first
7 days following RRT initiation and the outcomes of mortality and RRT
dependence in survivors.

Results A total of 522 patients were included (319 male, mean age
64 years); 264 (50.6%) died in hospital. Survivors and those who died
were similar with respect to age, weight and incidence of heart failure,
liver cirrhosis and primary renal diagnoses. Independent risk factors for
hospital mortality were higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
score at RRT initiation (odds ratio (OR) = 1.18, 95% confidence
interval = 1.11 to 1.25), higher Charlson comorbidity index (OR = 1.22,
1.09 to 1.37), lower baseline creatinine (OR = 0.984 per 10 umol/I,
0.970 to 0.998), lower minimum mean arterial pressure (MAP) on day 1
(OR = 0.81 per 10 mmHg, 0.66 to 0.95) and more positive fluid balance
for the first 7 days (OR 1.03 per 100 ml, 1.02 to 1.05). Of 172 hospital
survivors, 57 (33.1%) were RRT dependent at discharge. Although
univariable analysis suggested lower SOFA scores and higher baseline
serum creatinine levels in those who remained RRT dependent,
no factor was independently associated with RRT dependence at
discharge in a multivariate model.

Conclusion In this cohort of patients with AKI requiring RRT, a more
positive fluid balance over 1 week and lower initial minimum MAP
were associated with mortality. Among survivors, a less positive fluid
balance was not associated with increased risk of RRT dependence at
discharge, suggesting that conservative fluid management does not
significantly attenuate renal recovery.

Introduction Esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, and ranitidine, a
histamine-2 receptor antagonist are frequently used in intensive care
patients requiring stress ulcer prophylaxis. Continuous venovenous
hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) is an important extracorporeal renal
replacement therapy in critically ill patients suffering from multiple
organ failure. This study investigates the pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of esomeprazole and ranitidine in anuric critically
ill patients undergoing CVVHDF.

Methods Esomeprazole 40 mg was administered intravenously
once daily in nine intensive care patients and ranitidine 50 mg was
administered intravenously three times daily in nine intensive care
patients with acute renal failure undergoing CVVHDF who required
stress ulcer prophylaxis. The concentration of esomeprazole and
ranitidine in serum and _ ultradiafiltrate was determined by high-
performance liquid chromatography. The intragastric pH was obtained
via intragastric pH-metry.

Results The mean peak prefilter concentration, AUC, ,,, volume of
distribution, half-life, total clearance and hemodiafiltration clearance of
esomeprazole were 6.9 umol/I, 30.6 umol.hour/I, 53.3 |, 2.0 hours, 1.4 I/
hour and 0.2 |/hour, respectively. In the ranitidine group the mean peak
prefilter concentration, AUC, ,, volume of distribution, half-life, total
clearance and hemodiafiltration clearance were 5.5 umol/I, 12.0 umol.
hour/I, 91.4 |, 14.4 hours, 5.8 | and 1.3 |, respectively. Median time of

S162

intragastric pH >5 and median intragastric pH decreased significantly
in the ranitidine group over time (P <0.05) but not in the esomeprazole
group.

Conclusion Although pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole and raniti-
dine are only little influenced by CVVHDF, we found a significant
decrease of intragastric pH in patients treated with ranitidine. Esome-
prazole may be superior for long-term stress ulcer prophylaxis in
critically ill patients undergoing CVVHDF.

Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of
critical illness and sepsis [1]. Dosing of antibacterial agents in septic
patients is complicated by altered pharmacokinetics due to both
acute renal failure and critical illness [2]. Current dosing regimens for
administration of gentamicin and vancomycin to septic patients with
AKI on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) at a filtration rate
of 45 ml/kg/hour are missing.

Methods Seventeen septic patients with AKI treated with vancomycin
and seven patients with gentamicin on CVVH were included. In the
vancomycin group, patients received the first dose of 1.0 g intravenously
followed by 1.0 g/12 hours if not adjusted. In the gentamicin group,
patients received a loading dose of 240 mg followed by a maintenance
dose every 24 hours. The vancomycin maintenance dose was optimized
to achieve AUC, ,,/MIC =400 (Cmin >10 mg/l), gentamicin target was
Cmax/MIC of 8 to 10. Maintenance doses were adjusted according to
drug level simulation using a pharmacokinetic programme.

Results The median vancomycin total clearance (Cltot) was 0.89 and
0.55 ml/minute/kg on the first and second day of the study. CRRT
clearance accounted for about 50 to 60% of vancomycin Cltot found
in a population with normal renal function (0.97 ml/minute/kg).
Vancomycin serum concentrations after the first dose were below the
required target of 10 mg/I as early as 6 hours in 10 patients. AUC, ,,/
MIC =400 ratio was achieved in 67% of patients on the first day. The
median gentamicin Cltot was 0.68 and 0.79 ml/minute/kg on the first
and second day of the study. CRRT clearance accounted for about 50%
of gentamicin Cltot found in a population without renal impairment
(0.73 ml/minute/kg). The target Cmax/MIC ratio was achieved in 78% of
patients after the first dose.

Conclusion CVVH at a filtration rate of 45 ml/kg/hour leads to high
removal of both antibiotics. Due to rapid change in patient's clinical
status it was impossible to predict a fixed dosage regimen. We
recommend administration of unreduced loading dose and: blood
sampling as early as 6 hours after first vancomycin dose; blood
sampling 30 to 60 minutes after gentamicin administration and before
the next dose; and the maintenance dose should be based on drug-
level monitoring.

CRRT. The aim was to evaluate the effects on electrolyte and acid-base
status of anew RCA-CVVH protocol using an 18 mmol/l citrate solution
combined with a phosphate-containing replacement fluid, compared
with a previously adopted RCA-CVVH protocol combining a 12 mmol/|
citrate solution with a conventional replacement fluid.

Methods Until September 2011, RCA-CVVH was routinely performed
in our centre with a 12 mmol/I citrate solution and a postdilution
replacement fluid with bicarbonate (HCO, 32, Ca** 1.75, Mg** 0.5, K*
2 mmol/l) (protocol A). In cases of metabolic acidosis, not related to
inappropriate citrate metabolism and persisting after optimization of
RCA-CVVH parameter setting, bicarbonate infusion was scheduled.
Starting from September 2011, in order to optimize buffer balance
and to reduce the need for phosphate supplementation, a new
RCA-CVVH protocol has been designed using an 18 mmol/l citrate
solution combined with a recently introduced phosphate-containing
replacement fluid with bicarbonate (HCO, 30, phosphate 1.2, Ca** 1.25,
Mg?* 0.6, K* 4 mmol/l) (protocol B).

Results In 30 cardiac surgery patients with AKI, acid-base status
and electrolytes have been evaluated comparing protocol A (20
patients, running time 5,283 hours) versus protocol B (10 patients,
1,170 hours) (median (IQR)): pH 7.40 (7.36 to 7.44) versus 7.43 (7.41
to 7.47) (P <0.0001), bicarbonate 22.1 (20.9 to 23.5) versus 24.4 (23.2
to 25.6) mmol/l (P <0.0001), base excess —3.1 (—4.6 to -1.15) versus 0
(-1.5 to 1.1) (P <0.0001), systemic Ca** 1.16 (1.1 to 1.23) versus 1.14
(1.08 to 1.19) mmol/l (P <0.0001), phosphate 0.7 (0.5 to 1) versus
1.1 (0.9 to 1.4) mmol/l (P <0.0001). Protocol A required bicarbonate
infusion in 90% of patients (6 + 6.4 mmol/hour) and sodium phosphate
supplementation in all cases (4.1 + 2.4 g/day). A lower amount of
phosphate supplementation (0.9 + 2 g/day) was needed in 30% of
patients undergoing protocol B while bicarbonate infusion was never
required. Filter life was comparable (51.8 + 36.5 vs. 46.8 + 30.3 hours,
P=NS).

Conclusion Protocol B provided a buffer balance more positive than
protocol A and allowed one to adequately control acid—base status
without additional bicarbonate infusion and in the absence of alkalosis,
despite the use of a standard bicarbonate concentration replacement
solution. Furthermore, the combination of a phosphate-containing
replacement fluid appeared effective to prevent hypophosphatemia.

Muscle wasting in the ICU can be reliably monitored using
ultrasound

H Jorgensen', B Nedergaard?, T Gilsaa’

'Lillebaelt Hospital, Kolding, Denmark; ?Odense University Hospital,
Svendborg, Denmark

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P439 (doi: 10.1186/cc12377)

Introduction The aim of this study was to establish the intraobserver
and interobserver variation of ultrasonographic measurements of the
rectus femoris muscle cross-section area (RF-CSA). Muscle wasting is
frequent in the ICU, affecting more than one-half of the patients with
severe sepsis [1]. Muscle mass reduces rapidly, and 15 to 20% is lost
within the first week [1]. To monitor muscle mass, ultrasound has the
benefits of being both readily available in the ICU and non-invasive.
Ultrasonographic measurement of RF-CSA has an almost perfect
correlation with MRI (mean interclass correlation (ICC) = 0.999) [2] and
RF-CSA is linearly related to maximum voluntary contraction strength
in both healthy subjects and COPD patients (r = 0.78) [3].

Methods The study had two purposes: to determine the intraobserver
variation for RF-CSA by one observer scanning 15 healthy adult
volunteers three times each at 2-day intervals; and to determine the
interobserver variation for RF-CSA by two observers each scanning 15
adult ICU patients on the same day. Patients were in a supine position,
legs in passive extension. The transducer was placed perpendicular
to the long axis of the right thigh over the RF, two-thirds of the

$163

distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the superior patellar
border [1]. RF-CSA was calculated by planimetry. At each scan, three
measurements were made. For intraobserver variation, the 3x3
scans were analyzed using the interclass correlation coefficient. For
interobserver variation, the three measurements from each observer
were averaged and compared using Bland-Altman statistics.

Results Intraobserver variation: 15 healthy adults, age 39.6 + 2.4 years,
weight 66.8 + 2.3 kg, sex three male/12 female. ICC: 0.996 (95% Cl: 0.990
to 0.998). Interobserver variation: 15 ICU patients, age: 77 + 8.3 years,
weight: 71.3 + 9.1 kg, sex nine male/six female. Bland-Altman: bias:
-—0.07 cm?, 95% limits of agreement —0.188 to 0.048 cm?.

Conclusion Ultrasonographic measurement of RF-CSA is easily
learned and quickly performed. It has a very low intraobserver and
interobserver variation and can be recommended as a reliable method
for monitoring muscle wasting in the ICU.

Critical illness induces nutrient-independent adipogenesis and
accumulation of alternatively activated tissue macrophages

Introduction In artificially fed critically ill patients, adipose tissue
reveals an increased number of small adipocytes and accumulation of
M2-type macrophages [1]. We hypothesized that nutrient-independent
factors of critical illness explain these findings, and also that M2-
macrophage accumulation during critical illness may not be limited to
adipose tissue.

Methods We performed a randomized investigation in a septic mouse
model of critical illness and a study of ICU patient biopsies. In the
critically ill mouse, we compared the effect of parenteral nutrition
(n = 13) with fasting (n = 11) on body composition, adipocyte cell
size, and macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue, liver and lung.
Fed healthy control mice (n = 11) were studied for comparison. /n
vivo adipose tissue was harvested after 1 week of illness from human
patients (n = 40) who participated in a RCT on early parenteral nutrition
versus tolerating nutrient restriction [2], adipose tissue morphology
was characterized and compared with healthy controls (n = 13).
Results Irrespective of nutritional intake, critically ill mice lost body
weight, total fat and fat-free mass. Part of the fat loss was explained
by reduced ectopic fat accumulation. Adipocyte cell number and
the adipogenic markers peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
y and CCAT/enhancer binding-protein 8 increased with illness, again
irrespective of nutritional intake. Macrophage accumulation with
predominant M2-phenotype was observed in adipose tissue, liver and
lungs of critically ill mice, further accentuated by fasting in visceral
tissues. Macrophage M2-markers correlated with chemoattractant
factor expression in all studied tissues. In human subcutaneous
adipose tissue biopsies of critically ill patients, increased adipogenic
markers and M2 macrophage accumulation were present irrespective
of nutritional intake.

Conclusion Adipogenesis and accumulation of M2-macrophages are
hallmarks of critical illness, irrespective of nutritional management
in humans and mice. Critical illness evokes macrophage polarization
to the M2-state not only in adipose tissue but also in liver and lungs,
which is further accentuated by fasting.

Hypocalcemia during magnesium therapy for obstetric ICU
admissions

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P442 (doi: 10.1186/cc12380)

Introduction Intravenous magnesium sulfate is commonly used
in obstetric patients with pre-eclampsia. Following a case of acute
symptomatic hypocalcemia we retrospectively examined a cohort of
patients to investigate the frequency of hypocalcemia.

Methods Obstetric patients were identified from the ICU admissions
database and divided into two groups - those treated with magnesium
(for suspected pre-eclampsia) and those admitted for other obstetric
indications (postpartum hemorrhage, infection, etc.). The baseline
calcium values were compared, as well as the lowest and discharge
values. Albumin and magnesium values were also compared. All
comparisons used Student's t test.

Results Data were collected on 88 parturients admitted over 2 years
including 40 (45%) who received magnesium and 48 (55%) who did not.
Magnesium-treated women were younger (age: 31 + 7 vs. 36 + 5 years,
P = 0.02). The baseline calcium concentrations were similar for the
two groups (2.2 + 0.2 vs. 2.2 + 0.1 mmol/l, P = 0.85). Patients receiving
magnesium had _ significantly higher magnesium concentrations
(2.1 + 0.4 vs. 0.7 + 0.2 mmol/l, P <0.001), and significantly lower
calcium concentrations during therapy (1.6 + 0.3 vs. 1.9 + 0.3 mmol/l,
P <0.001). At discharge, the calcium levels were closer (magnesium
treated 1.9 + 0.2 vs. untreated 2.1 + 0.1 mmol/l, P = 0.02). The albumin
concentrations did not differ between the two groups (magnesium
treated 27 + 13 vs. nontreated 33 + 23 g/l, P = 0.134). Normal values:
calcium 2.15 to 2.55 mmol/I, magnesium 0.7 to 0.95 mmol/l, albumin
35 to 50 g/l.

Conclusion Magnesium therapy was associated with hypocalcemia.
Potential causative mechanisms include a renal excretion interaction
and magnesium-induced suppression of parathyroid hormone
secretion. Physicians should be aware of the potential for symptomatic
hypocalcemia during magnesium therapy.

Hyponatremia and intensive care outcome

P Dean, R Docking, D Govenden, A Davidson, A Mackay
Victoria Infirmary, Glasgow, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P443 (doi: 10.1186/cc12381)

Introduction Disorders of sodium (Na*) and water homeostasis are
common in hospitalised patients. Hyponatremia in particular has
been associated with worse hospital outcome and length of stay
[1]. We aimed to define the incidence of hyponatremia (serum Nat
<134 mmol/l) in our intensive care population and to determine
whether it was associated with ICU outcome or length of stay.
Methods Demographics, APACHE II score, outcome data and admission
sodium were retrieved from the Ward Watcher system in the Victoria
Infirmary ICU for 2,440 consecutive admissions from January 2005 to
present. We divided patients into three groups depending on serum
Na* (<134 mmol/I, 135 to 144 mmol/l, =>145 mmol/l) and compared
APACHE II score, length of stay and ICU outcome between patients
with a low versus a normal serum Na’*. Data were analysed using the
chi-squared test, Student's t test and the Mann-Whitney test where
appropriate.

Results Of the 2,440 patients studied, 1,993 had APACHE II data and
serum Na* recorded and so were included for analysis. In total, 453
patients (22.7%) had a serum Na* <134 mmol/l and 1,388 patients
(67.1%) had a serum Nat of 135 to 144 mmol/l. Patients with a low Na*
had a higher mortality (OR = 1.48, 95% Cl = 1.16 to 1.90, P <0.001), a
higher APACHE Il score (22 vs. 19, P <0.001) and higher mean age
(60 years vs. 58 years, P <0.001) than patients with a normal serum Na’.
Mean length of stay of patients with low serum Na* was also longer
(5.1 days vs. 4.6 days) although this was not statistically significant
(P = 0.09).

Conclusion In summary, hyponatremia is a useful index of severity of
illness in our ICU population. Whether this is a direct adverse effect

S164

of low serum sodium levels, or if hyponatremia is simply a marker for

‘sicker’ patients, is not known.

Strong ion gap can be accurately estimated with a simple bedside
equation

George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA
Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P444 (doi: 10.1186/cc12382)

Introduction The anion gap (AG) is used routinely in the assessment
of metabolic acidosis, but can be misleading in patients with
hypoalbuminemia and other disorders commonly encountered in
intensive care. This approach to acid-base analysis relies on assessment
of pH, pCO,, sodium, bicarbonate and chloride, and can lead to
underestimation or overestimation of the true electrochemical status
of a patient, as it does not include important ions such as lactate,
calcium, magnesium, and albumin. The strong ion gap (SIG) is an
alternative to the AG and is based upon Stewart's physical chemistry
approach. However, the SIG is cumbersome to calculate. As such, a
number of shortcut equations have been developed in an effort to
approximate the SIG. We sought to compare three such equations, the
Kellum corrected anion gap (KellAGc), the Moviat equation, and EZSIG,
in an effort to evaluate precision and accuracy [1-3].

Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of consecutive
patients admitted to the ICU of George Washington University Medical
Center from September 2010 to March 2011. Of the 1,516 patients
screened, 200 met inclusion criteria, which included availability of all
laboratory components to calculate the SIG, obtained within 1 hour of
each other. Demographic data and serum values for pH, pCO,, albumin,
lactate, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, magnesium,
phosphate, and calcium were collected. The AG, SIG, KellAGc, EZSIG,
and Moviat equations were subsequently calculated and compared
using Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman analysis.

Results The mean SIG was 3.25 + 3.5. Mean values for KellAGc, Moviat,
and EZSIG were 4.5 + 5.0, 1.77 + 2.2, and 3.6 + 3.7, respectively. Pearson
correlation coefficients for KellAGc, Moviat, and EZSIG when compared
with the SIG were r = 0.77, P = 0.0001; r = 0.88, P = 0.001; and r= 0.89,
P=0.001, respectively. In Bland-Altman analysis, the mean bias for the
test equations versus the SIG were: KellAGc (1.25), Moviat (-1.48), and
EZSIG (0.40).

Conclusion While all three equations correlated highly with the SIG,
the EZSIG and Moviat outperformed the KellAGc in Pearson and Bland-
Altman analysis. The EZSIG had a smaller bias than the Moviat equation
and a slightly better correlation (0.89 vs. 0.88). In the assessment of
critically ill patients, EZSIG is a candidate scanning equation for the
measurement of the SIG when all SIG components are not available.

Introduction Relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) is an uncommon
disorder among burn patients, which can often go unrecognized.
However, there are no or almost no data about the incidence of this
disease in burns. The goal of the current study is to evaluate the
incidence of RAI in burn patients during the acute phase.

Methods A _ prospective study, approved by our Institutional
Ethics Committee, was conducted in a 20-bed adult burn ICU at a

university-affiliated teaching hospital in Tunis. Patients admitted within
the first 24 hours post burn with greater than 10% total body surface
area (TBSA) burned were enrolled in this study from 1 January 2009
to 30 June 2010. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, history of adrenal
insufficiency, or steroid therapy within 6 months prior to burns. A
short corticotrophin test (250 ug) was performed, and cortisol levels
were measured at baseline (CS TO) and 60 minutes post test. Adrenal
insufficiency was defined by a response <9 ug/dl. Relative adrenal
insufficiency was further defined by a baseline cortisol >20 ug/dl.
Results Patients were assigned into two groups: G1 (RAI, n = 7) and G2
(absence Al, n = 11). Comparative study of the two groups shows the
results presented in Table 1.

Conclusion RAI is common in severely burned patients during the
acute phase, and is associated with shock. Further prospective
controlled studies will be necessary to establish risk factors of RAI in
severely burned patients and its impact on their prognosis.

Albumin-adjusted calcium concentration should not be used to
identify hypocalcaemia in critical illness

Introduction Hypocalcaemia is common in critical illness and accurate
assessment is crucial. Small studies have shown that albumin-adjusted
calcium (adjCa) does not accurately predict the ionised calcium (iCa)
concentration in critically ill patients, yet adjCa continues to be widely
used [1]. We investigated the reliability of using adjCa to identify
hypocalcaemia in a large, diverse population requiring intensive care.
Methods In a retrospective study of patients admitted to the ICUs of a
tertiary care hospital between January 2008 and 2012, iCa and pH were
extracted from routine blood gas results and total calcium, albumin
and phosphate from routine biochemistry results. adjCa was calculated
using a formula derived from and validated on the local population
[2]. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values
(PPV and NPV) and area under the curve (AUC) of adjCa for predicting
hypocalcaemia (iCa <1.1 mmol/l) were calculated.

Results Data from 1,038 patients were included. Admission iCa
was available for 976 (94%) patients. A total of 539 (55%) were
hypocalcaemic (iCa <1.1 mmol/l). adjCa was available for 1,031 (99%),
with 602 (58%) classified as hypocalcaemic (adjCa <2.2 mmol/l). adjCa
<2.2 mmol/I had sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 63% for detecting
iCa <1.1 mmol/l. The best previously published formula had an AUC of
0.81 (95% Cl = 0.78 to 0.83), compared with an AUC of 0.78 (0.75 to 0.81)
for the locally validated formula [1]. It was hypothesized that albumin,
pH or phosphate derangements could affect the proportion of albumin-
bound calcium and the performance of adjustment formulae. Albumin
concentration was not correlated with the difference between adjCa
and iCa. Weak but statistically significant correlations were found for pH
(r= 0.164; P <0.001) and phosphate (r = 0.135; P <0.001). The sensitivity
and specificity of adjCa <2.2 mmol/I for detecting hypocalcaemia did
not improve when looking at patients with normal pH (sensitivity
60.4%; specificity 69%) or phosphate (32.2%; 78.9%).

Conclusion adjCa is a relatively poor predictor of iCa in critically
ill patients. This cannot be explained by abnormalities of albumin,

$165

phosphate or pH. With direct iCa measurements now readily available

on ward-based analysers, adjCa should not be used to determine

calcium status in critical illness.

Introduction Vitamin D status may affect hospital mortality and
infectious complications in critical illness.

Methods A total of 655 mixed critically ill patients with available
25(OH)D levels hospitalized between 2008 and 2010 were included.
Cox regression analysis adjusted for SAPS 2, age and gender was
performed. 25(OH)D levels were categorized by month-specific tertiles
(high, intermediate, low) to reflect seasonal variation. Primary endpoint
was the correlation between 25(OH)D and hospital mortality. Secondary
endpoints were sepsis mortality and blood culture positivity.

Results Hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients in the
low (HR = 1.98) and the mid-range tertile (HR = 1.88) compared with
the highest tertile. Vitamin D levels were significantly lower in patients
with lethal sepsis compared with other causes of death (12.3 + 5.0
vs. 18.2 + 11.2, P = 0.02). Blood culture positivity rates did not differ
between the groups (23.0% vs. 26.8% vs. 17.3%, P = 0.361). See Table 1.

Table 1 (abstract P447)

Lethal sepsis 11 (5.1%) 9 (4.1%) 0 (0.0%) 0.005

Conclusion Low 25(OH)D status is predictive of all-cause and sepsis
mortality in the critically ill. Interventional studies are needed to
investigate the effect of vitamin D on mortality and sepsis incidence
and outcomes.

Etiology of low testosterone levels in male patients with severe
sepsis requiring mechanical ventilation

Introduction Low testosterone levels are frequently found in critically
ill male patients. The etiology and clinical significance is still poorly
understood. In the present study we have investigated the kinetics
and pathophysiology of altered gonadal hormone synthesis in male
patients with severe sepsis and respiratory failure.

Methods All male patients with severe sepsis and respiratory failure
who were admitted to the ICU of a large teaching hospital in the
Netherlands between September 2011 and June 2012 were included.
Steroid hormone levels were measured on days 1, 3 and 7.

Results In total, 18 patients were included. The mean age was
69 + 2 years, mean weight 76 + 2 kg, APACHE II score 23 + 2 and most
patients suffered from pneumosepsis. On the first day of intubation,
total and free testosterone levels were extremely low in most patients
and remained low during the first week (Figure 1). 17B-Estradiol levels
were elevated on day 1 and decreased during the first week. LH and

FSH levels were inappropriately low. All lipoprotein fractions and their
apo-proteins were reduced as well as 17-OH-progesterone, DHEA and
DHEAS. In contrast, androstenedione (adione) levels were elevated.
This suggests preferential and stimulated synthesis of androstenedione
(Figure 2). The high 178-estradiol levels indicate that androstenedione
is shunted into the estrogen pathway, a process that requires high
aromatase activity. The high estradiol/total testosterone ratio supports
this conclusion.

Conclusion Hyperestrogenic hypotestosteronemia is a frequent
finding in the acute phase of severe sepsis in male patients with
respiratory failure. It is suggested to be caused by decreased androgen
production and shunting of androgen to estrogen synthesis as a result
of increased aromatase activity. The clinical relevance of gonadal
hormone substitution needs further study.

Introduction The aim of the study is to examine the efficacy of calcium
replacement in patients with hypocalcaemia in the ICU. Hypocalcaemia
affects between 15 and 50% of admissions to the ICU [1].

Methods Adjusted calcium results <2.0 mmol/l were followed up
from admission for 5 days or until discharge or death. On each day

the adjusted calcium result and the calcium replacement were
documented. Adequate replacement is defined as 40 ml of 10%
calcium gluconate if the adjusted calcium is <2.0 mmol/| and 20 ml of
10% calcium gluconate if the adjusted calcium result is between 2.0
and 2.15 mmol/l.

Results Eighty-eight adjusted calcium results were <2.0 mmol/l. In 74
results adequate replacement was given and the average increase in
calcium was 0.2 mmol/l. This led to an increase in the adjusted calcium
to >2.15 mmol/I in 36% of results and improvement to >2.0 mmol/I
in 89% of results. In 14 results no replacement was given and the
average increase in calcium was 0.07 mmol/I, which equated to 57%
of calcium results remaining <2.0 mmol/l. Unpaired t test showed a P
value of 0.0006. A total of 150 adjusted calcium results were between
2.0 and 2.15 mmol/l. In 111 results adequate replacement was given
and the average increase was 0.006 mmol/l. The adjusted calcium
fell to <2.0 mmol/l in 26% of results and normalised to >2.15 mmol/l
in 23%. Where the adjusted calcium fell despite replacement, 51%
of results were below 2.05 mmol/l. In 39 results no replacement was
given, leading to an average fall in calcium of 0.03 mmol/l. Thirty-
three percent of calcium results fell to <2.0 mmol/l and 20% of results
normalised. Unpaired t test showed a P value of 0.07.

Conclusion Calcium replacement with 40 ml of 10% calcium gluconate
is effective when the adjusted calcium is <2.0 mmol/l. Replacement
with 20 ml of 10% calcium gluconate when the adjusted calcium
is between 2.0 and 2.15 mmol/l is not much more effective than no
replacement. This suggests that either replacement is not needed or
there is under-replacement in mild hypocalcaemia. Adjusted calcium
may be giving falsely low calcium results in mild hypocalcaemia. The
measurement of ionised calcium is a possible solution [2,3].

this study is to describe the endogenous blood melatonin valuesinICU = >
patients and their correlation with clinical parameters. 4 * p<0.05 vs. 0 mg/l (between groups)

Methods Seventy-three high-risk critically ill patients mechanically
ventilated for >48 hours were enrolled. Blood samples for melatonin
assay were collected between the 3rd and the 8th day of the ICU stay.
Melatonin was determined by radioimmunoassay and ELISA. The
peak and the area under the curve (AUC) calculated for each patient
were correlated with the clinical parameters using the regression for
quantiles test.

Results Endogenous melatonin was found lower in critically ill patients
compared with healthy subjects (Figure 1), although it showed a
great individual variability and it generally maintained a night-time
increase. In the univariate analysis the peak was found related to: blood
creatinine (P = 0.034); patients in coma (P = 0.024); hospital mortality
(P = 0.016). The AUC was found related to: SAPS II (P = 0.047); creatinine
(P <0.001); AST (P <0.001); ALT (P <0.001); hospital mortality (P <0.022).
Peak and AUC were found higher in nonsurvivor patients.

Conclusion In accord with previous studies, the endogenous blood
melatonin was found reduced in ICU patients. The higher melatonin
peak in renal failure may be due to an increased distribution volume;
greater AUC in patients with liver failure could be due to a less efficient
removal of the hormone from the systemic circulation. The finding of
increased peak and AUC in nonsurvivor patients could be due to a
hormonal response increased by the body stress reaction, potentially
similar to cortisol [1], or to a higher production of a physiological
antioxidant [2] with a decreased ability to use it.

Methods Platelet-rich-plasma was incubated for 72 hours with
metformin at a final concentration of 0 mg/I (control), 1.66 mg/l
(therapeutic dose) or 166 mg/I (toxic dose). Platelet VO, was then
measured with a Clark-type electrode, in the presence of glutamate plus
malate (complex | electron donors) (final concentration: 20 mmol/I for
both) or succinate (complex II electron donor) (30 mmol/l), before and
after adding cyanide (40 mmol/l). Mitochondrial (cyanide-sensitive)
and extra-mitochondrial (cyanide-insensitive) VO, were corrected for
platelet count.

Results The main results, from four preliminary experiments, are
shown in Figure 1. In the presence of glutamate plus malate, only
platelets incubated with a high dose of metformin had a mitochondrial
VO, significantly lower than controls. In the presence of succinate,
mitochondrial VO, of controls did not change significantly whereas
that of platelets incubated with metformin did. The effect of succinate
tended to become larger as the dose of metformin was increased from
O up to 166 mg/I (0.3 + 0.2 vs. 0.6 + 0.3 vs. 1.0 + 0.3 nmol/minute*10°
cells) (P = 0.068). Even so, mitochondrial VO, of platelets incubated with
the highest dose of metformin did not return to the levels of controls.
Extra-mitochondrial VO, was always the same.

Introduction Metformin, widely used as an antidiabetic drug, activates
the AMP activated protein kinase, a key regulator of the metabolism
providing protection under fuel deficiency. Chronic metformin therapy
has been shown in long-term follow-up clinical studies to reduce
cardiovascular mortality [1]. In animal experiments, acute metformin
pretreatment has been shown to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury
on cardiomyocytes [2]. We want to evaluate whether outcomes are
affected in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

Methods We performed a retrospective case-control study on 341
patients admitted exclusively for CABG surgery with cardiopulmonary
bypass between January 2006 and April 2012. Eighty-one patients
chronically on metformin were matched 1:3 with nonmetformin-
treated ones using gender, age, body mass index and number of
arterial bypass grafts. Global mortality, |CU-free 28 postoperative days
and creatinine kinase MB (CKMB) at postoperative baseline, 8 and
18 hours post baseline were compared.

Results Metformin-treated patient mortality was not significantly
lower than in nonmetformin (1.2% vs. 3.1%, P = 0.24, Fischer exact test).
ICU-free 28 postoperative days were higher in the metformin group
(median 23.4 days; 95% Cl = 22.5 to 24.3) than in the nonmetformin
group (median 22.9 days; 95% Cl 22.3 to 23.5, P <0.04, Wilcoxon test).
Median CKMB levels at postoperative baseline were 21 versus 26 ng/ml
(P <0.003), at 8 hours were 22 versus 53 ng/ml (P <0.004) and 18 hours
post baseline were 21.5 versus 27.5 ng/ml (P <0.012). See Table 1.

CKMB T+8 hours (ng/ml) 22 53 <0.004
CKMB T+18 hours (ng/ml) 215 275 <0.012

Conclusion These data suggest that chronic preoperative treatment
with metformin is associated with lower CKMB levels at postsurgery
baseline, 8 and 18 hours post baseline with a shorter ICU stay in patients
receiving CABG surgery under extracorporeal circulation.

factors

Introduction Metformin, an oral hypoglycemic drug, belongs to the
biguanide class and is now generally accepted as first-line treatment in
type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially in overweight patients [1]. In some

$168

predisposing conditions, the use of metformin may result in metformin-

associated lactic acidosis (MALA), a rare adverse event associated with a

high mortality rate [2]. The aim of this study is to assess risk factors and

prognostic factors in patients with MALA.

Methods We conducted a retrospective study of patients with MALA

admitted to the ICU of ASL 2 Chieti between 1 January 2008 and

30 September 2012. The eligibility criteria were: diagnosis of diabetes

mellitus type 2, treatment with oral hypoglycemic drugs containing

metformin, increased anion gap metabolic acidosis (pH <7.35, HCO,
<22 mmol/l, lactate >5 mmol/l). For each patient we evaluated: sex,
age, home care, SAPS II score [3], blood tests.

Results Ten patients were selected, five males and five females, with a

mean age of 72.2. On admission, nine of 10 patients had a framework

of general illness and acute renal failure; one patient appeared with

a probable acute abdomen not subsequently confirmed on CT. Eight

patients had a state of dehydration resulting from gastroenteritis,

diarrhea, fever; two patients had taken NSAIDs in the days prior to
hospitalization. No patient, in these conditions, has discontinued
treatment with metformin. All patients showed a critical clinical
framework with a SAPS Il mean score of 77.5. Cardiovascular and
respiratory support was required in all cases. The hemogas analysis

showed that patients had a severe metabolic acidosis (mean pH = 6.96)

with increased plasma lactate (mean lactate = 15.93 mmol/l).

Prothrombin activity was normal in eight of 10 patients. The overall

mortality was 70%.

Conclusion Patient education on correct use of metformin is essential

to prevent MALA, specially in those clinical conditions of increased risk

(for example, acute renal failure), as recommended by the AIFA 2011

guidelines [4]. In our study, a higher plasma concentration of lactate

represents the main negative prognostic factor, as pointed out by

other studies [5]. The prothrombin activity, which is considered to be a

decisive prognostic factor in the study of Peters and colleagues [6], was

not impaired in patients with poor outcome.

Introduction Stress hyperglycemia in the critically ill is a complex
process in which insulin signaling is systematically hijacked to
provide energy substrate for metabolic priorities such as cell healing
or infection containment. Fluctuating levels of plasma glucose are
associated with increased mortality in the ICU [1]. We develop a
multiscale mathematical model that can characterize the severity of
stress hyperglycemia based on a fundamental understanding of the
signaling molecules involved.

Methods Insulin resistance following insult has been shown to be
driven primarily by the immune response via the cytokine IL-6 [2]. We
created a multiscale mathematical model that links circulating glucose
and insulin concentration dynamics from the extended minimal
model [3] to a cellular insulin response model [4] that captures insulin-
mediated glucose uptake in an insulin-responsive cell.

Results Inhibitory dynamics driven by IL-6 were incorporated into the
cellular model to attenuate an insulin signaling intermediate (insulin
receptor substrate 1) according to the proposed biological mechanisms.
The percentage reduction in glucose uptake as a function of IL-6
concentration was fit to data from patients who underwent elective
abdominal surgery [2], shown in Figure 1. The overall multiscale model
captures decreased insulin signaling as a result of increased IL-6 levels
and the subsequent hyperglycemia that may ensue.

Conclusion A multiscale model has been developed to describe the

on the macroscale, which could then be used to characterize insulin
sensitivity and to provide insulin treatment advice to reduce glucose
variability.

Impact of a real-time electronic persistent hyperglycemia alert on
glucose control in the ICU

Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P455 (doi: 10.1186/cc12393)

Introduction Hyperglycemia is frequently encountered in critically
ill patients, and associated with adverse outcome. Improvement of
glucose protocol adherence may be accomplished using electronic
alerts. We configured a non-intrusive real-time electronic alert, called a
GLYC sniffer, as part of our Intensive Care Information System (ICIS) that
continuously evaluates the occurrence of persistent hyperglycemia
and hypoglycemia. The GLYC sniffer is configured in such a way to
give an alert: if two consecutive glucose values are >150 mg/dl, with
a minimum interval of 60 minutes; or if a glucose value is <80 mg/dl.
We wanted to evaluate whether the GLYC sniffer would improve the
glucose control.

Methods A single-center, prospective intervention study during a
6-month period in our 22-bed surgical ICU. Two study phases were
compared: a 3-month pre-alert phase with no alerting to the nurses,
and a 3-month intervention phase where the GLYC sniffer was alerting
through the Clinical Notification System of our ICIS.

Results A total of 652 different patients having a total of 699 admission
episodes was recorded during the study period. There were no
significant differences between the two study groups regarding
baseline demographic data, first glucose value upon admission. A
total of 2,335 GLYC sniffer alerts were recorded during the whole study
period: 84.3% persistent hyperglycemia alerts (1,021 in the pre-alert
group, 948 in the alert group), and 15.7% hypoglycemia alerts (139
vs. 227). A significantly lower percentage of glucose values in the alert
group were hyperglycemic (19.5% vs. 26.5%, P <0.001). The proportion
of persistent hyperglycemic values (i.e. consecutive glucose values
exceeding the limit of 150 mg/dl) was significantly lower in the alert

S169

group (9.9% vs. 15.4%, P <0.001). The patients in the alert group spend
significantly more time within the set target glucose interval of 80 to
150 mg/dl (82.3% vs. 75.0%, P = 0.009). A significantly lower proportion
of patients experienced a new-onset hypoglycemic event (<80 mg/dl)
in the alert group (19.3% vs. 26.2%, P = 0.04).

Conclusion A real-time electronic persistent glycemia sniffer resulted
in a significantly higher proportion of normoglycemia, without
increasing the variability. Furthermore, hypoglycemic events occurred
less frequently, and were resolved more timely. Smart alerting is able to
improve quality of care, while diminishing the problem of alert fatigue.

Individualized targeted glucose control to avoid hypoglycemia

Introduction Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia have been linked to
worse outcomes in critically ill patients. While there is controversy as
to the optimal tightness of glucose control in critically ill patients, there
is agreement that an upper limit to safe glucose levels exists and that
avoiding hypoglycemic episodes should be prioritized. Our algorithm
can assist clinicians in maintaining blood glucose ([Gbl]) within a
desired target range while avoiding hypoglycemia.

Methods Our model predictive control (MPC) algorithm uses insulin
and glucose as control inputs and a linearized model of glucose-
insulin-fatty acid interactions. To allow the controller model to learn
from data, a moving horizon estimation (MHE) technique tailored
the tissue sensitivity to insulin to individual responses. Patient data
([Gbl] measurements, insulin and nutritional infusion rates) were from
the HIDENIC database at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
[Gbl] measurements, typically hourly, were interpolated to impute
a measurement every 5 minutes. The model captured patient [Gbl]
via nonlinear least squares by adjusting insulin sensitivity (SI) and
endogenous glucose production (EGPO). The resulting virtual patient
(VP) is used to evaluate the performance of the MPC—MHE algorithm.
Results MPC controller performance on one VP is shown in Figure 1.
Across a population of 10 VPs, the average [Gbl] under MPC is
6.31 mmol/l, the average minimum is 4.62 mmol/l, the population
individual minimum is 3.49 mmol/I and the average absolute average
residual error is 0.83 mmol/l from a 5.6 mmol/I target. With standard
intervention, the 10 VPs have an average [Gbl] of 9.32 mmol/l, an
average minimum [Gbl] of 3.77 mmol/l, and a population minimum
[Gbl] of 2.78 mmol/I. Algorithm performance deteriorates significantly
if the imputed sampling time exceeds 30 minutes, underlining
the importance of dynamic variations in insulin sensitivity in this
population.

Conclusion The MPC-MHE algorithm achieves targeted glucose
control in response to changing patient dynamics and multiple
measured disturbances for a pilot population of 10 VPs. Furthermore,
the MHE scheme updates patient parameters in real time in response
to changing patient dynamics.

admission. Diagnosis of diabetes within 6 months from the index
admission was presumed as revealing DM at inclusion, which excluded
the patient. Patients who were taking glucocorticoids during the follow-
up period were excluded. The rest of the patients, if consented, were
assessed for their diabetic status with a single HbA1c measurement.
Results A total of 2,696 patients were included in the study: 1,441
medical and 1,255 surgical, hyperglycaemia (=7.8 mmol/l) was
registered in 1,419 (52%). During the 5 years from index admission 409
died and 38 were taking glucocorticoids, and 10 refused participation.
Diabetes was diagnosed in 189 patients during the 6 months after index
admission. The remaining cohort of 2,320 patients had 1,169 patients
who were hyperglycaemic during hospitalisation. Diabetes was already
diagnosed in 132 patients, of whom 112 were hyperglycaemic in the
ICU; prediabetes was already diagnosed in 121 patients, of whom
83 had ICU hyperglycaemia. Since 125 patients (55 hyperglycaemic)
refused HbA1c testing, it was performed on 1,852 patients and revealed
diabetes in 136 patients (107 had hyperglycaemia) and prediabetes
in 103 patients (75 were hyperglycaemic in ICU). Overall, patients
who had hyperglycaemia had 19.8% cumulative 5-year incidence of
diabetes and 14.3% of prediabetes. Nonhyperglycaemic ICU patients
had cumulative incidences of 4.5% and 6.6%, respectively. Relative risk
for developing diabetes during 5 years after ICU admission is 4.2 (95%
Cl = 3.2 to 5.9) for patients who did have hyperglycaemia.
Conclusion The results of this study confirm in a large mixed medical/
surgical ICU population that hyperglycaemia occurring in severe
illness or the perioperative period is associated with increased risk
of developing diabetes. Suggesting lifestyle changes to reduce the
risk and regular follow-up should be implemented at least for these
patients.

Introduction The objective of the study was to determine the
association between average glucose level (AVG) and _ hospital
outcomes in critically ill patients.

Methods We performed a chart review of the MIMICII and HIDENIC
databases, prospective cohorts of over 32,000 and 46,000 patients
admitted to the ICUs at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between
2001 and 2007 and the ICUs at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
between 1991 and 2008, respectively. All admissions of patients
>18 years without the diagnosis of DKA and NKHS were included.
Diabetics were identified from ICD-9 documentation. Propensity score
for death (pDead) was computed from either SAP1 (MIMICII) or APACHE
Ill (HIDENIC) to assess the risk of death. Hypoglycemia was defined as
AVG <60 mg/dl. AVG was computed as the area under the glucose
curve throughout ICU admission. Mortality was examined within
bins (each bin is categorized by a 10 mg/dl increase in AVG) and was
compared between adjacent categories using a chi-square test. The
same method was repeated among diabetics, nondiabetics, patients
with lower (pDead greater than median) and higher (pDead lower than

median) risk of death. Statistical significance was noted following a
Bonferroni correction.

Results MIMICII database: 21,209 admissions met inclusion criteria.
Mean age: 62.5 + 16.4 years; female: 9,070 (42.8%); diabetes: 5,496
(25.9%); mean admission SAP1 score: 13.8 + 5.2; mean LOS: 9 days (IQR
6.15); hospital mortality: 10.3%. HIDENIC database: 38,872 admissions
met inclusion criteria. Mean age: 59.4 + 17.3 years; female: 16,675
(42.9%); diabetes: 11,326 (29.1%); mean admission APACHE III score:
80.2 + 14; mean LOS: 11 days (IQR 7.22); hospital mortality: 14.3%. In
both databases, association between average glucose and hospital
mortality followed a bathtub shape with mortality nadir between
80 and 130 mg/dl. No mortality difference was observed between
adjacent AVG glucose bins in the bottom of the bathtub (Figure 1).
This relationship was preserved in nondiabetics, and for patients with
higher risk of death.

Conclusion Low and high average glucose are associated with
mortality.

Introduction We evaluated the clinical and numerical accuracy of the
Freestyle Navigator continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system, in
critically ill adults using two different methods of calibration. Studies
looking at intensive glucose control have yielded conflicting results
with increased rates of iatrogenic hypoglycemia. Availability of accurate
real-time glucose information may improve safety and efficacy of
glucose control in the critical care unit.

Methods In a randomized prospective trial, paired CGM and reference
glucose (hourly arterial blood gas (ABG)) were collected from 24 adults
with critical illness (age 60 + 14 years, BMI 29.6 + 9.3 kg/m’, APACHE
score range 6 to 19) and hyperglycemia (glucose =>10 mmol/l or treated
with intravenous insulin), over 48 hours. In 12 subjects, CGM was force-
calibrated at variable 1 to 6 hourly intervals using ABG glucose (FC
arm). In the other 12 subjects, the sensor was calibrated according to
the manufacturer's instructions (1, 2, 10, 24 hours after insertion) using
arterial blood and built-in glucometer (MC arm).

Results Two groups had similar characteristics at baseline. A total of
1,060 CGM/ABG pairs were analyzed and reference glucose ranged
from 4.3 to 18.8 mmol/l. Median (IQR) absolute relative deviation was
lower in the FC arm (7.0% (3.5, 13.0) vs. 12.8% (6.3, 21.8), FC vs. MC,
P <0.001). Similarly, the percentage of points in the Clarke error grid
zone A points meeting ISO criteria were higher with FC (87.8% vs.
70.2%). Sensor bias (median (IQR)) was significantly lower in the FC
arm (-0.1 (-0.7, 0.4) mmol/l vs. -1.1 (—2.3, -0.1) mmol/l, P <0.001). The
median (IQR) interval between calibrations in FC arm was 169 (122,
213) minutes.

Conclusion CGM accuracy in the MC arm was comparable with accuracy
in subjects with type 1 diabetes. Further significant improvements to
CGM accuracy in critical care are possible by increasing the frequency
of calibrations. Such accurate CGM may provide valuable information
to guide insulin therapy in critically ill subjects.

Introduction Hypoglycemia (H) is a complication of intensive insulin
(IN) therapy of critically ill patients and is independently associated

S171

with increased risk of mortality (M). Heightened attention to identified
risk factors (RF) and causes of hypoglycemic events (HE) may lead to
improvement in glycemic control. A limited literature describes RF for
H but a detailed root cause analysis (RCA) of individual HE has not been
published.

Methods This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data
including 835 patients admitted consecutively between 1 February
2012 and 31 October 2012 to the 16-bed medical-surgical ICU of a
university-afflliated teaching hospital. The blood glucose (BG, mg/dl)
target was 90 to 120 and the monitoring frequency was every 3 hours,
or every 1 hour when the patient received i.v. IN infusion. HE data were
collected by the bedside nurse, using a cutoff of BG <60, and information
was abstracted from the unit’s database. RF included: shock (SH), renal
insufficiency (RI), hepatic failure (HF), mechanical ventilation (MV), and
diabetes mellitus (DM). Attributable causes included: IN treatment,
improper monitoring frequency (MF), interruption of feeding (FE),
and spontaneous (SP). We measured rates of severe (<40) and mild (40
to 69) H, and compared them as well as percentage of values in the
optimum range (70 to 139) and hyperglycemic range (>139) with data
from the preceding 3 months (PRE).

Results Sixty-three (7.5%) patients sustained a total of 79 HE. They were
older, more likely to be diabetic, and had higher APACHE IV predicted

P <0.0001, P <0.0001). BG 70 to 139 increased 5.5% (P <0.0001). In
total, 4.2% and 22.4% of PRE patients sustained severe and mild H.
In total, 0.7% and 14.1% of RCA patients sustained severe and mild H
(P = 0.0029, P = 0.0003).

Conclusion IN treatment was associated with barely more than
one-half of HE in this population of intensively monitored patients.
Implementation of an initiative mandating RCA of every HE, including
identification of RF and attributable causes, was associated with a
significant improvement in glycemic control.

Introduction Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in ICUs has the
potential to improve patient safety outcomes. The GluCath Intravascular
CGM System uses a novel quenched chemical fluorescence sensing
mechanism to measure glucose concentration in venous or arterial
blood (BG). This is the first report of this system deployed for 48 hours
in both arteries and veins of ICU patients.

Methods This ongoing clinical study evaluates up to two sensors per
subject in 20 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. An arterial sensor is
deployed via a standard 20 G radial artery catheter inserted for routine
care and an optional venous sensor is deployed percutaneously in an
upper arm vein. Data are presented from the first five patients. Outcome
measures are qualitative (ease of use, workflow fit) and quantitative
(accuracy vs. reference analyzer). Sensors were inserted shortly after
ICU admission, with ultrasound guidance for venous sensor insertion.
In vivo calibration was performed at 1 and 2 hours, then each morning.
Glucose values were recorded every 10 seconds by the system. Hourly
arterial reference samples were analyzed via Radiometer ABL 800 Flex
Blood Gas Analyzer (BGA).

Results Arterial sensors were successfully deployed in all five patients
and did not interfere with clinical care, blood pressure monitoring
or sampling. One arterial catheter failed resulting in sensor removal
at 36 hours. The venous sensor was deployed in three patients, but
removed from two patients due to thrombosis identified during
surveillance ultrasound examinations. A total of 202 reference BG
samples ranging from 5.3 to 11.3 mmol/I were collected. Precision
between arterial and venous sensors (n = 2) was 9.3% CV. Arterial
sensor accuracy compared with BGA was 5.5% MARD. One hundred

Introduction Blood glucose (BG) control reduces morbidity and length
of stay, and is standard practice in patients undergoing cardiac surgery
[1]. However, maintaining BG in the target range, while avoiding
hypoglycemia, is challenging. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
is a promising technology that may help address these challenges.
We investigated the performance and safety of Medtronic Sentrino®, a
newly developed CGM for critically ill adults, in the cardiac ICU.
Methods Adult patients with actual or planned cardiac ICU admission
at a single tertiary center were approached for participation and
signed consent. Other inclusion criteria were treatment with i.v. insulin
(target BG <140 mg/dl) and life expectancy >96 hours. After initiation
of i.v. insulin, Sentrino® subcutaneous glucose sensors were inserted
into patients’ anterior thighs with planned study participation of 72
to 96 hours. Reference BG was collected according to ICU protocol,
obtained from central venous catheter and analyzed with bedside
blood gas analyzer (BGA; i-STAT®, Abbott, USA). Sensor glucose
(SG) results were displayed, and its predictive alerts and alarms fully
enabled. Additional reference BGs were obtained during alarms and
calibration. All treatment decisions were based on BGA data, not on SG
values.

Results A total of 21 patients were enrolled; all successfully completed
the study. Mean age was 65 years, 38% were women, 67% had diabetes.
Types of surgery were CABG (38%), valve replacement (29%), combined
CABG and valve (19%) and cardiac transplant (14%). SG was displayed
95% of the time during the study, and 864 paired BG-SG points were
used for analysis. Overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD)

was 12.2%. No differences in CGM system accuracy were seen within
subgroups of low versus high Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)
score (MARD 12.1% and 10.6% for STS >8% vs. <8%, respectively)
or hemodynamic status (MARD 12.0% and 12.4% for compromised
vs. stable hemodynamics). Consensus grid analysis showed >99%
of SG values within A/B zones, and 0% in D/E zones. No device or
study-related adverse events were reported. In total, 80% and 100%
of clinicians found Sentrino® easy to use after one and two patients,
respectively.

Conclusion The Sentrino® CGM system demonstrated good analytic
and clinically relevant accuracy, excellent reliability and safety in
critically ill cardiac patients; and was easy to use and integrate in the
cardiac ICU. Future studies are needed to determine whether CGM can
improve BG control and reduce hypoglycemia in this patient group.

Intensive insulin therapy in critically ill children: impact on blood
glucose dynamics and its relation with mortality

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P463 (doi: 10.1186/cc12401)

Introduction A large RCT showed that tight glucose control (TGC),
targeting age-adjusted normal fasting blood glucose levels with insulin
infusion, decreased morbidity and mortality in critically children [1].
However, the incidence of hypoglycemia increased substantially in the
TGC group. We aimed to assess the effect of TGC on the three domains
of blood glucose dynamics (hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and blood
glucose variability) and their independent association with mortality
in the pediatric ICU.

Methods This is a preplanned substudy of a published RCT in one
10-bed pediatric ICU. Seven hundred patients (age 1 to 16 years),
admitted to the PICU between October 2004 and December 2007, were
randomized to either TGC (50 to 80 mg/dl in infants, 70 to 100 mg/dl in
children) or to the usual care tolerating hyperglycemia up to 215 mg/
dl (UC). Patients with at least two arterial blood glucose measurements
were included (UC n = 349; TGC n = 348).

Results Mean blood glucose levels were lowered from 143 + 34 mg/dl
in the UC group to 104 + 24 mg/dl (P <0.0001). The median number
of samples per patient did not differ between UC (21 (13 to 48)) and
TGC (22 (15 to 49)). TGC lowered the hyperglycemic index, a marker of

----$$$$----$$$$----

hyperglycemia over time, from median 44 (IQR 29 to 66) mg/dl in UC to
12 (7 to 23) mg/dl, as well as the glycemic penalty index, an aggregate
measure of dysglycemia, from median 44 (32 to 58) in UC to 22 (16
to 30) (both P <0.0001). Despite frequent hypoglycemia <40 mg/dl
(1.4% in UC, 25.0% in TGC, P <0.0001), TGC did not result in increased
blood glucose variability, as reflected by the standard deviation of
the blood glucose time series (TGC: 36 (24 to 50) mg/dl, UC 34 (26
to 48) mg/dl, P = 0.82). In multivariable logistic regression analysis,
adjusting for baseline risk factors (age, severity of illness, malignancy,
type of admission), hypoglycemia (OR = 1.6, 95% Cl = 0.19 to 2.22) and
blood glucose variability (OR = 1.0, 95% Cl = 0.97 to 1.02, per mg/dl)
were not associated with PICU mortality. In contrast, hyperglycemic
index (OR = 1.02, 95% Cl = 1.01 to 1.04, per mg/dl) was independently
associated with mortality and its lowering statistically explained the
outcome benefit of the intervention.

Conclusion TGC substantially reduced the hyperglycemic index, at the
expense of increased hypoglycemia incidence, but without affecting
blood glucose variability. Statistical analysis suggested strictly avoiding
hyperglycemia in order to bring about outcome benefit with insulin in
critically ill children.

Implementation of evidence-based protocols improves survival:
a 15-year surgical ICU experience in 10,172 patients

SA Nasraway

Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P464 (doi: 10.1186/cc12402)

Introduction There has been enormous interest in measuring
ICU performance in terms of mortality and resource use, owing to
increased public and health insurer scrutiny. We elected to describe the
performance of our surgical ICU, using a standardized mortality ratio
(SMR = observed / predicted mortality).

Methods The primary cohort was all patients admitted to the surgical
ICU from March 2010 through February 2012 and related outcomes.
The change in SMR was longitudinally determined from the latest 15-
year study period (1997 to 2011) comprised of 10,172 patients.

Results There were 1,799 ICU admissions in the primary cohort. Hospital
mortality, observed and predicted by APACHE IV, was measured. Crude
hospital mortality was 8.4%. The hospital SMR (observed / predicted
mortality) was 0.58 (95% Cl: 0.49 to 0.65). The SMR decreased by 20%
from 0.73 to 0.58 over the 15-year study period, an absolute 1% per year
decrease (P = 0.039; 95% Cl: -0.02 to -0.002), as shown in Figure 1.
Conclusion Mortality was less than predicted and steadily declined
during the previous 15 years. The SMR can be used to track success
when new quality measures are introduced or changes in the delivery
of care are made. ICUs should report their standardized mortality ratios
to evaluate performance.

Decubitus ulcers are associated with prolonged length of stay in
critically ill patients

Longmeadow, MA, USA

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P465 (doi: 10.1186/cc12403)

Introduction How decubitus ulcers (DU) diagnosed on admission
to the ICU affect resource use is unknown. We hypothesize that this
easily identifiable clinical finding would be associated with longer
hospitalizations.

Methods Clinical assessment was used to identify patients with DU on
admission to the ICU. The association of DU on hospital and ICU length
of stay (LOS) was assessed with generalized linear models that adjusted
for ICU admission source, age, APACHE IV score, diabetes, sepsis,
hepatic failure, dialysis and mechanical ventilation.

Results DU was present on admission in 180 of 2,723 (6.6%) during a
19-month period in 2011 to 2012 at a single teaching hospital in New
England. Patients with decubiti were sicker on admission (mean (SD)
APACHE IV 80.2 (28.2) vs. 58.7 (30.7), P <0.001), more likely to be age 65
or older (58.9% vs. 41.8%, P <0.001) and require more organ supportive
therapies (Table 1). DU patients had a higher in-hospital mortality rate
(32.2% vs. 18.3%, P <0.001) and longer mean ICU and hospital LOS
(4.9 vs. 3.3 days and 15.6 vs. 10.5 days, respectively (P <0.001)). After
multivariate adjustment, DU patients stayed 3.2 days, 95% Cl (1.6,
4.8) longer in the hospital than non-DU patients and stayed 2.5 days
longer, 95% Cl (0.7, 0.43) among survivors. DU patients had longer ICU
stays (1.3 days, 95% Cl (0.3, 1.3)) in general but were statistically similar
among survivors.

HIV patients admitted to an ICU of a university hospital -
experience of 15 years: 1995 to 2009

Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P466 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12404)

Introduction HIV infection is a major public health problem in the
world. The use of prophylaxis against opportunist infection and
the introduction of HAART in 1996 increased life expectancies. The
therapeutic use of ICU resources for HIV patients has been controversial,
questioning the admission of these patients especially in advanced
stages of the disease, given the poor prognosis. The aim of this study
was to determine the experience of the past 15 years in relation to the
income of these patients in an ICU.

Methods A retrospective case series consisting of patients with
diagnosis of HIV infection (known or unknown) admitted between
January 1995 and December 2009. We collected demographic and
epidemiological data, process of acquisition of the disease, infection
status: known or unknown patient infected, whether or not receiving
antiretroviral therapy and whether it was effective (undetectable viral
load at the time of admission), APACHE II, cause of admission, need
for mechanical ventilation (MV), pathology related or unrelated to HIV
infection and ICU mortality.

Results During this period 12,607 patients were admitted to the
ICU, 188 (1.5%) HIV-positive. Mean APACHE II score 17.6, median age
39 years, 73% men and 90% Spanish nationality. Principal risk behavior:
addiction drugs injection (67%). Seventeen percent of patients did
not know who was infected with HIV at the time of admission to the
ICU. Fifty-three percent were not receiving HAART. Of the 88 patients
treated, 93% were receiving HAART (effective in 88% of cases). Sixty
percent of the patients came from the emergency department of the
hospital. Main admission diagnoses: acute respiratory failure caused
by infection (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pneumocystis jirovecii),
neurological disorders (coma for illicit drugs and psychotropic) and
septic shock. Seventy percent required MV. Of patients whose HIV
infection was not known, 93.5% were admitted for related pathology.
In patients of known infection, the pathology associated with HIV was
30%. Average length of stay 9 was days. ICU mortality was 35%. Most
frequent causes of death: septic shock and multiple organ failure.
Conclusion Depending on the patient and the cause of admission,
ICU admission may represent an excellent opportunity as a screening
method to determine HIV status. Given the greater efficacy of HAART
at present, most patients with medical or surgical conditions unrelated
to HIV infection will be eligible to join the ICU. People with HIV can and
should benefit from using reasonable and individualized care in an ICU.

Introduction The aim was to analyze the prognosis of AIDS patients
with organ dysfunctions at ICU admission.

Methods A prospective cohort study, including all patients with HIV/
AIDS diagnosis, who were admitted to a specialized ICU from November
2009 until May 2012. Patients with less than 24 hours of ICU stay were
excluded. Demographics and nutritional status were collected. The
organ dysfunctions were classified according to the SOFA score, and
categorized as absent (0 SOFA point), mild (1 to 2 points) and severe (3 to
4 points). We expressed numeric variables as median and interquartile
interval (25% to 75%). We performed a multivariate analysis of possible
variables associated with hospital mortality (P <0.2), and we explored
the 7-day, 28-day and 60-day survival of patients with and without
independent risk factors.

S174

Results We included 139 patients with HIV/AIDS admitted to the
ICU. Median age was 40 (31 to 48) years and 71% were male. Severe
malnutrition was common (34%). The CD4 cell count was 84 (25 to 274)
cells/mm? and viral load was 17,733 (67 to 174,214) copies/ml; 57% had
at least one opportunistic infection; 55% had used antiretroviral therapy
previous to ICU admission. Mechanical ventilation was used by 46% of
patients and hospital mortality was 42%. Total SOFA score was 5 (2 to
9) points. Cardiovascular dysfunction was the most common on the
first day of stay (51%), followed by respiratory (42%), neurological (40%),
renal (35%), hematological (27%) and hepatic (17%). Cardiovascular and
renal dysfunctions presented with higher rate of severe dysfunction
(30% and 15%, respectively). Rates of neurological (P = 0.002), renal
(P = 0.009) and hematological (P = 0.003) dysfunctions were higher
in nonsurvivors. Age, CD4 cell count, malnutrition, and opportunistic
infections were included in the multivariate analysis. Neurological
dysfunction was the independent risk factor for hospital mortality
(odds 3.2 (1.4 to 7.2)). The presence of neurological dysfunction was
dichotomized: associated or not with primary neurological diagnosis;
survival was lower in the patients with neurological dysfunction and
without primary neurological diagnosis (log-rank test 0.001 in the
7-day and 0.02 in the 28-day analysis). Sixty-day survival was similar
in primary and secondary neurological dysfunction, but it remained
lower than in patients without neurological impairment.

Conclusion Neurological dysfunction was independently associated
with hospital survival, mainly in those AIDS critically patients without
primary neuropathy.

Introduction Sepsis in HIV patients carries a high mortality. Our
purpose is to identify mortality predictors in this population.

Methods A retrospective study of HIV patients admitted to our
ICU between January 2005 and December 2009. We identify septic
patients and analyzed demographic factors, etiology, organ failure
and outcome. We used logistic regression to calculate the relative
mortality risk for each qualitative variable and the beta (8) coefficient
for quantitative variables.

Results Sixty-two septic patients were admitted to our ICU during
the study period (71% men, mean age: 40.59 + 8.12). A total of
56.5% came from the ED, mean hospital stay before ICU admission:
6.14 + 10.96 days. A total of 66.1% had a history of intravenous drug
use, other comorbidities: COPD (9.7%), cirrhosis (8.1%), solid or
hematologic malignancy (12.9%). A total of 40.3% were under HAART.
Mean CD4 count at admission: 219.62 + 353.93 cells/mm?. Mean viral
load: 4.57 + 3.25 log. Mean albumin levels: 2.3 + 0.53 g/dl. APACHE
Il: 21.98 + 7.97. The lung was the most frequent focus of infection
(65.6%) followed by the CNS. The most common pathogen was
S. pneumoniae (28.8%), followed by P. jirovecii (13.6%). In total, 62.9%
needed vasopressors, 79% mechanical ventilation and 19.4% renal
replacement. Mean ICU and hospital length of stay: 10.43 + 10.52 and
34.76 + 29.64 days. ICU mortality: 33.9%; hospital mortality: 41.9%. ICU
mortality increases for each day of hospital stay before ICU admission
(B = 1.062, 95% Cl = 1.009 to 1.118, P = 0.022), each point of: cardiac
frequency at admission (B = 1.059, 95% Cl = 1.024 to 1.096, P = 0.001),
FIO, (B = 1.034, 95% Cl = 1.011 to 1.057, P = 0.003), pCO, (per mmHg)
(8 = 1.052, 95% Cl = 1.007 to 1.098, P = 0.023); and decreases for each
point of: albumin (g/dl) (8 = —0.307, 95% Cl = 0.095 to 0.986, P= 0.047),
mean arterial pressure (mmHg) (8 = 0.951, 95% Cl = 0.904 to 0.999,
P = 0.048), pH (8 = 0.002, 95% Cl = 0.0 to 0.172, P = 0.006), first ICU
24-hour diuresis (ml) (B = 0.999, 95% Cl = 0.998 to 1.000, P= 0.004) and
base excess (8 = 0.912, 95% Cl = 0.836 to 0.995, P = 0.039). Mortality
increases threefold (8 = 3.134, 95% Cl = 1.051 to 9.345, P = 0.04) if
patients do not come from the ED, almost 10-fold if the patients
need vasopressors for more than 24 hours (B = 9.975, 95% Cl = 2.054
to 48.451, P = 0.004) and fivefold if patients need renal replacement
(B = 5.692, 95% Cl = 1.466 to 22.099, P= 0.012).

Conclusion Neither immune status-related variables nor comorbidity
or infection focus are mortality predictors. Poor nutritional status,
delayed ICU admission, shock or renal failure increase the ICU relative
mortality risk. Tachycardia, hypotension, hypercapnia, acidosis, and
oliguria in the first ICU 24 hours increase significantly ICU mortality.
Mechanical ventilation is not a mortality predictor.

Introduction Patients with lung cancer commonly require the ICU
for a variety of acute illnesses related to the underlying malignancy,
treatment, or comorbid conditions. ICU admission of patients with
nonresectable lung cancer has been criticized based on the high
mortality rate in this population. However, recent advances in critical
care may have changed this scenario. The aim of this study was to
identify factors associated with hospital mortality in this group of
patients.

Methods A retrospective study was conducted in consecutive medical
and surgical patients with lung cancer admitted to a university hospital
ICU in Sao Paulo, between 2007 and 2012. A univariate analysis was
performed to identify associated variables with hospital mortality.
Selected variables were included in the multivariate model.

Results From 597 patients included in the study, 477 were medical
admissions (79.8%) and 120 were surgical admissions (20.2%). Four
hundred and twenty (70%) patients had metastasis, 222 patients (37%)
required the ICU because of respiratory failure and 121 (20%) because
of septic shock. The ICU and hospital mortality rates were 53.9% and
64%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, variables associated
with hospital mortality were diagnosis of nonsmall-cell lung cancer,
higher Charlson morbidity index, medical admission, active neoplasm,
vasopressor need at admission to and at 24 hours of ICU, acute renal
failure at admission, non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation
need at admission to and at 24 hours of ICU and a higher admission
arterial lactate. By multivariate analysis, risk factors of hospital mortality
were diagnosis of nonsmall-cell lung cancer (OR = 3.32; 95% Cl, 2.08
to 5.29, P <0.001), medical admission (OR = 2.89; 95% Cl, 1.75 to 4.77,
P <0.001), acute renal failure at admission (OR = 4.09; 95% Cl, 1.49 to
11.21, P <0.001), non-invasive ventilation at 24 hours of ICU (OR = 2.50;
95% Cl, 1.48 to 4.23, P= 0.001) and mechanical ventilation at 24 hours
of ICU (OR = 3.68; 95% Cl, 1.87 to 7.26, P <0.001).

Conclusion Hospital survival in patients with lung cancer requiring
ICU admission was 36%. Our results provide evidence that ICU
management may be appropriate in patients with nonresectable lung
cancer and appoint risk factors for mortality, helping to better triage
cancer patients who will benefit from ICU care.

Introduction Because the prognosis of older patients with cancer may
be poor compared with younger patients, it remains controversial
whether they benefit from ICU treatment. The objective of this study
was to identify factors associated with hospital mortality in older
patients with cancer requiring the ICU.

S175

Methods A retrospective study was conducted in consecutive medical
and surgical older patients with cancer admitted to a university hospital
ICU in Sao Paulo, between 2007 and 2012. Univariate and multivariate
analysis were performed to identify associated and independent
factors related to hospital mortality.

Results From 8,976 patients with cancer requiring ICU at the period,
600 patients were 80 years old or higher. Most patients were male
(53%), had solid neoplasm (86%), were from medical admission (54%)
and 37% had metastatic disease. The mean age was 84 years (+ 3).
The ICU and hospital mortality rates were 30% and 44%, respectively.
In the univariate analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality
were diagnosis of lung cancer, medical admission, active neoplasm,
vasopressor need at 24 hours of ICU, acute renal failure at admission,
mechanical ventilation need at admission to and at 24 hours of ICU and
a higher admission arterial lactate. By multivariate analysis, risk factors
of hospital mortality were diagnosis of lung cancer (OR = 2.32; 95% Cl,
1.08 to 3.29, P <0.001), medical admission (OR = 6.473; 95% Cl, 2.76 to
15.15, P <0.001), acute renal failure at admission (OR = 3.09; 95% Cl, 1.49
to 9.21, P <0.001), mechanical ventilation at 24 hours of ICU (OR = 5.68;
95% Cl, 2.87 to 7.26, P<0.001) and lactate levels at admission (OR = 1.02;
95% Cl, 1.006 to 1.051, P <0.001).

Conclusion Hospital survival in older patients with cancer requiring
ICU admission is acceptable. Our results provide evidence that ICU
management may be appropriate in older patients with cancer and
appoint risk factors for mortality, helping to better triage cancer
patients who will benefit from ICU care.

Identifying risk factors for readmission to the ICU: a qualitative
approach

DG Strange, K Tjelle, A Lindhardt, K Jensen

Bispebjerg Hospital, Copenhagen NV, Denmark

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P471 (doi: 10.1186/cc12409)

Introduction Readmission to the ICU within 48 hours is an indicator of
quality of intensive care and is associated with an increase in mortality.
During the last years several groups have published data based on
multivariate logistic regression analysis to describe characteristics of
patients who needed readmission to the ICU. Older age, comorbid
conditions and severity of illness (APACHE score) have been among
the strongest predictors for readmission. In our ICU most patients are
in the groups formerly identified as risk groups, which means that
stratification and prediction of readmission is difficult. Because of the
unusual high severity of acute and pre-existing illnesses we could
not find a data match on comparable patient groups. To investigate
whether we could reduce our rate of readmission we therefore decided
to perform a qualitative investigation to identify risk factors related to
readmission. After identification of the risk factors we will take actions
to optimize care and perform ongoing control of the implemented
actions to secure that they decreases the rate of readmission.

Methods Retrospective data on patients readmitted to the ICU within
48 hours during an 8-month period (November 2011 to June 2012) were
drawn from the Critical Information System (CIS) at ICU ZIT, Bispebjerg
Hospital, Denmark. ZIT is a multidisciplinary unit with 10 beds and 500
to 600 admissions/year and a median SAPS II score of 47. A group of
consultants, junior doctors and nurses from the ICU and the ward each
read the patient files with focus on pattern recognition and suggested
trigger points to focus on. Data on trigger points were then drawn from
the CIS system and re-evaluated. Finally, five key points were identified
and serves as basis for future actions.

Results In a qualitative analysis, readmissions to the ICU are related
to the following five key points — discharge outside day hours, lack of
infection control, stay inICU <2 days, lung physiotherapy ordinated but
not effectuated, and several minor organ dysfunctions (atrial fibrillation
and acute kidney injury). Age, diagnosis, SAPS II score or ventilator
treatment during intensive care was not different in patients with
successful discharge and patients readmitted in this group of patients.
Conclusion It is possible and suitable to identify key points for future
efforts in a given subgroup of patients using a systematic qualitative
approach.

Introduction Adult recipients of living donor liver transplantation
have a wide range of postoperative medical comorbidities altering
various clinical and laboratory parameters. We aimed to assess 30-
day postoperative clinical and laboratory changes and their value in
predicting outcome of LDLT recipients.

Methods A prospective registry involving patients who underwent LDLT
in the period from October 2004 to December 2010. Postoperative 30-
day clinical and laboratory data included: clinical BP, HR, temperature, ICU
Stay, liver functions AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, TotPtn, Alb, TBil, DBil, INR, PTT, CRP,
kidney functions Crea, Na, K, blood picture Hb, Hct, TLC and Plt count.
Results Our study involved 142 recipients, 124 (87%) males and 18
(13%) females, who underwent living donor liver transplantation;
mean age was 53 + 14.8 years, ranging from 24 to 66 years; 29 cases
(20.43%) at Kasr Al Aini University Hospital and 113 cases (79.57%) at
the International Medical Center. The 30-day mortality rate was 13.38%.
Clinical and laboratory parameters showed gradual resolution towards
normal values in survivors or deterioration in nonsurvivors, allowing
one to predict mortality at various cutoff points. Clinical parameters: HR
>94 cutoff (Acc 76.8%, Sens 89.5%, Spec 62.6%, PPV 27, NPV 97) and ICU
stay >8 days (Acc 76.2%, Sens 75.3%, Spec 95.7%, PPV 95.7, NPV 35.3).
Laboratory parameters: INR >3.06 cutoff (Acc 87.5%, Sens 92.9%, Spec
78.6%, PPV 96.3, NPV 64.7), followed by PTT >53.3 (Acc 79.2%, Sens
78.6%, Spec 75%, PPV 93.6, NPV 42.9), Na >142.9 (Acc 72.9%, Sens 80%,
Spec 72.3%, PPV 26.7, NPV 96.6), TBil >15 (Acc 71.3%, Sens 95.5%, Spec
50%, PPV 92.4, NPV 63.6), ALT >379 (Acc 67.5%, Sens 72.2%, Spec 73.8%,
PPV 28.9, NPV 94.7), TProt <4.6 (Acc 63.5%, Sens 55.6%, Spec 73.3%, PPV
24.4, NPV 91.4), AST >145 (Acc 57.4%, Sens 50%, Spec 84.4%, PPV 32.1,
NPV 92), Hct <24.4 (Acc 54.2%, Sens 47.4%, Spec 81.5%, PPV 34.6, NPV
88.2), CRP >12 (Acc 51.6%, Sens 43.7%, Spec 73.3%, PPV 90.5, NPV 17.7),
GGT >22 (Acc 51.4%, Sens 83.3%, Spec 36.9%, PPV 16.3, NPV 93.7).
Conclusion Predictors of mortality were INR >3.06 (accuracy 87.5%)
followed by PTT >53.3 (79.2%), HR >94 (76.8%), ICU stay >8 days
(76.2%), Na >142.9 (72.9%), TBil >15 (71.3%), ALT >379 (67.5%), TProt
<4.6 (63.5%), AST >145 (57.4%), Hct <24.4 (54.2%), CRP >12 (Acc 51.6%)
and GGT >22 (51.4%).

laboratory values?

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P473 (doi: 10.1186/cc12411)

Introduction Even though more accurate and updated versions such
as APACHE III and IV have been developed, APACHE II has remained the
most widely used severity scoring system in the ICU [1]. In the present
study, we aimed to develop a model mainly based on the laboratory
data available upon admission to predict mortality and to compare its
performance with that of APACHE Il in a mixed ICU in Turkey.

Methods A total of 645 adult patients who were over 18 years old
and who stayed in the ICU for more than 24 hours were included in
this study. Using stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis, a
mortality prediction model was developed based on the laboratory
data, diagnostic category and age. The adjusted probability of death,
according to the diagnostic category of the APACHE II score (adj-APACHE
Il), was calculated. The ability of the laboratory model and the adj-
APACHE II model to discriminate between survivors and nonsurvivors
was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The
calibration of the laboratory model and the adj-APACHE II model was
assessed by the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.

Results The areas under the ROC curves of the laboratory models and
the adj-APACHE II scores for the prediction of mortality were 0.80 (95%
Cl: 0.76 to 0.85) and 0.78 (95% Cl: 0.74 to 0.83), respectively (P >0.05, z
statistic). The Hosmer—Lemeshow statistic had a chi-squared value of

S176

2.01 (P = 0.98) for the laboratory model and 13.2 (P = 0.10) for the adj-

APACHE II model.

Conclusion If the aim is to predict mortality as accurately as APACHE

Il, the mortality prediction model based mainly on routine admission

laboratory tests can achieve this using computer technology, without

labor-related costs, as soon as the patient is admitted to the ICU.

However, it is necessary to perform multicenter validation studies.

Introduction The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of
SAPS 3 and EuroSCORE and whether there is complementarity between
them in ICU patients admitted after cardiac surgery.

Methods An observational, prospective and multicenter study of
patients included in the ARIAM registry of adult cardiac surgery. We
analyzed clinical variables, surgery data and postoperative compli-
cations, outcomes and scores (SAPS 3 and EuroSCORE). Discrimination
was assessed using the area under the ROC curve. With the standardized
mortality ratio (SMR) we evaluated the agreement between predicted
and observed mortality. We used multiple logistic regression for
multivariate analysis.

Results A total of 5,642 patients were included, admitted to any five
hospitals, consecutively between 2008 and 2012. Mean age was
63.62 + 12.80 years. Surgery room mortality was 1.4%, ICU mortality
was 7.9% and in-hospital mortality was 11.2%. SAPS 3 was calculated
in 5,383 patients. SAPS 3 was 40.91 + 10.46, and the expected rate of
mortality was 11.09% (with the southwestern Europe equation), with
an observed hospital mortality of 9.6%, SMR = 0.87 (0.79 to 0.94). With
the general equation, the expected mortality was 10.47%, SMR = 0.917
(0.843 to 0.996). Discrimination of SAPS 3 was evaluated using the area
under the ROC curve, it was 0.77 (0.75 to 0.79). The 30-day mortality was
9.6%, with an expected 30-day mortality predicted by EuroSCORE of
7.86% (SMR = 1.22; Cl = 1.12 to 1.32). The area under the ROC curve was
0.734 for EuroSCORE (0.712 to 0.755). Multivariate analysis with logistic
regression showed complementarity between SAPS 3 and logistic
EuroSCORE (vers. I). There is a relationship between hospital mortality
and the probability of dying predicted by SAPS 3 (general equation),
OR 1.05 (1.04 to 1.06), and logistic EuroSCORE (vers. |), OR 1.024 (1.015
to 1.032). The model with both variables has a similar discrimination to
SAPS 3 alone. The area under the ROC curve of the combined model
was 0.778 (0.758 to 0.799) and 0.77 (0.75 to 0.79) using SAPS 3 only.
Conclusion There is complementarity between the SAPS 3 model and
EuroSCORE. However, a joint model with both prognosis scores has no
appreciable improvement in discrimination, compared with the SAPS
3 model. In our study, SAPS 3 shows very useful to rule out that the
superior observed mortality (compared with the mortality predicted
by EuroSCORE) is not attributable to inadequate care of patients in the
ICU, the observed mortality being even slightly below the predicted
mortality for patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the reference
hospitals in which the SAPS 3 system was developed.

Introduction It may be hypothesized that a patient's inflammatory
status might affect the clinical picture and outcome of a subsequent
septic insult. To test this hypothesis, patients were categorized
according to previous inflammatory activity and analyzed with respect
to clinical picture and outcome in a retrospective study.

Methods The Swedish ICU registry was used to identify all adult
patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in a single
Swedish ICU during 2006 to 2011. The charts were reviewed and
patients categorized into four groups based on whether the patient
had suffered systemic inflammatory-inducing insults previous to the
septic episode. The patients were categorized as: (A) primary sepsis,
no recent (<30 days) trauma/infection, ongoing systemic inflammatory
or immunosuppressive disease or malnutrition; (B) secondary sepsis,
recent (<7 days) trauma/infection or systemic inflammatory disease,
but no immunosuppressive disease or malnutrition; (C) tertiary
sepsis, >1 fulfilled criteria of secondary sepsis during the last 10 days
or immunosuppressive disease or malnutrition; and (D) patients not
attributable to A to C. After the categorization, physiological and
laboratory parameters during the ICU stay as well as therapy and
outcome were extracted from the charts. Only significant differences
(P <0.05) are presented; Mann-Whitney and chi-squared tests were
used.

Results A total of 273 charts were reviewed. In total, 242 were
categorized into A (n = 126), B (n= 79) or C (n=37). D (n=31) consisted
mainly of patients with hematological malignancies (n = 12) and
patients with chemotherapy or immunosuppressive treatment
(n = 14). The groups differed in length of stay with A< B< C. During the
first 3 days the SOFA score was higher in A compared with C and in
B compared with C. The duration of antibiotic therapy was longer in
both B and C compared with A. There were no differences in 28-day
mortality (A: 34/126 = 27%, B: 30/79 = 38%, C: 15/37 = 40%); however,
the proportions of patients dying between days 8 and 28 were higher
in B (14/63 = 22%) and C (7/29 = 24%) compared with A (5/95 = 5%).
Conclusion In this retrospective material it was possible to categorize
88.6% of all patients as having primary, secondary or tertiary sepsis.
The categories differed in clinical picture at presentation as well as in
outcome. A prospective study is warranted to validate the results of this
study.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P476 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12414)

Introduction We aimed to assess the survival of older patients after
admission to critical care compared with the population in general.
Methods We reviewed admission data for a 12-bed critical care
unit in a district general hospital in the UK between 2001 and 2010.
We calculated critical care and hospital discharge survival rates and
studied the trend in these through the decade. We searched hospital
records to establish whether these patients were still alive at November
2012 to determine life-expectancy (minimum 22-month follow-up on
all patients). This was compared with UK Office of National Statistics
data for the local population [1]. Discharge destination (care facility or
home address) was recorded as a surrogate marker of change in quality
of life post discharge.

Results A total of 481 patients aged 80 or over were admitted between
1 January 2001 and 31 December 2010, representing 9.6% of the
admissions during this time with minimal annual change. Admission
age ranged from 80 to 96 years (median 83) with a median APACHE II
score of 20 (6 to 48, IQR 16 to 25). In total, 318 (66.1%) survived to critical
care discharge and 256 (53.2%) survived to hospital discharge; 228
(89.0%) went home rather than to a care facility. Those under 80 years
demonstrated 80.6% critical care survival, 65.5% hospital survival and a
median APACHE II score of 17 (0 to 51, IQR 13 to 23). Eighty patients died
within the 22-month follow-up period with an average life expectancy
of 7.4 months. None reached life expectancy (average curtailment of
5.6 years compared with age-matched and sex-matched population
statistics). Neither of these figures changed significantly through the

S177

decade. However, 10-year follow-up on 2001/2002 admissions showed
that, despite this early mortality effect, the average post-discharge
lifespan was 5.1 years with 2.2 years shortfall in life expectancy.
Conclusion Older people represent a growing proportion of the
population although their representation in the critical care population
remained constant in this 10-year study. These patients had a slightly
higher median APACHE II score and 14.5% greater critical care mortality
than the younger patients. The majority of survivors were able to
go home; however, 31% died within 22 months with significant life
expectancy curtailment, surviving on average only 7.4 months after
discharge; this has not changed in the last 10 years. Those who survived
this initial period (69%) had a much better outlook. This information
may be vital to patients and physicians when discussing admission to
critical care.

Eldicus scores for admission to our ICU: a retrospective study

G Zani, B Gemelli, S Vitali, C Villani, R Ragazzi, S Soadaro, CA Volta, R Alvisi
University of Ferrara, Italy

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P477 (doi: 10.1186/cc12415)

Introduction The indication for ICU admission is poorly defined and
identifying patients who may benefit from it is extremely difficult. As
reported in literature, the Eldicus scores require further validation in
centers in different countries and with different patient populations [1].
Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with intermediate
severities of illness are those that benefit from ICU treatment; instead,
patients who are too well or too sick should not be admitted. There are
many unmeasurable factors that influence the triage decision and can
influence the subsequent outcome. The Eldicus scores could be the first
triage decision rule. The aim of this study was to confirm the ability of
the Eldicus scores to discriminate the survival status in our general ICU.
Methods We retrospectively enrolled all patients >18 years admitted to
the Ferrara ICU from January to June 2012. Patients’ data were recorded
using Prosafe international data collection software and consulting
the individual medical records. Data were chosen based on variables
used in the Eldicus scores. As indicated in the Eldicus algorithm, for
each patient the initial refusal score was calculated, to evaluate the
too severe patients. Then we counted the final triage score, to discover
whether some patients were too healthy to be admitted to the ICU.
Correlation between the severity of the scores and patients’ outcome
was estimated using the Wilcoxon's rank-sum test.

Results Ninety-eight patients were finally enrolled. Data are presented
as median + SD. The SAPS II score was 33 + 13 and was similar to those
reported in the literature [1]. The Karnofsky performance status scale
was 69 + 20. The Eldicus initial score was 56 + 30. The final score was
70 + 48. Seventy-eight percent of the analyzed patients were alive at
hospital discharge. A significant correlation between the severity scores
and in-hospital outcome was found (P <0.001). Limitations of our study
were the low sample size and the fact that patients not admitted to the
ICU were not considered.

Conclusion The Eldicus scores appear to be useful in identifying
patients that may benefit more from ICU admission. Further studies
should confirm the ability of these scores in helping identify those
patients who really benefit from ICU admission.

Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2
http://ccforum.com/supplements/17/S2

Methods Potential risk factors for psychological problems were
prospectively collected at ICU discharge. Two months after ICU
discharge 252 ICU survivors received the questionnaires Post-
Traumatic Stress Symptom scale-10 (PTSS-10) and Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale (HADS) to estimate the degree of post-traumatic
stress, anxiety and depression.

Results Of the 150 responders, 31% had adverse psychological
outcome, defined as PTSS-10 >35 and/or HADS subscales >8. After
analysis, six predictors with weighted risk scores were included in the
screening instrument: major pre-existing disease, being a parent to
children younger than 18 years of age, previous psychological problems,
in-ICU agitation, being unemployed or sick-listed at ICU admission and
appearing depressed in the ICU. Each predictor corresponded to a
given risk score. The total risk score, the sum of individual risk scores,
was related to the probability for adverse psychological outcome in the
individual patient. The predictive accuracy of the screening instrument,
as assessed with area under the receiver operating curve, was 0.77.
When categorizing patients in three risk probability groups — low (0 to
29%), moderate (30 to 59%) and high (60 to 100%) risk — the actual
prevalence of adverse psychological outcome in respective groups was
12%, 50% and 63%.

Conclusion The preliminary screening instrument may aid ICU clinicians
in identifying patients at risk for adverse psychological outcome after
critical illness. Prior to wider clinical use, external validation is needed.

Introduction The multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is a
dynamic process involving simultaneously or consecutively two
or more organ systems [1]. The organ dysfunction’s degree can be
assessed by three severity scores (SOFA [2], MODS [3], LODS [4]), but
they have some limitations: they do not allow the evaluation of the
clinical course of a patient, they are not reliable in populations different
from the reference one, and they do not support clinicians’ decisions.
Because MODS implies a systemic inflammatory reaction leading to
microcirculatory dysfunction, our hypothesis was that organ failures
follow a predictable sequence of appearance. Our aims were to verify
the presence of more likely organ failure sequences and to assess an
online method to predict the evolution of MODS in a patient. The high
mortality and morbidity rate of MODS in ICUs can in fact be reduced
only by a prompt and well-timed treatment [5].
Methods We selected 73 patients consecutively admitted to the ICU of
Sant'Andrea Hospital from January to June 2012. The inclusion criteria
were at least two organ systems with SOFA =2, ICU length of stay
>48 hours. For each patient we calculated the SOFA since the beginning
of the inclusion criteria and daily for 8 days. For the statistical analysis
we used Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) [6]. DBNs were applied to
model SOFA changes in order to identify the most probable sequences
of organs failures in a patient who experienced a first known failure.
Results We created a DBN for the analysis of MODS studying the
relations between organ failures at different times. The DBN was made
so that each organ failure is dependent on the previous one. We also
considered a corrective factor to take account that not all patients
completed the observation. Using software (GeNie) we obtained the
probabilities of the organ failure sequences.
Conclusion The use of DBNs, although with our limited set of data,
allowed us to identify the most likely organ dysfunction sequences
associated with a first known one. Capability to predict these sequences
in a patient makes DBNs a promising prognostic tool for physicians in
order to treat patients in a timely manner, or to test a treatment efficacy.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P480 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12418)

Introduction The aim of this study was to compare the IGS 2 score with
a predictive model built using clinical characteristics and biomarkers
associated with 1-year mortality from procalcitonin, C-reactive protein,
troponin | (TnI) and NT-Pro-BNP.

Methods We conducted a prospective observational cohort study
in a polyvalent ICU. We calculated the IGS 2 severity score in the first
24 hours. We dosed NT-Pro-BNP, Tnl, procalcitonin and C-reactive
protein at admission to the ICU. To test the biomarker model, the patient
database was divided into training (70%) and test (30%) databases. A
neural network model was trained from variables associated with
1-year mortality. All statistics were done using R v.2.15.1. We used the
pROC package to plot and compare ROC curves.

Results Lower age, NT-Pro-BNP and Tnl were significantly associated
with 1-year survival. We built a neural network model using the training
database. We used the test database to compare our model with the
IGS 2 score. The difference between the AUC of the biomarker score
and the IGS 2 score was statistically significant (Figure 1).

Conclusion Our new neural network model built using age, NT-PRO-
BNP and Tnl succeeded the internal-validation processes and predicts
1-year mortality better than IGS 2.

Introduction Assessing whether a critically ill patient should be
admitted to an ICU remains difficult and mortality amongst ICU
patients is high. To render intensive care with no prospect of success
is an immense emotional burden for both patient and relatives, and
a great socioeconomic burden for society as well. Therefore, validated
strategies that can help identify patients who will benefit from
intensive care are in demand. This study seeks to investigate whether
preadmission quality of life can act as a predictor of mortality amongst
patients admitted to the ICU.

Methods All patients (>18 years) admitted to the ICU for more than
24 hours are included. In order to assess preadmission quality of life,
the patient or close relatives complete the Short-Form 36 (SF-36)
within 72 hours after ICU admission. Mortality is evaluated from ICU
admission until 30 days hereafter. Logistic regression and receiver
operating characteristic analyses are employed to assess predictive
value for mortality using five models: SF-36 Physical Component
Summary (PCS) and APACHE II (model A), SF-36 PCS (model B), SF-36
General Health (GH) and APACHE II (model C), SF-36 GH (model D),
and APACHE II (model E). Classification tables are composed in order
to assess sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values
and likelihood ratios.

Results Preliminary results, based upon data from 175 included patients,
reveal an ICU mortality of 12.6% and 30-day mortality of 22.9%. No
patients were lost to follow-up. When the Physical Component of SF-36
(PCS) was used as an estimate of preadmission quality of life, the area
under the curve for model B (AUC = 0.80) was comparable with model E
(AUC = 0.81), and better than model A (AUC = 0.85). The General Health
item of SF-36 (GH), used as an estimate of preadmission quality of life,
gave an AUC = 0.76 (model D). All models were controlled for sex and
age.

Conclusion Preliminary results indicate that the SF-36 GH and the
SF-36 PCS are as good as APACHE II to predict mortality 30 days after
ICU admission. However, in order to conclude whether preadmission
quality of life can contribute to triage, by successfully identifying
patients suitable for intensive care, final analyses, due in 2013, are
awaited. These results will clarify whether future randomized controlled
trials, in which preadmission quality of life acts as a supplement to
triage, are justifiable.

Introduction Long-term compromise after traumatic injury is
significant; however, few modifiable factors that influence outcome
have been identified. The aim of this study was to identify acute and
early post-acute predictors of long-term recovery amenable to change
through intervention.

Methods Adults (>17 years) admitted to the ICU, Princess Alexandra
Hospital, Australia following injury were prospectively followed.
Data were collected on demographics, pre-injury health, injury
characteristics and acute care factors. Psychosocial measures (self-
efficacy (SE), illness perception (IP), post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) symptoms and psychological distress) and health status (SF-36)
were collected via questionnaire 1, 6, 12, and 24 months post injury.
Outcomes of interest were the Physical Function (PF) and Mental Health
(MH) subscales of the SF-36. Regression models were used to estimate
predictors of physical function and mental health over a 2-year period.
A subject-specific intercept in a mixed model was used to account for
repeated data from participants over time.

Results Participants (n = 123) were young (median 37, IQR 22 to
55 years), predominantly male (83%) and spent on average 3 days
in the ICU and 3 weeks in hospital. Response rates were over 55% at
each follow-up, with responders similar to nonresponders except for
being generally older. PF and MH scores improved over time, although
the averages remained below the Australian norms at 24 months.

$179

Predictors of PF included IP (8 = -1.5, 95% Cl = -3.1 to -1.1, P <0.01), SE
(B = 1.8, 95% Cl = 1.3 to 2.6, P <0.01), hospital length of stay (8 = -1.7,
95% Cl = -2.0 to -0.8, P <0.01), never having been married (B = 1.8, 95%
Cl = 0.3 to 5.5, P = 0.03), and having injury insurance (B = -2.7, 95%
Cl = -6.9 to -1.9, P <0.01). Predictors of MH included PTSD symptoms
(B = -2.4, 95% Cl -3.4 to -1.4, P <0.01), psychological distress (8 = -6.9,
95% Cl = -8.9 to -5.2, P <0.01), SE (8 = 0.6, 95% Cl = 0.2 to 1.1, P <0.01),
and unemployment (8 = -2.3, 95% Cl = -5.0 to -0.2, P = 0.04).
Conclusion Trauma ICU patients experience compromised physical
function and mental health 24 months after injury. Psychological
distress, self-efficacy and illness perception influence outcomes and are
potentially amenable to change in response to interventions initiated
during hospital stay.

Do ICU patients’ discharge characteristics change with Swiss
Diagnosis Related Groups?

Tiemli City Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P483 (doi: 10.1186/cc12421)

Introduction Swiss Diagnosis Related Groups (SwissDRG) have been
effective since 1 January 2012. The influence of this new system on
patients’ discharge characteristics from a large ICU is not known. With
the introduction of the DRG we expect patients to be discharged after
a shorter length of stay on the ICU and with higher severity of illness.
Methods The ICU of the City Hospital Triemli in Zurich has an inter-
disciplinary organization with surgical and internal medical patients,
with a maximum occupancy of 18 beds and a center function for the
surrounding hospitals. In this ongoing prospective observational
study, we collect and analyze the anonymized data of all patients
discharged from our ICU prior to and after the introduction of the
SwissDRG. The primary endpoint was the length of stay on the ICU
in hours. The secondary endpoints were the severity of illness of the
patients at the time of discharge, detected by the scoring system SAPS
Ilas well as measured by the number of readmissions to the ICU. Initially
all patients were analyzed and in a second step only patients within
percentiles 6 to 94 were considered. We also analyzed the subgroups of
patients referred internally, patients sent back to referring hospital and
patients regionalized to a homebase hospital. The statistics have been
done with SPSS and P <0.05 was considered significant.

Results We present the results of an 18-month period, 9 months prior
to and 9 months after the introduction of the SwissDRG. Data of 1,491
and 1,492 patients were analyzed, respectively. When all patients were
included, we found prior to and after the introduction of the DRGs a
comparable length of stay on the ICU (mean + SD of 52.1 + 2.2 hours vs.
50.82 + 2.2 hours), no difference in the severity of illness at discharge
detected by the SAPS II (mean + SD of 27.9 + 0.3 vs. 28.4 + 0.3) and
the number of readmissions (91 vs. 92). There was also no significant
difference when only percentiles 6 to 94 were included or when the
three subgroups were analyzed.

Conclusion Up to now, the introduction of the SwissDRG has no
influence on patients’ discharge characteristics from a large ICU. Data
assessment will continue and further data analysis has to be performed.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P484 (doi: 10.1186/cc12422)

Introduction The new Swiss financing system by means of Diagnosis
Related Groups (DRG), effective 1 January 2012, forms the basis of a
performance-based system to reimburse general hospital services.
There are only few data on the influence of DRG on ICU patients [1,2].
We expect that the introduction of the DRG in Switzerland will change
the number of admissions from external hospitals to a large ICU with
a centre function and will influence the severity of disease of the
admitted patients.

Methods The ICU of the Triemli City Hospital in Zurich has an inter-
disciplinary organisation with surgical and internal medical patients,
with a maximum occupancy of 18 beds and a centre function for
the surrounding hospitals of the region. In this prospective ongoing
observational study, we collect and analyse the anonymised data of all
patients admitted to our ICU from an external hospital during 12 months
prior to (1 January to 31 December 2011) and after (1 January to 31
December 2012) the introduction of the DRG in Switzerland. Exclusion
criteria are admissions by the emergency department, self-assignments
into the hospital and internal relocations. The primary endpoint is the
number of admissions from an external hospital to our ICU. Secondary
endpoints are the severity of the disease of the admitted patients,
detected by the scoring systems SAPS II and APACHE II as well as the
length of stay in external hospitals before admission. The statistical
analysis is descriptive.

Results We present the preliminary data for 10 months (in each case
January to October) before and after the introduction of the DRG.
We observed an increase of 9.2% (391 vs. 427 patients) of admissions
to our ICU after the introduction of the DRG. The severity of disease
determined by the SAPS Il score is unchanged (mean 26.7 vs. 26.0
points, P = 0.466). The severity of disease determined by the APACHE
Il score is significantly lower (15.4 vs. 14 points, P = 0.017). We also
noted that after the introduction of the DRG the patients were earlier
transferred from an external hospital to our ICU (mean time until
transfer 29.9 vs. 18.7 hours), but this value was not significant (P = 0.55).
Conclusion Up to now the introduction of the DRG in Switzerland
has had a complex influence on the number and the kind of patients
admitted from an external hospital to an ICU with centre function. Data
assessment and analysis will continue.

Introduction The ICU consumes almost 20% of total hospital resources,
despite accounting for less than 10% of hospital beds. Medical
cost can be divided into a fixed part, consisting of personnel and
accommodation expenses, and a variable part, determined by the
needs of each patient (medications, consumables, examinations). In
order to rationalize medical cost, estimation of expenses must be real
and individualized. The aim of this study was to assess the variable cost
of critically ill patients in a new, seven-bed, adult, general ICU, using
bottom-up costing methodology.

Methods All 138 patients who were treated during 2011, and stayed for
at least 24 hours, were included in the study. Data were retrospectively
collected from patient records and included demographics, cause
of admission, APACHE II score at admission, length of stay (LOS) and
outcome. Cost was recorded for every day and for every patient, based
on a hospital-specific cost catalogue and on national agreements. Data
are presented as mean + SEM. Analysis of data was carried out using
Graph Pad Prism 5.0., applying Student's t test.

Results The age of participants (84 men and 54 women, 71 medical and
67 surgical) was 68.75 + 1.18, APACHE II score was 18.64 + 0.61, LOS was
18.46 + 2.54, and mortality was 19%. The majority of the patients (61%)
were mechanically ventilated. The total days of ICU stay were 2,548 and
the total variable cost was €1,460,465 (€573.18 per patient and per day).
Cost per patient was subdivided as follows: medication (including drugs,
fluids, blood products, nutrition): 56.49%, examinations (including
laboratory, microbiological assays and diagnostic procedures):
22.23%, consumables: 21.26%. As for medication cost, the largest part
was comprised of antibiotics (45.69%), followed by blood products
(17.61%) and cardiovascular drugs (12.39%). Costs for medical patients
were significantly higher than those for surgical patients (P <0.0001).
Conclusion The total average cost per patient and per day was found
to be €573.18. Medication expenditure was responsible for the highest

S180

variable cost of intensive care treatment. Among drugs, antibiotics
accounted for the largest part. A medical cause of admission was
correlated with higher costs.

Audit of the medical staffing of and referrals to a mixed adult ICU in
a teaching hospital

University Hospitals of Leicester, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P486 (doi: 10.1186/cc12424)

Introduction Leicester Royal Infirmary is a (funded) 15-bed ICU, annual
admission 1,102 patients per year (ICNARC data 2011 to 2012). It houses
a broad range of specialty, has over 1,000 beds and an emergency
department (ED) responsible for 297 admissions over the 2011 to 2012
period. Unit guidelines state that a doctor should be immediately
available to the unit at all times, ideally physically present on the unit.
This audit looked in detail at each occasion a junior doctor left the unit,
the timings, reason, and outcome of each episode.

Methods Between 17 October 2011 and 14 November 2011, and
between 2 July 2012 and 30 July 2012, junior doctors on the ICU
completed a data-capture form after each occasion that they left the
unit for a clinical need. Data collected were matched to the objectives.
The 2011 audit results were communicated at the University Hospitals
of Leicester Trust ICU Audit Meeting. A system was introduced so
that daytime referrals were directed to the ICU consultant. The impact
of this intervention was assessed by the 2012 re-audit.

Results There were 105 occasions when a junior doctor left the unit
in 2011, totalling 118 hours and 38 minutes (5 days), a continuation of
the upward trend from the previous 2 years. In 2012 this reduced to 47
occasions totalling 40 hours and 55 minutes. Most attended referrals
were during the daytime, 54% in 2011 and 68% in 2012. The majority
of referrals originated from the ED/medicine, combined numbers
58% in 2011 and 38% in 2012. In 2011 only 30% of ED referrals had
been discussed with a consultant of the referring team and only 32%
of medical referrals. Just two of the 14 inappropriate ED referrals were
discussed with the referring consultant, and none of the six inappropriate
medical referrals were discussed with a medical consultant. In 2012 just
33% of ED/medical referrals had prior discussion with a consultant from
the referring team. At the point of leaving, the ICU was left without a
doctor on 22 occasions in 2011 and six occasions in the 2012 audit. Most
occasions occurred at either night shift/weekend (86% in 2011/100%
in 2012). Referral resulted in a patient being admitted to the ICU on 20
occasions in 2011 and 12 in 2012.

Conclusion The latest audit follows introduction of a referral system
directly to the ICU consultant and may account for the reduction in
numbers of referrals attended by junior doctors. ED/medicine persist
as the main source of referral to the ICU. Discussion with the referring
team consultant may reduce inappropriate referrals. ICU staffing
should not be reduced.

Methods A retrospective cohort study performed on patients in the
ICU of Hospital Regional de Samambaia over a period of 4 years, from
January 2008 to December 2011. The patients were allocated into two
groups: patients who waited longer than 6 hours, long waiting period

----$$$$----$$$$----

(LWP, n = 300); and patients whose waiting time was equal to or less
than that period, short waiting period (SWP, n = 113).

Results In total, 413 patients were included, 300 of which belonged to
the LWP group (65.4%). For the entire cohort, the mean APACHE Il score
was 19 + 7, the mean age was 52 + 22 years, and 211 patients were male
(51.1%). The LWP group did not show difference in the APACHE II score
(19+ 7 vs. 18+ 8, P=0.13), but was older (55 + 20 vs. 49 + 23, P=0.01).
LWP also had a higher incidence of primary bloodstream infection (23.8%
vs. 10.4%, P=0.01) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (10.2%
vs. 1.9%, P = 0.01). LWP patients had higher mortality (37.8% vs. 25.9%,
P=0.02) and longer ICU LOS (21 + 47 vs. 14 + 18 days, P= 0.01). Relative
risk for death in the LWP was 1.74 (95% Cl: 1.11 to 2.72).

Conclusion Despite showing no significant differences on APACHE II
scores from the SWP group, patients from the LWP group presented
greater incidence of primary bloodstream infection, catheter-
associated urinary tract infection, higher mortality outcomes and
longer ICU LOS.

Introduction Intensivists are expected to have many roles during
and after a major disaster/catastrophe; that is, triage, intensive care,
education for people, and so forth. The roles of intensivists against
special disaster or nuclear disaster are studied based on actual
experiences.

Methods Several disasters are studied. The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear
plant explosion after the Higashinihon earthquake 2011 was medically
reviewed based on the total 30-day stay on-site in addition to several days
around the site. The Chernobyl incident 1986 was inspected 15 years
after the incident. Other nuclear disasters are included.

Results Many serious problems were revealed in the medical teams,
which are as follows: inappropriate basic preparedness against large
special disasters, including nuclear disaster; lack of appropriate
education and training for medical teams against nuclear disaster —
that is, most members of Japan DMAT or the disaster medical assistance
team are still laypersons; incorrect standard/rules of Japan DMAT, which
were excessively focused upon cure of the usual type of injury and
planned short period or nearly 48 hours, which should be abandoned;
and insufficient consideration to the weak/vulnerable people or CWAP,
children, (pregnant) women, aged people, and the poor people/sicker
patients. Many of them died because of an insufficient emergency
transportation system from their contaminated houses or hospital.
Conclusion In order to cope with the special disasters, such as NBC
or nuclear, biological and chemical disaster, it is insufficient to take
makeshift measures or use cheap tricks. Working out the systematization
of disaster medicine, based upon the academic viewpoints and
philosophy/reliability, is essential to protect the people and the nation.

Introduction The World Bank has warned that the rapid growth of the
world’s urban population can only be accommodated safely if cities
adequately develop key infrastructure, such as the provision of acute
care resources. Yet, even basic descriptive information on urban acute
care supply and demand is extremely limited. We therefore conducted
a pilot assessment across seven diverse urban settings across the world.
Methods We selected a convenience sample of seven large cities with
varying geographical and socioeconomic characteristics: Boston, Paris,
Bogota, Recife, Liaocheng, Chennai, and Kumasi. To estimate acute care
supply, we developed an instrument to collect data on acute and critical
care infrastructure. We collected data from municipal authorities and
local research collaborators. We expressed the burden of acute disease
as the number of deaths due to acute illnesses, estimated from the
2008 Global Burden of Disease Study. Results were expressed as acute
care supply and acute deaths per 100,000 population and acute care
supply per 100 acute deaths.

Results The supply of hospital beds varied from 72.4/100,000
population in Kumasi to 245.8/100,000 in Boston. ICU beds with
capacity for invasive mechanical ventilation and intensive nursing
services ranged from 0.4/100,000 in Kumasi to 19/100,000 population
in Boston. The number of ambulances varied 70-fold between cities.
The gap between cities widened when demand was estimated based
on disease burden, with a 70-fold difference between cities in ICU
beds/acute deaths. In general, most of the data were unavailable from
municipal authorities.

Conclusion The provision of acute care services, a key aspect of urban
infrastructure, varied substantially across the seven diverse urban
settings we studied. Furthermore, the local municipal authorities
generally appeared to have little knowledge of their acute care
infrastructure, with implications for future planning and development.

Introduction Medical and surgical patients use the ICU differently.
Resources may not always be allocated by severity of illness, but by
custom or habit, particularly if different groups administer bed control
and triage. Specialty-specific differences may exist even when a single
team controls triage. Variability in resource utilization has important
implications for cost-containment and triage.

Methods Patients admitted to a single, closed medical/surgical
ICU with full-time intensivists and unified triage control in a large,
university-afflliated hospital were evaluated during 2011 to 2012.

stay, P = 0.014 for both medical and surgical patients. Medical patients
are sicker on admission and D/C from the ICU than surgical patients
(P <0.05) (Figure 1).

Conclusion ICU utilization differed by patient type even with unified
triage control within a single unit. Surgical patients were less severely
ill on admission to and D/C from the ICU. A significant percentage of
medical and surgical patients are D/C within 1 day and may be more
efficiently served in a less resource-intensive environment. The reasons
for the differences in ICU utilization for surgical versus medical patients
require clarification and may have implications for both resource
utilization and cost.

Introduction Interest in safety and clinical outcomes of inpatients
has been growing in Japan, because the 100,000 Lives Campaign was
introduced under the Japanese Patient Safety Act in 2008. In this act,
an introduction of the Rapid Response System (RRS) was one of the
mainstreams to inpatients’ care. However, many Japanese healthcare
providers cannot understand how to achieve the introduction of
the RRS, because there are few who have knowledge of the system.
Therefore, we developed a new introductory training course for
the RRS. The educational effectiveness was analyzed through the
surveillance questionnaires after the course.

Methods The educational program includes a lecture series concern-
ing the outline and management methods, introduction of facilities
that have already deployed, small group discussions, and teaching
methods-of-training for the medical emergency team using a simulator.
Evaluation was made in the five-point scale by 82 participants (58
physicians, 16 nurses and eight other professions) throughout seven
courses. The questionnaires are: A. understanding of RRS, B. knowledge
acquisition about patient safety, C. expectation for decreasing the
cardiopulmonary arrest by RRS, and D. expectation for decreasing the
psychological burden by RRS.

Results Seventy-three participants (89.0%) answered the question-
naires. The numbers of participants who scored more than four points
were as follows: A. was 71 (97.2%), B. was 70 (95.9%), C. was 64 (87.7%),
and D. was 68 (93.2%), respectively. The majority of participants
obtained the correct knowledge, and had a solid understanding for
the RRS. It was evident that providing abundant material and didactic
lectures traced from the introduction to management, and collecting
and resolving the questions, promoted comprehension. However,
there is a limitation of whether or not the participants introduce the
RRS into their own institutions. It is essential to improve the course and
continue to support the activities of the participants.

Conclusion Our training course may promote the introduction and
dissemination of the RRS in Japan.

Introduction The management of emergency medical admissions has
been a subject of recent clinical incidents. There was a high percentage
of patients that were referred to the ICU by staff in training, and 21%
of referrals were made by junior doctors. Consultant physicians had no
knowledge of the case in 57% of referrals.
Methods A prospective study of 21 cases of referrals and admissions to
the ICU was conducted at the Glasgow Victoria Infirmary Hospital from
8 to 21 September 2012. A questionnaire was produced relating to the
referrals, admissions, seniority involvement, cause of referral, and time
of patient review by the ICU consultant after ICU admission. They were
distributed to specialist registrars and the ICU consultants. All data
were electronically recorded into an Excel database. Questionnaires
that were not completely filled were further investigated using patient
clinical notes and contact with medical staff. Information that may
identify a patient or clinician was removed from the questionnaire for
confidentiality purposes.
Results Twenty-one complete questionnaires were collected. Fifty-
seven percent (12/21) of cases involved admission to the ICU. Nine
percent of the cases involved contacting either a specialist registrar
or ICU consultant intensivist for assistance in practical procedures. Of
the patients admitted to the ICU, 33% (4/12) were from medical wards,
33% were admitted from A&E. Consultants were the most common
professionals who referred patients to critical care (48%; 10/21).
Fourteen percent of cases (3/21) involved the referral of patients into
ICU by a junior doctor, but only one of the referrals was accepted by
the ICU intensivist. Consultants referred or were aware of the referral
in 71% (15/21) of cases. Of admissions, 58% (7/12) were accepted by
the ICU consultant and the remaining by the specialist registrars. All
accepted were acknowledged by the ICU consultant. After admission
all of the patients were reviewed by the ICU consultant and the time of
review after admission was on average 1 hour 23 minutes (25 minutes
to 3 hours 45 minutes).
Conclusion There is still an issue with junior doctors referring patients
to the ICU without the acknowledgement of consultant physicians,
resulting in unnecessary admissions and decreased time that ICU
trainees spend in the ICU. There are more appropriate ICU admissions
when there is involvement with seniority. Contact with ICU staff to
perform practical procedures outside the ICU and not about admissions
should be explored further.

Introduction Teaching of medical ethical issues including confiden-
tiality and consent have long been a small part of the medical
curriculum. These issues are more complex in an ICU where patients
may lack capacity. Documents such as Good Medical Practice 1995,
Confidentiality 2009 and the Mental Capacity Act 2005 give guidance
to medical professionals in these matters in the UK.

Methods A questionnaire was distributed amongst staff in four ICUs in
South London. Results were analysed according to level of experience
and background (medical/nursing or allied health professional (AHP)).
Results Of 225 questionnaires distributed, the response rate was
66% (31% doctors, 56% nurses and 13% AHP). Staff with either less
than 1 year experience or greater than 10 years experience had the
greatest exposure to the Mental Capacity Act and Data Protection
Act, suggesting a gap in knowledge in staff with intermediate
experience. Knowledge of the Caldicott principles were unaffected
by experience, with many experienced respondents having ‘No Idea’
The majority of respondents (unaffected by experience) felt that

----$$$$----$$$$----
Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2
http://ccforum.com/supplements/17/S2

when giving information to relatives face to face, relatives should be
kept fully informed. When giving information over the telephone,
most doctors felt the response should be tailored to the knowledge
of the person being spoken to whilst nurses were split between
tailoring the response, giving full information, setting up a password
system and not giving any information at all. Most respondents felt
date of birth and hospital number constituted ‘Patient Identifiable
Information. However, experienced staff did not appreciate the
importance of unusual diagnosis and clinical photographs as also
being able to identify patients. Similarly, the majority knew that the
patient themselves identified the ‘Next of Kin’ but 7% (unaffected
by experience) felt this was decided by the family and felt the family
could decide on resuscitation status. When consent is required for an
elective procedure in a patient who lacks capacity, doctors tended
to have a better understanding of the need to delay the procedure
where possible than nurses, the majority of which felt this could be
decided by the next of kin or two consultant doctors. Most doctors
felt that ‘Acting in the Patient’s Best Interests’ would mean doing what
would give the patient the best outcome rather than doing what the
patient would have wanted (unaffected by experience). The majority
of staff, on answering this questionnaire, felt that they lacked sufficient
knowledge on the subject and most felt annual reminders would be
useful.

Conclusion The ICU is an environment where issues of consent,
confidentiality and disclosure of information occur daily. Staff feel they
lack knowledge in these areas that is unaffected by their experience.
We need to ensure that all staff have the necessary knowledge to deal
with these situations.

Survey of alcohol-related admissions to critical care and the
resource and financial implications

ABMU University Trust, Swansea, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P494 (doi: 10.1186/cc12432)

Introduction Alcohol-related hospital and ICU admissions are known
to have a huge impact on healthcare resources in the UK. Excessive
use of alcohol is independently associated with sepsis, septic shock
and hospital mortality among ICU patients. This study assesses the
relationship between alcohol abuse and intensive care resource
utilisation in a mixed medical, surgical and neurosurgical ICU.
Methods A_ prospective survey of emergency alcohol-related
admissions over a 1-year period was undertaken at a tertiary university
adult general and neurosurgical ICU. All patients were screened for
acute and chronic alcohol abuse on admission. Acute alcohol abuse was
defined as being intoxicated with alcohol at the time of admission and
chronic alcohol abuse was defined as chronic alcohol use exceeding
recommended UK national guidelines on consumption. The amount
of alcohol consumption was obtained, diagnosis on admission, ICU
and hospital mortality, length of stay, and total cost were recorded. All
patients were screened for alcohol-related comorbidities. Comparative
retrospective data were obtained for the same time period for
nonalcohol-related emergency ICU admissions. Data were analyzed
using SPSS.

Results In total, 7.7% of patients were admitted with a history
of acute/chronic alcohol excess. Sixty-seven per cent of alcohol-
related admissions were due to acute alcohol excess. Neurosurgical
patients admitted due to alcohol excess had higher ITU mortality
than nonalcohol-related neurosurgical patients: 32.1% versus 14.39%
(P = 0.02), respectively. Ninety-three per cent of alcohol-related
neurosurgical admissions were caused by acute alcohol intoxication.
The intensive care cost was significantly higher for alcohol-related
(£12,396 per patient) compared with nonalcohol-related neurosurgical
admissions (£7,284 per patient). Of the medical patients admitted,
60% of these admissions were due to acute alcohol excess. The cost
of intensive care treatment was lower for alcohol-related medical
admissions.

Conclusion This is one of the largest studies of alcohol-related
admissions to critical care. Our survey confirms that alcohol-related
admissions to the ICU are commonplace; however, our frequency

$183

is significantly less than previously reported. Our study reveals
interspecialty variations in demographic data, APACHE Il scores,
mortality and cost of admission. Neurosurgical alcohol-related
admissions bear higher mortality and result in greater resource
utilisation relative to nonalcohol-related neurosurgical admissions.
Alcohol continues to burden both our patients and critical care.

Association of sleep disordered breathing with clinical trajectories
in patients undergoing cardiac surgery

University of Heidelberg, Germany

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P495 (doi: 10.1186/cc12433)

Introduction The prevalence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB)
is presumably high among individuals with cardiac diseases [1],
nonetheless SDB remains predominantly undiagnosed. However,
unrecognized SDB might have relevant impact on the postoperative
course of patients undergoing cardiac surgery [2].

Methods Polygraphic recordings of 181 patients, without previous
diagnosis of SDB, undergoing standard cardiac surgical procedures
with extracorporeal circulation were obtained during a preoperative
night. The apnea—hypopnea index (AHI - the number of apneas,
hypopneas per hour recorded) was determined and compared with
clinical characteristics and postoperative course.

Results The prevalence of SDB was considerably high among all
examined patients. Median AHI was 20.8 (interquartile range, 10.6 to
36.4). Preoperative AHI was >30 in 32% of all examined individuals.
During the first three postoperative days, preoperative AHI >30 was
associated with a prolonged weaning time, a reduced oxygenation
index (arterial pO,/FiO.,), an impaired kidney function, an augmented
inflammatory response and an overall increased length of stay in the
ICU. The observed association of high preoperative AHI values with
postoperative clinical characteristics remained statistically significant
throughout the first three postoperative days.

Conclusion Undiagnosed SDB is highly prevalent among cardiac
surgical patients. Clinical trajectories of individuals with severe SDB
are described by a prolonged recovery of pulmonary function, delayed
weaning and a pronounced inflammatory response after surgery.
Screening for SDB might identify patients that are susceptible for a
complicated postoperative course.

Can massage therapy help cardiac patients? A literature review plus
a case study

A Fenlon

St Georges NHS Trust, London, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P496 (doi: 10.1186/cc12434)

Introduction A literature review was performed to assess whether
massage benefits patients postoperatively following coronary bypass
grafts (CABG) and or valve replacement/repair. A case study on a patient
who had suffered a hypoxic brain post cardiac arrest was conducted.
Methods A review on MEDLINE and Cochrane using search terms
massage, cardiac and ICU identified nine research papers on the
benefits of massage postoperatively for the aforementioned patient
group. Other papers were listed but unrelated to cardiac surgery. None
of the nine papers identified for this review were ICU specific in the title
but the ICU was mentioned in the main text body. For the purpose of
this review the selected papers are researching the effects of massage
on physiological parameters, anxiety, pain, calm and perceived stress
indicators in the CABG and/or valve repair/replacement. Out of these
nine papers, one is British (2002). Five are American (2006 to 2012),
two are Brazilian (2010) and one is an Indian paper (2010). All papers
are randomised control trials (RCTs). Papers written prior to 1999 were
excluded from this literature review.

----$$$$----$$$$----
Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2

Results Research from 1999 states there are methodological errors
in prior papers and very few large-scale studies prior to this date,
destabilising the validity and reliability of research from the papers
written before 1999. The later research suggests that any change in
the measured physiological parameters of blood pressure, heart rate
and respiratory rate are insignificant (P >0.05). Pain, anxiety, rest and
a calm score perform better with P >4.71 overall. Another American
study showed that the length of stay is reduced if a patient receives
healing touch postoperatively. However, in one RCT pain and anxiety
increases and in some case SpO, decreases. A case study was chosen
by the author and the results support the benefits of massage with the
cardiac patient group.

Conclusion There appears to be some benefits but larger-scale studies
are required within this and other ICUs in Britain. The author will be
inquiring at her workplace whether further studies can be performed
and whether she can initiate the research. She will identify further case
studies and trial massage on select patients. The author recommends
training for nurses interested in massage therapy so a bigger caseload
can be identified.

Ischemic stroke in different ICU types

M Damasceno, F Rodriguez, R Turon

Hospital de Clinicas de Niterdi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P497 (doi: 10.1186/cc12435)

Introduction In our hospital there are a general intensive care unit
(GICU) and a neurointensive care unit (NICU). Despite the preference
for the NICU, in both there are admissions for ischemic stroke. There
are different staff for each ICU, with the same physician’s leadership.
We have decided to evaluate the performance of both ICUs, analysing
whether there are differences in results as some authors publish best
results in specialized ICUs.

Methods Using prospectively collected data, we undertook a
retrospective evaluation of all patients admitted to the GICU and NICU
of our hospital with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke, from December
2010 to November 2012. In both ICUs there are intensivists, but in the
NICU the intensivists have special expertise in neuroscience. Data were
collected from Epimedmonitor.

Results A total of 3,854 admissions were registered in the period in
both ICUs, with 257 (6.7%) being by ischemic stroke - 49 in GICU and
208 in NICU. Mean age of patients: 73 years in GICU and 70.1 years in
NICU. Admissions from emergency unit: 44 (89.8%) GICU, 181 (87%)
NICU. Mean SAPS 3 score: 50.7 (29 to 71) GICU, 50.6 (29 to 98) NICU.
Patients admitted with infection: 6 (12.2%) GICU, 10 (4.81%) NICU. Mean
Charlson comorbidity index points: 1.61 (median 1.0) GICU, 1.1 (median
1.0) NICU. Mean length of ICU stay: 4.8 days (median 3) GICU, 4.3 days
(median 3) NICU. Mean length of hospital stay: 12.2 days (median
8) GICU, 14.5 days (median 8) NICU. Predicted hospital mortality
(mean + SD): 20.07% + 13.48 GICU, 20.4% + 13.83 NICU. Hospital
mortality rate: 12.5% GICU, 5.39% NICU. Observed-to-expected (O/E)
mortality ratios: 0.62 GICU, 0.26 NICU.

Conclusion Despite the similar proportions numbers for patients in
both ICUs, the mortality rate and the O/E mortality ratio for ischemic
stroke were higher in patients of the GICU when compared with the
NICU.

Prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the surgical ICU
at Siriraj Hospital

CH Pisitsak, O Chaiwat

Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P498 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12436)

Introduction VAP has continued to be a major cause of morbidity
and mortality in critically ill patients in Thailand for decades. Previous
research found that the implementation of VAP care bundles and the

$184

educational program can reduce VAP incidence in the ICU [1]. In this
research we aimed to observe the reduction of VAP incidence after the
implementation of VAP care bundles to ICU medical personnel.
Methods Inclusion criteria: all adult surgical patients (>18 years old)
who are on ventilatory support in the surgical ICU at Siriraj Hospital.
There are two groups, divided into pre-educational group (group |) and
post-educational group (group II) (n = 220/group). We also observed
the adherence rate to VAP care bundles according to the educational
program. The pretest and post-test to determine the efficacy of the
educational program were done. The VAP care bundles consisted of
weaning according to weaning protocol, sedation vacation, head-
of-bed elevation, measurement of cuff pressures four times/day, 2%
chlorhexidine use for mouth care and emptying of ventilator circuit
condensate.

Results There were 45.38 and 25.25 episodes of VAP per 1,000 ventilator-
days in group | and group Il, respectively (P = 0.020). The incidence of
VAP was 21.82% in group | and 9.09% in group II (P = 0.000). There was
significant reduction in the length of ventilatory support per person
(group | = 2, group II = 1 (median), P = 0.013, 95% Cl = 0.319 to 0.936)
and mortality rate (group | = 15.5%, group II = 8.2%, P = 0.017). There
was no significant difference in LOI, LOH and ATB cost. The pretest
scores were 15.53 and 17.53 on average from 40 medical personnel in
group | and group Il, respectively (P = 0.000). The head-of-bed elevation
adherence rate was improved after the educational program (group
| = 50.1%, group II = 70.36%, P = 0.017). But the adherence to other
bundles was not improved. See Tables 1 and 2.

Introduction The 2009 H1N1 pandemic caused surges of severely ill
patients with viral pneumonia requiring ventilation and particularly
affected high-dependency medical services such as ICUs in settings
that lack sufficient personnel and resources to provide optimal care.
Ministries of Health of several countries asked the World Health
Organization (WHO) for clinical management guidance.

Methods We developed (2009 to 2011) and piloted (2011 to 2012)
curriculum and training materials targeted at clinicians without formal
critical care training who care for adult and paediatric patients with
severe acute respiratory infections in ICUs in resource-limited settings.
Results With contributions from 37 global experts, we developed a
3-day course including 14 learning units in early recognition, patho-
physiology, oxygen therapy, influenza diagnostics, infection control,
resuscitation of septic shock, antimicrobial therapy, monitoring, lung-
protective ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome, sedation,
weaning, preventive care, quality improvement, and ethics. Teaching
techniques are appropriate for adult learners and include short
slideshow-based lectures, interactive small-group role-play sessions
and a toolkit with practical resources such as checklists. With funding
from the WHO and local Ministries of Health, the training course was
piloted among 67 clinician participants in the Caribbean and Indonesia
(29 and 38, respectively) and taught by external critical care specialists.
Participants’ daily evaluations rated all units as at least very good.
Test scores to assess participant critical care knowledge improved
significantly from before the training to immediately after (Caribbean,
58 to 80%; Indonesia, 56 to 75%; P <0.001 for both).

Conclusion It was feasible to develop and deliver an advanced critical
care curriculum and related training materials in a short, interactive
workshop for noncritical care trained clinicians in resource-limited
settings. However, the small-scale programme was labour and time
intensive. Widespread dissemination of these materials requires
identification of target countries, engagement of Ministries of Health,
and secure funding. Longer-term evaluation is necessary to determine
whether such programmes improve processes of care and clinical
outcomes for critically ill patients.

Quality assurance in severe sepsis: an individualised audit/feedback
system results in substantial improvements at a UK teaching
hospital

M Simmonds, E Blyth, W Robson, M Chikhani

Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P500 (doi: 10.1186/cc12438)

Introduction Following our study of severe sepsis care across three
centres [1], we aimed to introduce a rapid feedback mechanism into
our rolling audit programme. Whilst previous audits raised awareness
of severe sepsis, only whole organisation performance was reported
and no feedback was given to individual clinicians. It is recognised that
such feedback loops can improve clinical practice [2].

Methods Patients admitted to critical care (58 beds, four units) with
a primary admission diagnosis of infection were screened for severe
sepsis. Pre-ICU care was then audited against the Surviving Sepsis
Guidelines [3]. Time zero is defined as when criteria for severe sepsis
were first met. An individualised traffic-light report was then generated
and emailed to the patient’s consultant and other stakeholders
involved in care (Figure 1). We aimed to report cases within 7 days of
critical care admission. A cumulative report is generated monthly to
track organisation-wide performance.

Results Since November 2011, 153 cases of severe sepsis have been

audited and reported back to clinicians. Compliance with antibiotics

in <1 hour has risen from 35 to 75% and compliance with the pre-

ICU elements of the resuscitation bundle has risen from 20 to 70%

(Figure 2). Feedback from clinicians has been encouraging as our

reports highlight both positive and negative examples of practice.

Conclusion Individualised feedback on sepsis care has led to

substantial improvements in guideline compliance. This concept could

be translated to other time-dependent patient pathways.

Hospital Regional Carlos Haya, Mdlaga, Spain

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P501 (doi: 10.1186/cc12439)

Introduction When we talk about safety culture, we speak of being
aware that things can go wrong. We must be able to recognize mistakes
and learn from them, sharing that information fairly and impartially
to try to prevent its recurrence. Organizations such as the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) have developed tools to help
organizations measure their safety culture and there is little information
about our country.

Methods A descriptive survey study. We sent the Spanish version of the
questionnaire on patient safety culture (AHRQ) to the nursing staff of a
polyvalent ICU of 42 beds in a tertiary hospital.

Results The questionnaire was sent to 179 nurses, receiving correctly
answered 88 surveys (response rate of 49.16%). On a scale of 0 to
10, 6.97 points was obtained to estimate the safety climate for staff
respondents. The item best scored was teamwork in the unit (65.9%).
Detected as a fortress, ‘communication between nurses at shift
changes’ (76.1% positive responses). The worst rating was obtained in
the section on human resources, followed by management support in
the field of patient safety.

Conclusion The perception of safety culture in an ICU by nursing staff is
far from optimal levels. The team work dimension was identified as the
most valued by workers, with the transmission of information on shift
changes the most valued item.

Physico-technical medicine: teaching technical skills to the
intensivist

J Seifried, S Richter, J Guttmann, S Schumann

University Medical Center Freiburg, Germany

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P502 (doi: 10.1186/cc12440)

Introduction The requirements for the intensivist in handling medical
technology are constantly growing. It appears necessary to acquire
technological competences particularly within the fields of medical
technology and physics. In the master’s degree program ‘MasterOnline
Physico-Technical Medicine, such technical authority is conveyed.
To cope with the intensive vocational situation of the physician,
this study course follows the blended-learning concept; that is, it is
conceived as an online study course with small portions of intermittent
presence phases. Within the first year, technical basic skills such as
‘measurement technique’ ‘informatics; and ‘advanced physics’ are
covered. Subsequently, two of various advanced courses in different
fields of medical technology (‘technology in intensive care medicine’,
‘technology in surgery; ‘technical cardiology’ ‘radiology’ and other) are
selected.

Methods In a survey, we evaluated the study course. Therefore, a
questionnaire was distributed among all students including the topics
course contents, learning materials, time management, supervision,
and overall impression. The students were asked to score their
agreement to the statements ‘content is well structured’ ‘content
extent is appropriate’ and ‘content is relevant for medical purposes’ on
a scale ranging from 1 (fully disagree) to 5 (fully agree).

Results The students participated actively in this study course with
highest motivation and large commitment. The students’ workload
was in the targeted range of about 10 hours/week. Content structure
was scored with 4.3 + 0.1, content extent with 4.1 + 0.2 and medical
relevance with 4.3 + 0.2.

Conclusion The blended-learning concept fulfills the requirements
for occupation-accompanying continued medical education, since it
offers the possibility to study self-employed accessing text documents,
lecture recordings, and electronic lectures and to convert in
concentrated presence phases this knowledge into practical exercises.

Introduction The first-hour protocol determines the patient-specific
resources for the start of an ICU stay [1]. Staff resources are decided
through triage. Task charts direct the start of intensive care. Our primary
goal is to improve patient care.

Methods A triage method (red, yellow, green) is used to manage ICU
resources according to the severity of illness. For example, one doctor
and one nurse would admit a stable (green) patient coming from the
operating room for postoperative ICU care. A patient in septic shock
with multiple organ disorder (red), on the other hand, would be
admitted by a team of two doctors and three nurses. Each staff member
has atask chart ina checking-list format. Also, an admission chart is used
to improve data collection. The use of the protocol started as a pilot
study in early 2012. Simulation education for staff members started in
August 2012 and has included video recordings and debriefing of each
simulated ICU admission. Primary goal-directed therapy goals have
been mean arterial pressure (MAP >65 mmHg), SpO, >94%, timing
of the laboratory tests, start of antibiotics, and blood glucose level
6 to 8 mmol/l. Quality indicators have been followed from the data
provided by The Finnish Intensive Care Consortium. Questionnaires for
the staff members have been used to evaluate opinions about the first-
hour protocol.

Results According to the questionnaire replies, 80% (n = 64/80) of our
nurses estimate that the first-hour protocol has improved the starting
process of our patients’ intensive care. Twenty percent (n = 16/80) of the

$186

nurses considered that the protocol has no effect, and none thought
it to be adverse for patient care. Corresponding numbers for our ICU
doctors were 87% (beneficial n = 13/15), 13% (no effect n = 2/15) and
0% (adverse). Furthermore, 82.5% (n = 66/80) of the nurses replied that
education of new nurse staff members has improved because of the
first-hour protocol. A total of 17.5% (n = 14/80) thought there has been
no effect, and none considered the protocol harmful for education.
For ICU doctors the protocol did not bring either clear educational
advantages or disadvantages. The variable life-adjusted display curves
(The Finnish Intensive Care Consortium) have shown improvement in
our patient care after the implementation of the first-hour protocol.
However, we cannot determine whether it is a significant factor in our
intensive care results.

Conclusion The first-hour protocol has helped us in resource
management, start of the patients’ intensive care and education of
nursing staff.

Influence of critical care nurse education and work environment on
outcomes of mechanically ventilated older adults

DM Kelly’, LH Aiken?

‘University of Pittsburgh, PA, USA; University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia,
PA, USA

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P504 (doi: 10.1186/cc12442)

Introduction Demand for critical care services is increasing yet a
comprehensive understanding of how critical care nurses — the largest
group of ICU direct care providers — impact outcomes remains unclear.
The purpose of this study was to determine how critical care nurse
education (hospital proportion of bachelor’s prepared ICU nurses) and
ICU work environment influenced 30-day mortality of mechanically
ventilated older adults.

Methods A multi-state cross-sectional nurse survey was linked to
hospital administrative data and Medicare claims (2006 to 2008). The
final sample included 55,159 mechanically ventilated older adults in 303
hospitals. Logistic regression modeling was employed to jointly assess
the relationship of critical care nurse education, work environment and
staffing on 30-day mortality while adjusting for hospital and patient
characteristics and accounting for clustering.

Results A 10% increase in the proportion of ICU nurses with a bachelor’s
degree or higher was associated with 2% lower odds of death while
controlling for patient and hospital characteristics. Patients cared for
in better work environments experienced 11% lower odds of risk-
adjusted death than those cared for in poorer ICU work environments.
Conclusion Patients cared for in hospitals with a greater proportion of
bachelor’s prepared ICU nurses and in better ICU work environments
experienced significantly lower odds of death. As the demand for
critical care services increases, attention to the education level of ICU
nurses and ICU work environment may be warranted to optimize
currently available resources and potentially yield better outcomes.

Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain
Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P505 (doi: 10.1186/cc12443)

Introduction Information about big hospital geographical transfer is
scarce in the medical literature. On 20 February 2011 our hospital (in fact,
a big university complex) was transferred from their previous location
in the north-center of our city towards a new southern peripheral,
geographical location. This transfer has been done without any changes
in assisted population or nursing/medical staff. The only change was a
slight increase in bed number (21 to 24). Our aim is to analyze changes
in activity indexes (length of stay, occupancy rate, and so forth) and case
mix (origin, previous quality of life and NYHA score, main diagnostic
groups, severity scores, in-ICU and in-hospital mortality).

----$$$$----$$$$----
Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2
http://ccforum.com/supplements/17/S2

Methods To compare our number of admissions, related activity and
case-mix indicators 1 year before and after the geographical change
was done. We analyzed our whole number of patients admitted to the
ICU. We used the chi-square test for categorical variables and one-way
analysis of variance for quantitative data. Minitab and Statbas statistical
programs were used. We plotted activity data using the Barber-
Johnson 1 diagram.
Results A total of 2,774 cases (63% males; mean age 61 years) were
admitted to our ICU during the period (1 year before and after the
transfer). No differences between both groups were founded in
demographic data, Knaus score and NYHA status. Regarding their
origin, we found more patients admitted from other hospital centers
(20 vs. 29%; P <0.001). APACHE II score increased from 17.24 to 19.08%
(P <0.001) and a slight increase change in SAPS 3 score was also found
(52.29 to 53.75; P <0.01). Our in-ICU mortality remains lower (15.5
to 15.6%) whereas observed mortality decreased (22.37 to 19.88%;
P <0.001). An increase in our neurologic patients has been the most
consistent change regarding diagnostic groups. The activity indexes
show a slightly decrease in occupancy rate (79.2 vs. 76.8).
Conclusion According to the previous data our ICU seems to perform
better in the new location with a decrease in the standardized mortality
rate. On the other hand, we are admitting more patients transferred
from other hospitals. A better occupancy rate was found.

Are general wards sufficiently staffed to care for level 1 patients?
G Rajendran, C Tjen, S Hutchinson, S Fletcher

Norfolk & Norwich University Hospital, Norwich, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P506 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12444)

Introduction There are several definitions of level 1 (L1) care, all refer
to a group at risk of clinical deterioration on the ward [1-3]. There is
evidence that ward patients who become acutely unwell often receive
suboptimal care [4]. A regional study commissioned by Norfolk, Suffolk
& Cambridgeshire Critical Care Network (NSCCCN) found that a majority
of ward patients may be of L1 dependency and death rates appear to be
correlated with L1 status. We aim to examine the relationship between
the ward distribution of illness acuity, staffing and patient outcome.
Methods Data were collected as part of NSCCCN’s observational
prevalence study in 2010. Ward surveys included acuity of illness,
staffing levels and skill mix. Secondary data were obtained from the
Patient Administration System. Emergency, oncology, paediatric and
maternity units were excluded.
Results Complete datasets were obtained from 1,402 patients in 22
wards in our university hospital over two seasons. This constitutes
98.3% of inpatients from those wards. The mean ward occupancy rate
was 94% (10th to 90th percentile: 85% to 100%). At least one L1 acuity
criterion was scored by 898 (64%) patients, with 25% from geriatrics
followed by orthopaedics (17%) and general surgery (10%). Each ward
had an average of eight qualified nursing staff (range: 4 to 12) equating
to an average staff:patient ratio (SPr) of 0.253. There was no correlation
between ward occupancy and nursing staff (Pearson correlation, corr:
0.55), nor between prevalence of L1 criteria and staffing (corr: 0.34). The
admission rate to intensive care was noted to be higher if the patients
were nursed in a ward with lower than average SPr compared with
higher SPr (2.7% vs. 1.2%, P = 0.058 Fisher's exact), but this was not
Statistically significant. Senior nursing (Band 6) staff were part of the
skill mix on only nine of 44 ward surveys.
Conclusion Better outcome with improved SPr may be unsurprising,
although if proven conclusively would significantly inform workforce
planning. Lack of correlation between staffing levels and occupancy or
acuity is also interesting given that we know L1 criteria are associated
with worse outcome.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P507 (doi: 10.1186/cc12445)

Introduction Prolonged shifts, workload, stress, and different con-
flicts are associated with burnout, loss of psychological wellbeing,
and probably with an inadequate sleep quality (ISQ). This relevant
disturbance leads to deterioration of the work performance, may impair
quality of care provided to patients and increases the incidence of
serious adverse events. The objective was to determine the prevalence
of ISQ and sleepiness among Uruguayan ICU workers, and to evaluate
risk factors associated with ISQ.

Methods A survey was conducted in six Uruguayan ICUs. The sleep
quality was evaluated on the basis of the Pittsburgh score (PS), and the
sleepiness was identified by the Epworth scale. ISQ was defined as PS
greater than 5 points and sleepiness by an Epworth scale higher than
6 points. ICU’s, patient's, and clinician’s characteristics were assessed for
their association with the prevalence of ISQ. All variables with P <0.2
in univariate analysis were included in a model of ordinal regression.
P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results The survey was completed by 129 ICU workers. The global
prevalence of ISQ in ICU was 67.4%. ISQ was observed in 45% of
physicians and 82% of nurses and nurses assistant (P <0.001). Sleep
medication was used by 13.3% of the ICU team. Univariate analysis
showed that ISQ was significantly associated with sex (73% vs.
43%, P = 0.03 in women and men, respectively), marital status (84%
vs. 61%, P = 0.01 in single and couple workers, respectively), more
than 60 hours working in the last week (76% vs. 61%, P = 0.07) and
less than 6 sleeping hours (95% vs. 54%, P <0.0001). Multivariable
analysis demonstrated that a sleep duration less than 6 hours was
independently associated with ISQ (OR = 24.5; 95% Cl = 5.2 to 115.8;
P <0.0001). Furthermore, pathologic sleepiness was present in 59.3%
of ICU workers. Sleepiness was independently associated with use of
sleep medication (OR = 5.9; 95% Cl = 1.2 to 28.5; P= 0.025).
Conclusion The prevalence of ISQ and sleepiness is very high among
ICU workers. Those disturbances are independently associated with a
sleep duration less than 6 hours, and sleep medication use, respectively.
These results highlights that strategies to decrease ISQ and sleepiness
in ICU clinicians are urgently needed to improve work performance,
improve quality of care provided and prevent adverse events.

Work-related stress amongst doctors in intensive care, anaesthetics,
accident and emergency and general medicine

JI Tuthill, MS Ahmed, G Mathew, AC Bolton, AA Molokhia

University Hospital Lewisham, London, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P508 (doi: 10.1186/cc12446)

Introduction Work-related stress is a potential problem among
doctors and is associated with anxiety, depression, reduced job
satisfaction, days off work, errors and near misses [1]. To compare stress
levels between different groups of doctors and identify causes of stress,
we conducted a survey at University Hospital Lewisham using the UK
Health and Safety Executive’s Management Standards (HSEMS). HSEMS
is a validated tool developed to identify work conditions that warrant
interventions to reduce stress levels across organisations [2].

Methods We conducted an anonymous survey of doctors working
in anaesthetics, intensive care, general medicine and accident and
emergency (A&E) departments over 6 weeks using the HSEMS

questionnaire. We also surveyed awareness of the Trust’s stress
management services and whether staff had a designated supervisor
or mentor. Results were analysed using the HSEMS Analysis Tool, which
rates stressors with a score from 1 to 5 (5 represents the lowest amount
of stress). We compared the Trust’s results against HSEMS national
standards.
Results Seventy-two doctors completed the survey. Lowest stress
levels were found in doctors working in intensive care (n = 12, mean
3.63, SD 0.39). This was followed by medicine (n = 26, mean 3.55,
SD 0.47), anaesthetics (n = 27, mean 3.40, SD 0.44), and A&E (n = 7,
mean 3.11, SD 0.65), which had the highest stress levels. There was
no significant difference in stress levels between different grades of
doctors. When compared with HSEMS targets, staff relationships and
peer support exceeded national standards. However, management
of organisational change and demands at work need improvement.
The majority of doctors (82%) had no idea what stress management
services were provided by the Trust. Seventy-nine per cent of doctors
had an allocated supervisor or mentor, 91% of those felt able to
approach their supervisor.
Conclusion These survey results provide reassurance that stress levels
in intensive care compare well, despite critically unwell patients and
higher mortality rates. We identified areas that need improvement
within the Trust and will present these results to all relevant
departments. With the support of hospital management we will initiate
HSEMS-validated measures to reduce stress.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P509 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12447)

Introduction South-east London (SEL) presents unique challenges to
healthcare providers due to its diverse demographic. The high levels of
poverty, immigration and psychiatric illness impact delivery of obstetric
care. These were identified as risk factors for poor outcome in the latest
CMACE report [1]. The Intensive Care National Audit and Research
Centre (ICNARC) produced data on obstetric critical care admissions in
2007 [2]. We reviewed the obstetric critical care admissions in three SEL
hospitals and compared this with the national average determined in
the ICNARC and CMACE data.

Methods All critical care admissions in three high-risk obstetric units
in SEL (1 August 2009 to 31 July 2011) were screened for patients who
were currently or recently pregnant. We compared local results with
national data by ICNARC and CMACE.

Results There were 68 obstetric critical care admissions in the SEL
hospitals within the audited time frame. The mean age was 30.05 in
ICNARC data compared with 33.93 in SEL. Average APACHE II scores
were lower in SEL compared with the ICNARC data, but length of
stay was greater in SEL (2.72 days) compared with ICNARC (1.5 days).
Haemorrhage was the most common reason for admission in SEL,
whilst sepsis was the leading cause of death according to the latest
CMACE report (Figure 1).
Conclusion Data from national audits may guide protocol, but services
must be tailored to local circumstances. SEL has unique population
characteristics and obstetric critical care admissions differ significantly
from national statistics; in particular, haemorrhage is over-represented
in our region. Critical care services were generally required for a short
period of time; during this period, routine postpartum care may be
omitted as treatment priorities differ. Dedicated critical care services on
the labour ward may be a way to combine postnatal care with transient
high-dependency requirements. This may enhance patient experience
and prove cost-effective.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P510 (doi: 10.1186/cc12448)

Introduction Adverse drug events (ADEs) are associated with a
substantial increase in morbidity and mortality in any setting. Because
patients in ICUs were critically ill with complex diseases and varied
organ dysfunction, the incidence of ADEs on such patients is much
more crucial than the counterparts. We thus assessed the nature of
ADEs and their influence in ICUs.

Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study at ICUs at three
large tertiary-care hospitals in Japan. Trained research nurses reviewed
all medical charts, incident reports and reconciliations from the
pharmacy to identify suspected ADEs as well as the background of
patients. ADEs are any injuries that result from the use of a drug. After
suspected ADEs are collected by research nurses, physician reviewers
independently evaluated them and classified them as ADEs or rule
violations. We used the validated methodology [1].

Results We included 459 patients with 3,231 patient-days. The median
age was 70 years and the median length of stay was 3 days. In total, 70
patients (15%) had at least one ADE during their stay in the ICU. The
median ICU stay in patients who had ADEs was 14 days while 2 days
in patients who had no ADEs (P <0.0001). The median length of the
ADE onset days since admission was 3 days. Regarding the mortality,
73 patients (16%) were dead during their ICU stay: 12 deaths (17%) in
patients who had ADEs and three of 12 deaths were caused by an ADE,
and 61 deaths (16%) in counterparts (P = 0.8). There were no significant
differences of patients’ characteristics between patients with ADEs and
without ADEs (Table 1).

Conclusion ADEs were associated with longer stay and caused a part of
death in ICU (4%) although they did not increase the mortality. Because
the characteristics of patients were not associated with ADEs, early
detection and intervention for ADEs could be important to improve the
morbidity and reduce the death caused by ADEs in ICUs.

Attitude and knowledge of intensive care staff concerning donation
in Hungary: it is the first step to change

‘Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary, Hungarian National Blood
Transfusion Service, Budapest, Hungary

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P511 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12449)

Introduction In Hungary, despite the high level of social support, the
number of organ recoveries from deceased donors has not changed
significantly. The donation activity shows a positive relationship with
the level of education of staff in ICUs as well as with their attitude
towards transplantation. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to
estimate the attitude and knowledge of intensive care specialists and
nurses as regard donation and transplantation.

Methods The self-completed questionnaire that consisted of 20 items
was completed at the Congress of Hungarian Society of Anesthesiology
and Intensive Therapy in 2011. Besides the epidemiological data, the
intensive care specialists (n = 179) and nurses (n = 103) were asked
about donation activity, participation in an organ donation course, self-
reported knowledge of joining Eurotransplant, donor management,
legislation, and transplantation. The data were analyzed by SPSS 17.0.
Results A total of 53.6% of physicians and 16.7% of nurses attended
an earlier organ donation course (P <0.01). The average age of those
who participated in training was significantly higher among doctors
(P <0.01). Fifty-nine percent of doctors and 65.1% of nurses did not
even want to participate in such training. Donation activity was
higher among staff who joined training (P <0.01). Independently
from accepting the presumed consent legislation (91.1%), 66% of
physicians agreed with the hospital practice that requests the adult
donor's relatives to consent to organ recovery. This standpoint did
not depend on donation activity, participation in an organ donation
course, opinion about legislation and the nature of staff. A total
95.4% of participants consented to their organ retrieval after death.
The staff who participated in an organ donation course had more

$189

knowledge regarding the law and ethics of donation (P <0.01), donor
management (P <0.01), living and deceased donor transplantation
(P <0.01) and joining Eurotransplant (P <0.01). Older professionals had
more information about all fields (P <0.01). Nurses had less knowledge
concerning donor management (P <0.01), law and ethics (P <0.01) and
deceased donor transplantation (P <0.01) than doctors.

Conclusion Education about organ donation needs to be part of
specialist training of intensive care staff, and refresher courses every
fifth year as well. The course should include knowledge regarding brain
death, donor management and communication with family. This is the
first step to improve the number of transplantations.

Specialist nurse for organ donation in an emergency department
will increase organ donation

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P512 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12450)

Introduction In the UK, three people die each day awaiting transplan-
tation, due to the unavailability of donor organs. Traditionally, donor
identification has been restricted to the ICU. However, following the UK
Organ Donation Taskforce report in 2008 [1], a number of emergency
departments (EDs) have been working with specialist nurses for organ
donation (SN:OD) to identify potential donors and approach their
families for consent in the ED. We present our initial experience after
the introduction of a SN:OD to an Irish teaching hospital’s ED.
Methods We conducted a retrospective review of deaths in our
ED during a 28-month period. For those who died in the ED, case
notes were reviewed to identify those suitable for organ donation.
Referral and donation rates were compared in two cohorts, pre and
post introduction of a SN:OD. Fisher's exact test was used to assess
differences between groups.
Results Ninety-one deaths occurred in the study period. Following
introduction of the SN:OD, referrals increased from zero to eight. Of
the eight referred, three received consent and were transferred to the
ICU, two of whom became successful donors. The number of missed
potential donors fell from six to one (P = 0.009).
Conclusion Introduction of a SN:OD and a clinical pathway has led to
the identification of previously missed potential organ donors in the
ED. Several patients have subsequently been admitted to critical care
solely to facilitate organ donation.

Introduction Our objective was to analyze septic HIV patients admitted
to intensive care.

Methods A retrospective study of HIV patients admitted to our ICU
between January 2005 and December 2009. We identify patients
admitted to the ICU with sepsis and analyze demographic factors,
etiology, organ failure and outcome, and we compare immune status,
frequency of organ failure and outcome between these patients and
those admitted for other reasons. We use Student's t test to compare
quantitative variables, and the chi-square test for qualitative data.
Results A total of 104 HIV patients were admitted to our ICU during
the study period, 62 with sepsis (71% men, mean age: 40.59 + 8.12).
Of sepsis patients, 56.5% were admitted from the ER and 38.7% from
a medical ward; 66.1% had history of intravenous drugs use, other
comorbidities: COPD (9.7%), cirrhosis (8.1%), solid or hematologic
malignancy (12.9%); 8.1% patients were unaware of their condition

(2.4% in non-infected patients, P= 0.223) and 40.3% were under HAART
(64.3% in patients admitted without infection, P = 0.016). Mean CD4
count at admission: 219.62 + 353.93 cells/mm? (vs. 370.22 + 362.56,
P =0.048). Mean viral load: 4.57 + 3.25 log (vs. 2.257 + 1.96, P= 0.001).
Of sepsis patients, 62.1% were on their CD4 nadir (vs. 34.5% in
nonseptic patients, P = 0.009). Mean albumin levels were 2.3 + 0.53 g/
dl (vs. 2.92 + 0.94, P <0.001). APACHE II at admission was 21.98 + 7.97
(vs. 18.15 + 8.47, P= 0.046). At admission, 52.8% were on severe sepsis
and 44.3% on septic shock. The lung was the most frequent source of
infection (65.6%) followed by CNS (16.4%), UTI (4.9%) and IE (4.9%). The
most common pathogen isolated on these patients was S. pneumoniae
(28.8%), followed by P. jirovecii (13.6%), toxoplasma (8.5%), E. coli (5.1%)
and H. influenzae (5.1%). In total, 62.9% needed vasopressors (vs. 28.6%
in non-infected patients, P = 0.001), 79% mechanical ventilation (vs.
42.85%, P <0.001) and 19.4% renal replacement (9.5% in no septic
patients, P = 0.173). Mean ICU and hospital LOS was 10.43 + 10.52 and
34.76 + 29.64 days in septic patients versus 6.04 + 8.45 (P = 0.026) and
20.54 + 27.93 days (P = 0.016). ICU mortality: 33.9% (19% in nonseptic
patients, P = 0.098), hospital mortality: 41.9% (vs. 23.8%, P = 0.057).
Conclusion Sepsis is a common reason for admission to the ICU in
HIV patients and is accompanied by high mortality. Pheumonia is the
most frequent source of infection. Septic patients are less frequently
under HAART and have a worse inmune status (lower CD4 count
and higher viral load). Despite a higher APACHE II, and a higher need
for hemodynamic and respiratory support, there is no statistically
significant difference in ICU and hospital mortality between septic and
nonseptic patients.

Mortality related to respiratory failure among pediatric hematology
patients requiring intensive care

Introduction Although recent reports show an improvement in out-
comes for pediatric hematology patients requiring intensive care [1,2],
respiratory failure remains one of the major risks of pediatric mortality.
This study was conducted to assess our hypothesis that mortality
associated with respiratory failure is higher than that for other organ
failures in pediatric hematology patients admitted to our ICU.
Methods A retrospective study analyzed children with hematological
disorders admitted to our ICU between April 2005 and June 2012. All
of the included children required emergency admission and invasive
mechanical ventilation. Those who did not need intubation, or required
intubation only for therapeutic intervention and died within 24 hours
of ICU admission were excluded. The survival group was defined as
patients who were discharged from the ICU, and the nonsurvival
group was defined as those who died in the ICU or within 7 days after
discharge from the ICU. The PELOD score and PIM-II were applied as
morbidity scoring systems

Results Twenty-seven patients, including 18 males and nine females,
with a median age of 6.1 years (range, 0.2 to 16.6 years) were analyzed.
Sixteen patients had leukemia, five had hemophagocytic syndrome,
six had solid tumors. The average predicted mortality rate was 31.3%
in PIM-Il. The survival group included 15 patients (56%) and the
nonsurvival group included 12 patients (44%). When the survival group
was compared with the nonsurvival group, there were no significant
differences in the systolic blood pressure (101.3 + 13.9 mmHg vs.
92.8 + 25.4 mmHg; P = 0.15), the proportion of patients requiring
continuous renal replacement therapy (33.3% vs. 50.0%; P = 0.30), and
PELOD score (15.5 + 10.4 vs. 21.8 + 15.4; P = 0.22). In the nonsurvival
group, the PIM-II was higher than that in the survival group (27.9 + 10.4
vs. 35.7 + 9.0; P = 0.06); the PaO,/FIO, (272.5 + 136.7 vs. 153.3 + 123.3;
P =0.03) and oxygenation index (6.7 + 8.1 vs. 14.1 + 9.5; P= 0.04) were
significantly worse in the nonsurvival group than in the survival group.
Conclusion The data show that respiratory failure is more strongly
associated with mortality than other organ failures in pediatric
hematology patients requiring intensive care. These results also suggest
that mechanical ventilation intervention in patients with respiratory
failure must occur earlier to improve the outcomes for these patients.

Introduction Critically ill patients with haematological malignancies
(HM) have high hospital mortality [1]. Severity of illness scores may
underestimate mortality in such patients [2].

Methods Data collection was conducted at three hospitals from 2008
to 2011. Patients with any active HM condition were matched with
two control patients at two hospitals and with one control at Christie
Hospital. Control patients had the same APACHE II (within 2 points) and
admission diagnosis, but no HM. Readmissions and planned surgical
cases were excluded.

Results A total of 163 patients with HM were compared with 237
control patients. Seventy-four admissions with HM were identified at
two hospitals, and each was matched with two control patients. Eighty-
nine admissions with HM from Christie Hospital were identified. These
were matched with 89 controls. Patients with HM spent significantly
longer in hospital before ICU admission (Table 1). Unit and hospital
mortality rates were not statistically different between patients with
HM and without HM (Table 2).

Conclusion Unit mortality of critically ill patients with HM was similar
to those without HM. Hospital mortality in patients with HM was higher
than those without HM, although not statistically significant. Severity
of illness at presentation to critical care is the main determinant of
outcome in patients with HM.

group when requiring emergency admission to the ICU in a tertiary

cancer centre.

Methods A retrospective review of medical notes between 2004 and

2012.

Results A total of 249 patients were admitted, of whom 54 had more

than one admission. There were 310 episodes in total. Leukaemia n= 85;

lymphoma n = 90; myeloma n = 36. We compared the characteristics of

those who survived ICU admission with those who failed to survive to

discharge from ICU. The two populations were similar (age 51 vs. 57;

males 59% vs. 57%). Those who survived had a lower APACHE II score

on admission (19 vs. 23; P <0.001), lower mean organ failure scores (1

vs. 2; P <0.05), lower requirements of inotropes (26% vs. 50%; P = 0.001),

ventilation (31% vs. 64%; P = 0.001) and filtration (11% vs. 26%;

P = 0.004). There was no difference in the prevalence of sepsis at the

time of admission (64% vs. 70%). Both groups included patients with

prior bone marrow transplant (38% vs. 40%). Of note, ICU and 6-month
survival were 27% and 50%, respectively. These values are lower than
those reported in the literature to date.

Conclusion ICU and 6-month mortalities were 27% and 50%, respectively.

Patients with haematological malignancy stand to benefit from intensive

care, and should be offered admission based on clinical need.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P517 (doi: 10.1186/cc12455)

Introduction In the year 2009, the organizational structure of the ICU
in the Kanazawa University Hospital changed from an open to a semi-
closed format ICU. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect
of this organizational change on outcome in high-risk surgical patients.
Methods The medical records of all consecutive high-risk surgical
patients admitted to the ICU from 2006 to 2009 (open format, n= 1,598)
and from 2009 to 2012 (semi-closed format, n = 1,521) were reviewed.
Parameters studied were mortality and ICU length of stay.

Results Mortality of ICU patients was 9.9% in the open format group
and 6.6% in the closed format group (P <0.05). The average length of
hospital stay was 4.9 days in the open format group and 4.8 days in the
closed format group.

Conclusion Our results suggest that a semi-closed format is a more
favorable setting than an open format to improve mortality in the ICU
and to warrant safe outcome in this patient group.

Methods Our e-prescribing software enables users to prescribe
intravenous fluids from a series of menus. One of these is a template
that has several fluids available to use as a bolus when instructed by
a clinician. We removed starch as an option from the template in April
2009. Starch could still be prescribed elsewhere on the prescribing
system. Data on the use of starch from November 2008 to November
2012 were analysed as the mean volume of starch infused per patient
per month. The mean of each set of parameters was then compared
using a Student's t test.

Results The mean volume of starch per patient administered before
and after electronic prescription options were altered was 480 ml and
21 ml, respectively (P = 0.004). See Figure 1.

Conclusion Despite clinicians intending to reduce the use of starch it
was still regularly administered on our ICU. The removal of a default
prescribing option dramatically reduced the volume of starch used
whilst not restricting the ability to make a conscious choice to prescribe
it. Adjusting default options has potential to influence clinical decisions
and ensure more reliable, evidence-based care.

Introduction Early detection of sepsis is important for a sufficient
treatment to reduce mortality. We hypothesized that using modified
systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria over 1 hour using an
electronic software program facilitates the clinical diagnosis of sepsis.
Methods After IRB approval and informed consent we enrolled in this
prospective, observational, single-center study 1,119 consecutive
patients (age 68.6 + 16.4, female/male 476/649) admitted over a
6-month period to a surgical ICU. A total 149 of them met modified
systemic inflammatory response criteria. Patients were monitored by
an electronic software program using live data from the laboratory and
bedside monitors to detect modified systemic inflammatory response
syndrome criteria persisting over 1 hour. The physicians were blinded
to the software program alerts that notified in real time when modified
systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria were detected and
persisted over 1 hour, but did not provide treatment recommendations.
Results There was a total of 149 modified systemic inflammatory
response syndrome criteria alerts. Seventy-four were confirmed as
true sepsis cases by physicians. The overall incidence of sepsis was 7%.
Patients were categorized into length of stay <24 hours, 24 to 96 hours
and >96 hours. The overall sensitivity of our system for detecting sepsis
was 68% and the specificity was 91%. The positive predictive value is
34% and the negative predictive value is 98%.

Conclusion Real-time alerts using an automated, electronic monitoring
of modified systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria facili-
tate the clinical diagnosis of sepsis.

Victoria Infirmary, Glasgow, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P520 (doi: 10.1186/cc12458)

Introduction Admission to hospital overnight has been shown
to increase mortality and decrease hospital length of stay [1]. The
objective of this study was to determine whether this relationship is
valid in patients admitted to our ICU, and whether length of stay was
affected.

Methods A retrospective data collection identified 5,827 patients
admitted to a five-bed ICU from April 1994 to November 2012. Data
regarding patient age, sex, APACHE II score and ICU admission date
and time were collected along with the length of stay in the unit and
hospital. Definitions of day and night were set to local ICU standards of
9:00 am to 8:00 pm. Patients were then separated into two groups and
analysed using Analyse-It software for Excel.

Results Crude ICU and hospital mortality rates in patients admitted
during the day and overnight were examined. There was no significant
difference in unit mortality (day 22.3% vs. night 22.7%, OR = 1.02, 95%
Cl = 0.91 to 1.16, P= 0.718) or hospital mortality (day 30.7% vs. night
29.1%, OR = 0.93, 95% Cl = 0.83 to 1.04, P= 0.203). The mean unit length
of stay showed no difference in patients admitted during daytime
compared with those admitted overnight (4.27 days vs. 4.09 days,
P = 0.162). The mean hospital length of stay was decreased in patients
admitted during daytime compared with patients admitted overnight
(19.3 days vs. 21.7 days, P = 0.004). The average age of patients was
less in those admitted out of hours (night 56.5 years vs. day 59.2 years,
P = <.0001). There was no significant difference in APACHE II scores of
patients between the groups (day 19 vs. night 19, P = 0.580).
Conclusion There is no significant difference between the mortality of
patients admitted overnight and patients admitted during the day to
our unit. The hospital length of stay is increased in patients who are
admitted overnight to intensive care; however, ICU length of stay is
not affected. Adjustment for other confounders such as current bed
occupancy and staffing ratios during the entire patient stay may help
to understand the differences seen in the hospital length of stay.

Assessing the quality of interdisciplinary rounds

EC Ten Have, JE Tulleken

Universitair Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands
Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P521 (doi: 10.1186/cc12459)

Introduction Interdisciplinary rounds (IDRs) in the ICU are increasingly
recommended to support quality improvement and to reduce
conflicts, but uncertainty exists about assessing the quality of IDRs.
We developed, tested, and applied a scoring instrument to assess the
quality of IDRs in ICUs.

Methods A literature search was performed to identify criteria for
instruments about assessing team processes in the ICU. Then, 10
videotaped patient presentations led by different intensivists were
analyzed by Delphi rounds. Appropriate and inappropriate behaviors
were highlighted. The IDR-Assessment Scale was developed and
statistically tested. The inter-rater reliability was evaluated by
rating nine randomly selected videotaped patient presentations by
three raters. Finally, the scale was applied to 98 videotaped patient
presentations during 22 IDRs in three ICUs for adults in two hospitals
in Groningen.

Results The IDR-Assessment Scale had 19 quality indicators,
subdivided into two domains: Patient Plan of Care, and Process. The
domain Patient Plan of Care reflects the technical performance from
the initial identification of a goal to the evaluative phase. The domain
Process reflects the team processes that are important to ensure that
the appropriate plan of care is agreed, understood, and executed as
planned by all care providers. Indicators were essential or supportive.
The inter-rater reliability of nine videotaped patient presentations
among three raters was satisfactory (kK = 0.85). The overall item

$192

score correlations between three raters were excellent (r = 0.80 to
0.94). Internal consistency in 98 videotaped patient presentations
was acceptable (a = 0.78). Application to 22 IDRs led by 14 different
intensivists in three ICUs in two hospitals demonstrated that indicators
could be unambiguously rated. The staff and management of all three
ICUs that were rated had considered their IDRs to be adequately
performed, and they were surprised by these study results.
Conclusion This study showed that the quality of IDRs can be reliably
assessed for patient plan of care and process. The IDR-Assessment
Scale had satisfactory inter-rater reliability, excellent overall item score
correlations, and acceptable internal consistency. Our instrument
may provide feedback for ICU professionals and managers to develop
adjustments in quality of care. Testing the IDR-Assessment Scale in
other ICUs may be required to establish general applicability.

Leadership training and quality improvement of interdisciplinary
rounds in the ICU

EC Ten Have, JE Tulleken

Universitair Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P522 (doi: 10.1186/cc12460)

Introduction The development of patient-centered care by inter-
disciplinary teams in the ICU has focused attention on leadership
behavior. The purpose of this intervention study was to measure
the effect of leadership training on the quality of performed inter-
disciplinary rounds (IDRs) in the ICU.
Methods In this nonrandomized intervention study, participants
included nine intensive care medicine fellow trainees (intervention
group) and 10 experienced intensivists (control group). Participants
in the intervention and control groups previously were untrained in
leading IDRs in the ICUs. After each participant led an IDR that was
videotaped, the fellow trainees participated in a 1-day leadership
training, which was consistent with principles of adult learning and
behavioral modeling. After training, each fellow trainee led another
IDR that was videotaped. Quality of the performed IDRs was measured
by review of videotapes of the 19 IDRs lead by 19 intensivists, including
198 patient discussions subdivided into four ICUs, and assessment with
the IDR-Assessment Scale.
Results Comparison of the intervention versus control groups shows
that the intervention group has more yes scores on the IDR-Assessment
Scale than the control group. This difference was significant in 12 of the,
in total, 19 quality indicators.
Conclusion Quality of leadership will be reliably trained and measured
in the context of IDRs in ICUs. Training in a simulation environment, with
real-life IDR scenarios including conflicting situations, and workplace-
based feedback in the preparation and feedback phases, appears to be
effective to train leadership behaviour.

beds. Intentional rounds or proactive patient rounds were recognised
by the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Nursing [1]
as structured, evidence-based processes for nurses to carry out regular
checks with individual patients at set intervals. The senior nursing team
decided to adapt this initiative to the intensive care setting in order
to address clinical challenges and provide guidance for shift leaders to
focus on key elements of care.
Methods Our intentional rounds, performed once per shift (twice daily),
include two components. First, pressure area care — this component
involves the shift leader checking whether key elements of pressure
sore prevention have been performed. These include completion
of the Waterlow risk assessment tool [2], noting the frequency of
repositioning, use of lateral positioning and pressure-relieving pads.
Second, renal replacement therapy rates - this element was identified
as an area for focus after we established that our haemofiltration fluid
use per hour of therapy was twice that of a near identical clinical setting.
This pattern continued even after adopting similar therapy guidelines.
The shift leader was guided to check whether therapy rates had been
adjusted in line with latest biochemical results.
Results The incidence of pressure ulcers in the 4 months since the
initiative began has averaged 2.25 per month compared with 7.8 per
month prior to commencement of intentional rounding. Added to the
rounding tool at the end of September 2012, RRT rates in the preceding
4 months averaged 31.5 ml/kg/hour over 24 hours, an 11.9% reduction
from the previous average of 35.75 ml/kg/hour. If the pattern of RRT
was to continue, this could equate to a cost saving of UK£40,000 per
annum.
Conclusion The use of a modified targeted intentional rounding tool
by the nursing shift leader can help ensure that best practice guidelines
are adhered to. This strategy can improve patient outcomes and
provide potentially significant fiscal benefits.

Introduction Handovers are often associated with poor communica-
tion. ICU patients with multiple complex problems are ideal to study
naturally occurring handovers. However, few studies have been
conducted in the ICU.

Methods We conducted questionnaires of physicians and nurses
involved and observed handovers in real time of medical ICU patients
over 1 month.

Results We interviewed 580 of 672 physicians and nurses involved
(86.3%) and observed 90 real-time handovers (45 patients, 26.8%) of
168 patients. Mean duration of handover was 391.3 (+ 263.6) seconds,
78.5% were face to face and 1.26 (+ 1.75) distractions per handover
were noted, person-to-person calling being the commonest mode
of distraction (46.7%). Nurses received training during induction
in significantly higher numbers, covered allied specialties more
and reviewed the patients early (all P <0.05). Perception of the
relative importance of different components of the handover varied
significantly between donors, recipients, physicians and nurses. Both
physicians and nurses seldom (39.7%) reviewed the available electronic
past medical records of the patient before handover, which in addition
to training in handover and overall confidence level in the management
following handover are significantly associated with better satisfaction
in univariate analysis; only the confidence level in patient management
remained significant after multivariate analysis. However, agreement
between donor and recipient on overall satisfaction was poor
(P >0.05). Nursing handovers were significantly longer than physicians’

$193

(572.08 + 214.68 vs. 168.6 + 97.27 seconds, P <0.001) but are also
associated with higher distractions particularly during evening shifts.
Conclusion A higher percentage of nurses received handover training;
nursing handovers are longer and more inclusive of other components
of patient management; perceived importance of components of
handover varies among healthcare professionals; distractions are
common during handovers and associated with longer duration,
by nurses and in the evening shifts; and higher confidence level in
patient's management following the handover is associated with
better satisfaction.

Introduction Emergency survival rates vary significantly according
to the quality of care, which depends on human and technological
resources. Emergency and critical care medicine physicians must make
fast decisions; the presence of experienced consultants improves
survival. In developing countries, there is a shortage of skilled
doctors. The aim is to describe the first Brazilian initiative of real-
time teleconferencing telemedicine (TM) providing 24/7 emergency
department (ED) and ICU coverage.

Methods Since May 2012 a TM program has been implemented at
two hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil — Hospital Municipal Dr. Moysés
Deutsch (HMMD), a public, secondary hospital, and Hospital Israelita
Albert Einstein (HIAE), a tertiary private philanthropic entity - due to
a partnership with the Brazilian Health Ministry. TM Central Command
was located at HIAE with Endpoint 97 MXP Cisco® Solution and a
mobile Intern MXP ISDN/IP Cisco® for the remote hospital (HMMD) via
dedicated GB/sec connection. Imaging examinations were evaluated
using PACS technology. Every recruited patient was assessed by the
Central Command through TM with an experienced consultant.
Results Over a 6-month period, 131 teleconsultations (114 patients)
were done. Mean age was 50.1 years, 57.1% was male and mean
APACHE II score was 24.3. A total of 64.8% originated from the ICU and
35.2% from the ED. Main consultation diagnoses were sepsis (31.3%);
stroke (29.8%); survival from cardiac arrest (6.1%); trauma (6.1%); and
acute myocardial infarction (5.3%). TM improved diagnosis in 14.5%
and influenced the clinical management in 85.5% of the consultations.
Invasive procedures were indicated in 61.1%. Life-saving procedures
were TM related in seven patients (6.1%): stroke thrombolysis (n = 6)
and limb amputation (n= 1). Seven patients (6.1%) were transferred and
submitted to surgical procedures (heart surgery (n = 2), neurosurgery
(n = 4) and liver transplantation (n = 1)). The majority of the patients
remained at HMMD and were discharged.

Conclusion ATM program is feasible to be implemented in a community
hospital. The major benefit is expertise medical transfer from the
tertiary hospital to the community setting, improving diagnosis and
management of critical care patients, and avoiding routine transfer to
a major urban center.

using telemedicine to provide acute burn and critical care consultation
on pediatric and adult burn patients in Lviv, Ukraine, as well as in triage
and transport of critically ill patients from Lviv to a tertiary-care facility
in the USA for further management.

Methods Using a new telemedicine learning center established at City
Hospital #8 in Lviv, Ukraine, consultations regarding acutely injured
burn victims occurred between physicians in Ukraine and physicians at
Shriners Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. After
the initial presentation, each patient was reviewed on a daily basis by
physicians in Boston. Skype, an Internet-based communication tool,
was used in communication with the Burn Center in Lviv. Radiographic
images were scanned and digitalized using an electronic scanner,
and JPEG image compression was used to facilitate the transmission
of radiographic images and patient charts. Informed consent and
HIPPA guidelines were followed in transmitting any patient-related
information.

Results Since 2011 we have provided consultation on 14 patients in
Lviv, Ukraine, ranging in age from 15 months to 63 years. Each patient
had an average of six consultations. We present two of these cases as
examples of the capabilities of our telemedicine program. The first
case involved a 15-month-old female with 40% TBSA from scald injury,
where telemedicine was instrumental in the primary assessment as
well as to arrange a direct assessment from a nearby burn surgeon. The
second case resulted from a house fire with multiple casualties, where
physicians in Boston were able to utilize telemedicine to guide the
initial resuscitation and airway management of three critically burned
children, as well as to arrange for transport of one of the victims, an
11-year-old male with 87% TBSA, from Ukraine to the USA for acute
management. Multiple difficulties were overcome in implementing the
system between the two countries including: time zone differences,
language barrier, and different approaches to patient care.

Conclusion We have established a telemedicine program linking
physicians in Boston, MA, USA with City Hospital #8 in Lviv, Ukraine
to improve care in pediatric and adult burn patients. Our program has
provided consultation on 14 patients since 2011, and it highlights the
capabilities of telemedicine for acute consultation as well as triage and
transport of critically ill patients to tertiary-care facilities.

Introduction During the last few years the frequency of end-of-
life decisions (EOLD) significantly increased in ICUs. The method of
nurse involvement in making EOLD is different worldwide [1,2]. The
purpose of this study was to analyze opinions of nurses about therapy
restriction. We have examined with a multicenter study the opinions of
the medical stuff about end-of-life care in Hungarian ICUs.

Methods We performed a questionnaire evaluation among physicians
and nurses of ICUs about influencing factors of therapy restriction, the
method of the decision-making process, and the frequency of different
EOLD. The questionnaire, containing 21 questions, was delivered
electronically to Hungarian ICUs, and then we analyzed the responses
anonymously. The retrieved 302 answers (191 physicians, 102 nurses)
were analysed using a nonparametric Student's test.

Results A total 71% of the nurse responders work in university clinics,
2% in regional centrum, 24% in municipal hospital, 3% in other ICUs.
The nurses found both human (2.72/5 vs. 1.98/5) and material (2.81/5
vs. 2.12/5) resources more restrictive factors during patient admission
than physicians (P = 0.025, P = 0.0024). Nurses working in municipal
hospital were more strongly influenced by lack of material and human
resources (3.34/5, 3.3/5) than nurses working in university clinics (2.2/5,
2.43/5), P = 0.01, P = 0.025. Younger nurses (working between 6 and
10 years) were more interested in the patient’s or surrogate’s wishes
than older nurses (working more than 10 years). Religion did not
influence patient admission and forego therapy; however, religious
nurses compared with atheists and nonpracticing believers preferred
to prolong therapy against the patient's will (P = 0.04). Nurses felt that

S194

physicians slightly involved them in the end-of-life decision-making

process (2.1/5 vs. 2.4/5 P= 0.0001).

Conclusion We found that the workplace, level of medical attendance,

godliness, work experience, and position in medical staff strongly

influenced making EOLD. While limitation of the therapy should

be team work, nurses felt their opinions were hardly taken into

consideration, although nurses seemed to be more realistic in the

decision-making process.

Introduction More than one in five people admitted to an ICU will die
there. Research has highlighted concerns about support for patients
and families and decision-making in this context [1,2]. Here, we describe
the development and evaluation of a tool to improve palliative care ina
32-bed general ICU in a central London teaching hospital.
Methods Medical Research Council guidance for complex interventions
Phase 0 to | comprised literature review, theoretical modelling, obser-
vation and qualitative interviews and focus groups with staff and
families exploring concerns and views of interventions identified in
the literature review. Phase II comprised intervention development,
implementation and evaluation of tool feasibility and effects using staff
survey, observation, audit of records and relative survey.
Results Phase |: 47 staff and 24 family members were interviewed.
The short time between decisions for treatment withdrawal and
death, plus concerns for support management, communication and
decision-making, highlighted a need to ensure excellent psychosocial
assessment for all. Phase Il: as part of integrated care guidelines, we
developed the King’s Psychosocial Assessment and Care tool (K-PACE).
K-PACE is used for all patients entering the ICU, completed within
24 hours of admission. It contains psychosocial assessment of the
family and patient needs, and identifies key individuals for contact.
Educational training was supported by K-PACE and was implemented
in two waves. Post-implementation survey of 95 ICU staff found that
most (80%) were aware of K-PACE. Eighty-two per cent of nurses but
only 17% of doctors had completed the tool. In total, 158/213 (74%)
family members responded to the survey (additionally three patients
responded). There were high levels of satisfaction for symptom control
and psychosocial care but concerns continued regarding explanation
of treatment and care.
Conclusion K-PACE is a feasible tool to improve the palliative care of
patients and their families in the ICU. Further refinement is needed and
planned, with consideration of roll-out into the wider medical centre.

Introduction The decision of terminal care in the ICU is a very
tough issue because the law, ethics, traditions and futility should

----$$$$----$$$$----

be concerned involving the family’s will. Especially, stopping or
withdrawing therapy is a quite difficult operation in Japan because of
legal issues. Our hypothesis is that some difference exists in thoughts
between physicians and nurses for terminal patients in the ICU. The aim
of this study is to know their real thoughts.

Methods A questionnaire survey was performed on physicians and
nurses in our medico-surgical ICU. The questionnaire consists of
11 questions with five optional answers related to the thoughts of
participants about treatment of hopeless or brain death patients.
Concretely, the questions were; whether to withhold therapy or not,
whether to accept to withdraw therapy or not and with family’s will,
whether to accept to immediately stop therapy and with family’s will,
whether to positively or not donate organs from a brain death patient,
necessity of ICU care for brain death patients, and feeling guilty and
stress for stopping or withdrawing therapy. The optional answer has
five gradations from ‘Yes’ to ‘No’ for all questions. The participants were
asked to answer the questionnaire by expressing themselves without
regarding legal issues or the consensus. It was guaranteed to be
anonymous for them in the data analysis. The answers were compared
between physicians and nurses. The Mann-Whitney U test was used
for statistical analysis. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results There were in total 52 participants (response rate 98.1%) with
20 physicians and 32 nurses. Withdrawing therapy was significantly
accepted in nurses than in physicians (83% vs. 55%, P= 0.039), when the
family well understood. Withholding therapy should not be operated
for brain death patients for physicians (65%), while it seemed a difficult
judgement for nurses (23%, P = 0.021). ICU care for brain death patients
is less necessary for physicians than nurses (80% vs. 53%, P = 0.016).
There were no significant differences in other questions between
physician and nurses such as feeling guilty or stress for stopping or
withdrawing therapy.

Conclusion Some of end-of-life thoughts in the ICU showed differences
between physicians and nurses.

Introduction The purpose of our study was to assess the attitudes of
Slovenian intensivists towards end-of-life (EOL) decision-making and to
analyze the decision-making process in their clinical practice.
Methods A cross-sectional survey among Slovenian intensivists and
intensive care medicine residents from 35 different ICUs was performed
using a questionnaire containing 43 questions about views on EOL
decision-making. Fisher's exact test and the Fisher-Freeman-—Halton
test were applied to cross-tabulated data; significance level was set at P
<0.001 due to the large number of tested hypotheses.

Results The response rate was 72.1% (267 questionnaires were
returned out of 370 distributed), which represented roughly the same
percentage of all Slovenian intensivists. Termination of futile treatment
was assessed as ethically acceptable (P <0.001). The statement that
there is no ethical distinction between withholding and withdrawing
of treatment could not be confirmed (the answers ‘there is a difference’
and ‘undecided’ were less frequent, but not statistically significant;
P=0.216). A do-not-resuscitate order (DNR) was used more often than
other withholding treatment limitations (P <0.001). A DNR was used
most frequently in internal medicine ICUs (P <0.001; compared with
paediatric and surgical ICUs). Withdrawal of inotropes or antibiotics
was used more often than withdrawal of mechanical ventilation or
extubation (66.7% vs. 12.0%; P <0.001). Withdrawal of mechanical
ventilation or extubation was more often used in the paediatric ICUs
(21.7%) as compared with the internal medicine ICUs (19.6%) and the
surgical ICUs (3%) (P <0.001). Over two-thirds (70.6%) of intensivists
were against termination of hydration, which would be more often
used in the internal medicine ICUs (P <0.001). Thirty-one percent of
intensivists used written DNR orders.

Conclusion Termination of futile treatment was found to be ethically
acceptable for Slovenian intensivists, although they were not convinced

$195

that withholding and withdrawing of treatment were ethically equal. A
DNR would be used most often. Withdrawal of inotropes or antibiotics
would be used more often than withdrawal of mechanical ventilation
or extubation. Termination of artificial hydration would be rarely used
in practice.

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P531 (doi: 10.1186/cc12469)

Introduction We aimed to determine the current practice and
attitudes of consultants in intensive care medicine when withdrawing
futile life-sustaining therapy. Published guidelines suggest variation
in withdrawal of futile life-sustaining therapy and are therefore not
prescriptive [1]. Although there is an awareness of differing practices,
the extent of these variations is not established.
Methods We surveyed a convenience sample of delegates at the
Intensive Care Society (UK) State of the Art Meeting (2012) on attitudes
and practice regarding withdrawal practice. Anonymised data were
collected using surveymonkey.com.
Results Of 457 consultant attendees from the UK, 149 completed the
survey (33%). For 58% of consultants there was no formal institutional
protocol for withdrawal of futile therapy. When deciding to withdraw
therapy, 57% of consultants routinely seek and document a second
opinion. Regarding donation after cardiac death (DCD), 93% of
consultants were happy to delay withdrawal to facilitate successful
donation, 85% have already done so in their practice and 14%
routinely withdraw therapy in theatres rather than on the ICU. Even
if it would impact on the care of other patients, 48% would delay
withdrawal of therapy to facilitate DCD. For patients accepted for
DCD, 36% think that some intensivists withdraw more aggressively
(in essence, hasten death) in the hope of improving the likelihood of a
successful organ donation and 29% have felt pressurised to withdraw
therapy more quickly than their usual practice. Furthermore, 45%
experienced pressure to refer a patient for DCD when it they felt it
was not appropriate.
Conclusion This survey confirms variation in the practice and attitudes
to withdrawal of futile therapy amongst UK consultant intensivists.
Formal protocols were frequently unavailable to guide withdrawal
and second opinions were often not sought. Nearly one-half of the
intensivists delay withdrawal to facilitate donation, even if this may
impact on the care of other patients. Many intensivists have felt
pressure to refer for donation when they feel this is inappropriate
and there is a perception that some intensivists may withdraw care
more aggressively in those who are accepted for DCD to improve the
likelihood of a successful donation. This survey may help inform debate
in this ethically challenging area.

Methods An exploratory-descriptive study with a qualitative approach
in the PICU of Hospital Sao Lucas and Hospital de Clinicas de Porto
Alegre involving 15 parents of children who died. Data collection was
performed through three steps: (a) the researchers contacted the
parents through a telephone call to invite them to attend the hospitals;
(b) at the hospital, the doctors who assisted the children clarified doubts
about the therapy offered; and (c) an interview was carried out by two
researchers not involved in the care. Data analysis was performed using
the technique of thematic content analysis.

Getting critical care patients home for end-of-life care
LS Nielsen

Kolding Sygehus, Kolding, Denmark

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P533 (doi: 10.1186/cc12471)

Introduction Despite our efforts in making patients healthy and going
home, critical illness has a mortality, in Danish ICUs, of 10 to 12%.
Approximately 90% of deaths in ICUs happen after life-sustaining
therapy has been withheld or withdrawn. Although trying to provide
patients and family with what we suppose is a good death, most
patients would prefer dying at home, and sometimes patients and
family ask for the possibility of doing that. The last 2 years we transferred
seven patients from our unit to end-of-life care in their own home.
Methods After making the decision of withholding or withdrawing
intensive care therapy, the care of the patient changes from an active,
medical, technological treatment to relief and care. In that period we
determine whether the patient’s condition is stable enough to go
home. We try to find out if it is a wish for the patient to go home, and
if the family has resources to take care of the patient at home. If that is
the case, we start planning care at home, arrange for transportation,
and contact the primary care physician and nurse. Due to the patient's
condition on the day of transferring, we plan following the patient by
either a nurse or a doctor.
Results Seven terminally ill patients wishing to go home for dying were
transferred home. Diagnoses varied: end-stage lung disease, cancer,
surgical complications. Ages ranged from 68 to 84 years. All patients
survived transport home, and time at home varied from a few hours to
4 days. Later contacts with patients’ families indicated that both patient
and family were grateful, and that they did not experience the patient
having pain or dyspnea at home.
Conclusion Sending critically ill patients home to die is not common.
Anyhow, our experiences doing that are only positive. Terminally ill
patients, awake to make a decision of their own, and in a condition
making it possible, should have the choice to go home to die, with our
help in logistics, planning and transportation.

Introduction This study assessed the effect of a hospital-based aerobic
exercise programme on physical fitness and health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) for survivors of ICU admission. Including the qualitative

S196

arm of the study, we examined the patient experience after critical
illness, their views of the exercise programme and the effects on their
HRQOL.

Methods A randomised controlled trial was undertaken in adult
survivors of ICU admission. They were allocated to receive an
8-week in-hospital supervised aerobic programme consisting of two
cycle ergometry and one unsupervised session per week (exercise
group) or no exercise (control group). Primary outcomes were the
anaerobic threshold (in ml O,/kg mass/minute), physical function
and mental health scores (SF-36 questionnaire), measured at weeks
9 and 26. Participants were then allocated to focus groups where the
interpretation of experiences was compared with outcomes from the
PIX study.

Results Fifty-nine patients were recruited to the study. The anaerobic
threshold increased at week 9 in the exercise group by a clinically and
statistically significant amount of 2 ml O,/kg mass/minute (90% Cl, 1
to 3 ml/kg/minute). There was further improvement in fitness levels in
both groups by week 26 (although no significant difference between
groups). No significant difference in HRQOL measures between
groups was demonstrated; however, the exercise group did show an
improvement in their mental health scores. The focus groups centred
on feelings of isolation, abandonment, vulnerability, dependency and
reduced physical activity post hospital discharge. Many reported a
lack of social inclusion as they did not have the energy or confidence
to venture outside. However, those in the exercise group felt that
the rehabilitation programme was motivating, built up confidence,
improved fitness, helped social interaction and gave them a sense of
achievement.

Conclusion The 8-week exercise intervention resulted in statistically
significant improvements in fitness at 9 weeks while focus group
participants highlighted the positive effects of the exercise intervention
leading to enhanced energy levels, motivation and achievement.
Psychological benefits of the exercise programme are apparent from
the focus group, emphasising the important link between physical and
mental health.

Feasibility of neuromuscular electrical stimulation in critically ill
patients

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P535 (doi: 10.1186/cc12473)

Introduction Survivors of critical illness often have a prolonged stay
on the ICU. These patients may suffer from ICU-acquired weakness. It
has been shown that reduction in muscle mass and muscle strength
occurs early after admission to the ICU. However, in the very early stage
on the ICU, patients are often sedated and not able to participate in
any active mobilizations. Therefore the use of neuromuscular electrical
stimulation (NMES) is becoming a treatment of interest in the ICU. The
aim was to study the feasibility and safety of NMES in a surgical and
medical ICU of a large, tertiary referral university hospital.

Methods Fifty patients with an expected prolonged stay on the ICU
of 5 more days (judged on day 3) with no trauma or neurological
disease were included. They then received daily a NMES session (DUO
500; Gymna, Belgium) for 25 minutes on the quadriceps bilaterally
during their entire stay on the ICU. The main outcome was the ability
to produce a contraction of the quadriceps through NMES. The muscle
contraction was quantified on a 5-point scale: 1 (no contraction
palpable and visible) up to 5 (contraction very well palpable and visible).
Patients were classified as responders when an adequate muscle bulk
was obtained in =>75% of the sessions. The potential factors associated
with the feasibility were: gender, age, body mass index (BMI), diagnosis
of sepsis, Barthel index prior to admission to the hospital, APACHE II
score, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), five questions for adequacy, stimulus
intensity and leg edema. A multiple regression analysis was performed
to identify the factors determining whether or not a contraction could
be expected in a patient. Safety of NMES was assessed through heart
rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and respiratory rate.

Results In 48% of the patients we were able to achieve adequate muscle
contractions in more than 75% of the sessions. GCS (P = 0.047), edema

(P = 0.001) and sepsis (P = 0.010) were significantly different between
responders and nonresponders. Responders had a lower mean GCS
(7 + 3 vs. 9 + 3), lower amount of edema and were less likely to have
had sepsis. In a multiple regression analysis, sepsis, edema, BMI and age
explained 51% of the variance. As for safety, none of the parameters
changed significantly.

Conclusion In patients with a better neurological condition, sepsis and/
or leg edema it was more difficult to obtain an adequate quadriceps
contraction with NMES. NMES is safe to apply on the ICU.

Introduction Trauma is the most common cause of morbidity in young
people. It has a high social impact both because of the high cost of
the acute treatments and because of the physical and psychological
consequences that it may cause. A prospective, observational, single-
center study on quality of life 12 to 24 months after trauma was carried
out. The aim of the study is to evaluate life quality after trauma and to
identify the most important needs of the patients, in order to improve
the level of care after an ICU stay and to implement a faster and more
effective reintegration into the active and productive society.
Methods All patients admitted to the 18-bed ICU of our university
hospital between 5 May 2010 and 28 February 2011 because of a
trauma who stayed in the ICU for at least 48 hours were eligible for the
study. Patients were contacted and invited to attend a multidisciplinary
interview. Data concerning family, working and economic status, main
disabilities and medical needs were collected. The SF12 questionnaire
was administered to define physical component summary (PCS) and
mental component summary (MCS) scores. SPSS 20.0 was used to
perform statistical analysis.

Results Sixty-two patients matched inclusion criteria and were
contacted. Thirty-three patients (90.9% males; age 38.7 + 14.3 years;
mean SAPS II 33.75 + 11.79) were interviewed. Mean ICU stay was
25.7 + 15.3 days. Fifteen patients (45.5%) had undergone temporary
tracheostomy. Twenty-six patients were employed at the moment
of trauma: of these, 11 (42.3%) stated to be jobless and one was
pensioned at follow-up. In the whole cohort, the unemployment
rate increased from 12.1 to 45.6%. Mean PCS was 43.59 + 6.43, mean
MCS was 41.04 + 7.69. At follow-up, the 14 employed patients had a
lower MCS versus the 19 jobless patients (37.94 + 7.14 vs. 43.33 + 7.44;
P = 0.04), while no differences concerning PCS were found. The three
patients that were living on their own when the trauma occurred
showed, at follow-up, a lower mean MCS score towards the rest of the
cohort (32.2 + 0.47 vs. 41.93 + 7.51; P <0.001).

Conclusion Trauma is associated with an increase of the unemployment
rate in young people. Patients that are employed at follow-up seemed
to have a worse mental health status towards the unemployed ones.
Conversely, the employed patients did not show any trend to a
lower physical health status. Thus a counseling service that provides
psychological care would be useful to implement more effective work
reintegration for trauma patients.

Post-traumatic stress disorder — are we doing all we can? A UK
national-based survey

X Watson

Ashford and St Peter’s Hospital, Surrey, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P537 (doi: 10.1186/cc12475)

Introduction Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a well-recognised
complication in patients discharged from the ICU. ICU clinics have
been recommended to treat physical and psychosocial problems post
discharge, with guidelines issued by the Department of Health UK [1].
Recent evidence has advocated the use of patient diaries to reduce the

S197

incidence of new-onset PTSD [2]. Family support groups may also play
a pivotal role [3]. We performed a national survey via the Intensive Care
Society (ICS) to determine the provision of follow-up clinics, patient
diary services and family support groups.
Methods An online structured questionnaire was sent via the ICS to all
ICU linkmen at 124 hospitals in the UK. Responses were received from
77 |CUs, a 62% response rate.
Results Out of 77 ICUs, 37 (48%) run a follow-up clinic. The majority
of clinics (51%) only invite patients who have been admitted for more
than 3 to 4 days. Only 10 clinics (30%) receive funding from the ICU
budget or PCT, with the majority (67%) receiving no funding at all. Only
44% (34) of ICUs use patient diaries, mostly as a nonfunded service
(68%). Additionally, 91% of ICUs do not run family support groups; from
the minority that do, these are mostly held quarterly and are largely not
funded (55%).
Conclusion This survey demonstrates that the provision of ICU clinics
in the UK is not well established, with only 48% currently providing
a regular service. Currently 67% of clinics are not funded and further
resources should be employed so this service becomes an integral
part of the ICU pathway. Despite recent evidence demonstrating that
diaries reduce new-onset PTSD, only 44% of ICUs in our study provide
this service. Ninety-one per cent of ICUs do not provide family support
groups; similarly, it appears that financial constraints are the limiting
factor.

Implementation of an ICU follow-up clinic: outcomes and patient
satisfaction after 1 year

G De la Cerda

Queens Hospital, London, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P538 (doi: 10.1186/cc12476)

Introduction The aim was to analyse the outcomes and patient
satisfaction of a recently implemented ICU follow-up clinic. These
clinics are National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommended [1].
Methods A retrospective analysis of prospective collected data
from January to December 2012. The clinic is run monthly by an ICU
consultant and a critical care outreach sister. Criteria to be invited to the
clinic are mechanical ventilation =3 days. Patients filled an anonymous
satisfaction survey after the clinic.

Results Our attendance rate is 50% (26 patients), which is similar to
other series reported in the literature. Those patients who attended the
clinic required a longer length of mechanical ventilation (5.3 days vs.
7.1) and a longer length of stay in the ICU (7.6 vs. 13) and in hospital
(14 vs. 28). We identified a wide range of physical and nonphysical
morbidities on these patients (Figure 1). We referred them to the
appropriate specialities. Patients were very satisfied with this new

service (Figure 2).

Acute exercise response in the critically ill

N Collings', R Young?

‘University Hospital Southampton, UK; *Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield,
UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P539 (doi: 10.1186/cc12477)

Introduction This study aims to quantify the acute exercise response to
early passive and active activities in order to inform exercise prescription
when designing rehabilitation programmes for the critically ill. Critical
care survival is often associated with a poor functional outcome [1],
with recent investigations presenting the case for early rehabilitation
in order to optimise functional recovery [2]. There, remains, however,
a scarcity of research investigating the immediate response to exercise
and subsequent exercise prescription, in the acute phase following
critical illness.

Methods This study is a prospective randomised controlled trial with
a repeated-measures crossover design. Eligible participants, requiring
mechanical ventilation for 4 or more days, completed two exercise
activities routinely used in early critical care rehabilitation, a passive
chair transfer (PCT) and active sitting on the edge of the bed (SOEOB).
The oxygen consumption and cardiovascular parameters were
measured to quantify and compare the exercise response between the
two activities.

Results Data are presented as the median (interquartile range). Data for
five patients have been collected, aged 68 years (23), with an ITU stay of

Table 1 (abstract P539)

Parameter PCT(n=5) SOEOB (n=5)
Oxygen consumption (ml/minute) 270 (46.5) 334 (121)
Carbon dioxide production (ml/minute) 142 (45.5) 185 (121)
Heart rate (bpm) 92 (24) 77.5 (29)
Mean arterial pressure (mmHg) 100.3 (20) 97.3 (13)
Minute ventilation (I/minute) 11.0 (3.5) 12.1 (3.4)

15 days (10.5) and duration of mechanical ventilation 8 days (12), at the
point of intervention. Exercise response results are reported (Table 1).
Conclusion Intensive care patients with prolonged mechanical
ventilation demonstrate a higher rate of oxygen consumption when
actively sitting on the edge of the bed, compared with a passive chair
transfer. This may have important consequences for early mobilisation
of the critically ill.

Introduction Optimal patient evaluations of ICU rehabilitation therapy
remain unclear.

Methods One hundred ICU patients with acute respiratory failure
were randomized to receive early rehabilitation (ER) or usual-care (UC).
Cohort 1 (n = 50) received ER as one physical therapy (PT) session/day
versus UC; Cohort 2 (n = 50) received ER as 2 PT/day with the second
session resistance training, versus UC. UC was without ER. Blood was
drawn for cytokines through day 7. Cohort 2 underwent strength and
physical functional assessments using the Short Physical Performance
Battery (SPPB), a valid and reliable measure of physical function
consisting of walking speed, balance, and repeated chair stands. It is
a well-studied composite measure in older persons, but has not been
used in ICU survivors. Small changes of 0.5 to 0.6 points in the SPPB
have been shown to be clinically meaningful.

Results Baseline parameters were similar between groups. Median
days from enrollment to first PT were 4 (IQR 1 to 7.25). Deaths occurred
in eight UC subjects and four in ER (P = 0.22). For both arms, ventilator
days, ICU days and hospital days were not statistically different. ER had
ventilator-free days of 22, 95% Cl = 19.9 to 24.6, where UC had 22.3 days,
19.9 to 24.6, P= 0.99. ICU-free days for ER was 21, 95% Cl = 19.1 to 23.6,
and that for UC was 21.0, 18.8 to 23.2, P = 0.84. Similarly, hospital days
for ER was 16.7, 95% Cl = 11.8 to 21.4, and for UC was 18.2, 13.8 to 22.7,
P = 0.45. TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 through day 7 were not different between
groups. Despite similar baseline acuity and inflammatory profiles,
Cohort 2 ER group strength scores were numerically but not statistically
higher. Grip strength, as a percentage of predicted for ER was 66 versus

39 for UC, P=0.06. Dynamometry for ER was 211 versus 181 Ibs for UC,
P = 0.124. Although the difference in SPPB values for ER versus UC (5
vs. 3, P= 0.172) was not statistically different, it was greater than the
minimal clinically significant difference. There were no differences in
adverse events.

Conclusion In this pilot study, early ICU rehabilitation was safe, and was
associated with numerically although not statistically shorter hospital
stay, greater strength and improved functional scores. Particularly, the
SPPB demonstrated discriminatory ability in groups of ICU survivors
with low physical function. Future early ICU rehabilitation studies
should consider ICU survivor assessments using the SPPB due to its
ease, reproducibility and discriminatory ability following ICU and
hospital discharge.

Introduction The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
a 6-week exercise programme on outcomes in post-ICU patients.
With improvements in intensive care medicine, increasing numbers
of patients are surviving catastrophic illness [1]. Severe weakness
is common in patients with prolonged critical illness and results in
considerable morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs [2]. The NICE83
guidelines Rehabilitation in Critical Care recommend follow-up for
post-ICU patients and that further research is needed in this field [3].
Methods Patients who have been discharged home from hospital
following an ICU stay of 48 hours or more were recruited to the study.
Patients were only excluded if they were not considered safe for
exercise. Baseline measurements were completed prior to stratified
(age, gender, APACHE II score) random allocation to either the exercise
or control group. Outcome measures included cardiopulmonary
fitness (6-minute walk test), balance (Berg Balance Scale), grip strength
(JAMAR grip dynamometer) and hospital anxiety and depression (HAD
score). The exercise group completed a 6-week supervised exercise
programme, twice a week for up to 1 hour. In the seventh week, all
patients repeated the baseline measurements. An unpaired Student's
t test was used to compare any differences between the control and
exercise groups.
Results At baseline measurements, there were no statistical differences
in age, gender, length of stays or APACHE II scores between the two
groups. Results indicate that the exercise group (n = 10) had significantly
greater improvements in cardiopulmonary fitness (P <0.001) and
balance (P <0.05) compared with the control group (n = 10). Greater
improvements were also evident in anxiety, depression and grip
strength in the exercise group, although not statistically significant.
Conclusion This pilot study highlights that a 6-week supervised
exercise programme can significantly improve cardiopulmonary fitness
and balance in post-ICU patients. Further recruitment to the study and
6-month/1-year follow-up is needed.

Recognition of the primary stressors affecting intensive care
patients: a systematic review

S Birch, S Elliot

Leeds Teaching Hospitals, Leeds University Teaching Hospitals Trust, Leeds, UK
Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P542 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12480)

Introduction Intensive care patients suffer psychological and
physiological distress that may have debilitating and long-lasting
effects [1-3]. Healthcare professionals are in a position to help avoid

S199

or alleviate this stress [4]. To action this it is important to identify the
main stressors from the patient’s perspective. A systematic review
was performed to provide a list of what patients consider stressors
in intensive care. These were then ranked in order to provide an
identification tool that can be used to shape appropriate care.
Methods A systematic review was performed using MEDLINE, CINAHL,
Psych INFO and Academic Search Complete. Grey literature was
included and searches were not restricted to type of intensive care or
country. Criteria were used to filter those articles that identified the
patients’ views of their stressor, not the patient experience. Eligible
articles were critiqued using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for
qualitative studies [5] and brought together using a narrative synthesis.
All of the reviewed studies used a questionnaire as a means to identify
what elements on the intensive care patients found stressful. A list
of the top-10 stressors could then be expressed for each study and
compared. From this information, a set of guidelines for best practice
were devised.

Results A total 1,424 articles were systematically assessed for suitability
and applicability. Of these, 14 articles remained eligible for review. The
stressors were ranked by their frequency in the individual studies’ top-
10 lists. In rank order: 1, Tubes. 2, Pain. 3, Sleep Difficulties. 4, Thirst.
5, Lack of Patient Understanding. Overall, stressors were found to be
similar throughout all of the studies.

Conclusion The review identified a list of the most pertinent common
stressors. Awareness of these and ranking in priority may enable plans
of care to be instigated to effectively alleviate patient stress.

Introduction This study describes the development and validation
of the Consumer Quality Index Relatives in ICUs (CQI ‘R-ICU’), which
aims to measure the satisfaction of relatives and to identify aspect
of care that need improvement in the ICU in a reliable and valid way.
According to the quality standards of the Dutch Society of Intensive
Care, every ICU needs to record the satisfaction of relatives [1]. At this
moment there is insufficient insight into the quality of care offered to
relatives on the ICU because an evidence-based Dutch measurement
instrument is missing.

Methods The CQI’R-ICU’ has been developed based on a scientific and
standardised method [2]. A mixed design method is used, consisting of
qualitative and quantitative survey studies. Factor analyses are carried
out to determine the underlying structure of the newly developed
questionnaire. Multiple regression analysis is used to explore the
relationship between demographic variables and the perceived quality
of care.

Results In six hospitals the CQI‘R-ICU’ is sent to relatives after receiving
informed consent (n = 441), 55.1% of the respondents are the patient's
partner. Respondents seem to be most satisfied with the presence
of a professional at first entrance to the ICU. The highest need for
improvement scores relate to information about meals, parking
and other disciplines (for example, social worker, spiritual worker or
psychologist). Factor analysis shows that quality of care is determined
by four clusters of items: Support, Communication, General Information
and Organisation. The reliability of the CQI ‘R-ICU’ is sufficiently high,
only Communication and Support are significant predictors of total
quality judgement of relatives (adj. R? = 0.74). In addition, there is a
significant difference in mean total quality judgement between the six
hospitals as well as between the four wards within Erasmus MC. None

of the demographic variables such as sex, age, education, race and

length of stay had an effect on perceived quality of care.

Conclusion The CQI ‘R-ICU’ turned out to be a valid, reliable, sensitive

and feasible instrument. Large-scale implementation is recommended.

Family satisfaction in the ICU: enhancing patient experience
E Kursumovic, J Bilinska, A Molokhia

University Hospital Lewisham, London, UK

Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P544 (doi: 10.1186/cc 12482)

Introduction Following recommendations made by the Scottish
Intensive Care Society [1], we have introduced an annual Family
Satisfaction Survey in the intensive care unit (FS-ICU), in anticipation
that this will become an integral part of how we measure, improve
and strive to advance patient care in the future. We aim to recognise
factors impacting patient care and highlight areas for improvement.
Improving understanding of patients’ needs is currently a UK national
goal for CQUIN 2011/2012. An estimated £6.9 billion per year can be
saved by reaching these goals [2] and a positive patient experience
results in improved long-term outcomes and shorter hospital stays [2].
Methods We performed a study to assess Family Satisfaction over a 10-
week period in a 16-bed critical care unit (CCU). A modified version of
an FS-ICU published in US and Canadian studies [3] was distributed to
up to two family members per patient. Five-point Likert scale responses
were linearly transformed to give percentage scores. Higher values
represented a greater degree of satisfaction.

Results We received and analysed 32 completed surveys. Seventy-
eight per cent of relatives reported that the treatment of the patient
was excellent, including symptom control such as pain, breathlessness
and agitation (72%, 69%, 100%, respectively). Ninety-one per cent
felt the care and frequency of communication provided by nurses
was excellent or very good, compared with 81% by doctors. Only 9%
of family members were offered spiritual support during their CCU
experience. Forty-seven per cent felt they would have liked more
involvement in the decision-making process.

Conclusion The vast majority of relatives rated their overall experience
on CCU as excellent or very good. The study highlighted two main areas
for improvement: provision of spiritual support as well as family and
patient involvement in the decision-making process. We will arrange
multi-disciplinary teaching sessions focusing on the positive impact,
and therefore importance of patient satisfaction. A poster providing
information about available spiritual support will be displayed around
our CCU. Further studies are required to evaluate these measures.

Introduction We are conducting a cluster randomized trial with two
parallel arms to evaluate strategies to improve family satisfaction with
the care that themselves and their critically ill relatives receive in the
ICUs of nonacademic Brazilian public hospitals. Here we report the
results of the baseline phase of this trial.

Methods In this baseline phase, we interviewed the family member
most closely involved with the care of critically ill patients who stayed
in the ICU for at least 72 hours. We applied a form with 24 questions
divided into four domains: overall ICU experience, communication,
decision-making, and questions related to end-of-life care for patients
who died in the ICU. Each question scored from 0 (very poor) to 100
(excellent). The form was adapted from the Family Satisfaction with
Care in the ICU (FS-ICU 24). As many questions assessed the quality
of intensivist care or communication, the interview was applied by a
psychologist or a nurse.

Results Families of 564 patients were interviewed. A total 45/564
(8.3%) died in the ICU. Most respondents were satisfied with overall ICU
experience (mean + SD score 85.5 + 11.9). However, family satisfaction
with communication (67.8 + 18.0) and decision-making (69.5 + 21.1)
resulted in somewhat lower scores. Most families of patients who
died in the ICU (38/45 (82.6%)) considered that their relative’s life
was neither extended nor shortened unnecessarily. Also, most of the
families believed that their relative did not suffer or suffered little in the
ICU (37/46 (80.4%)) and felt supported by the healthcare team (40/46
(87.0%)).

Conclusion Most families were satisfied with the care themselves and
their critically ill relatives received in the ICU. Also, most relatives of
patients who died in the ICU felt that end-of-life care was adequate.
Although we believe there is much room for improvement in
communication, decision-making and support critically ill patients and
their families, as their baseline satisfaction with patient care is quite
high, it may be hard to demonstrate substantial improvement after
interventions.
