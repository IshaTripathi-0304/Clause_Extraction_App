CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
GOVERNING THE INSPECTION OF STOCKHOLDER LIST

This Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement Governing the Inspection of
Stockholder List (the “Agreement”) is entered into between Patriot Scientific Corporation
(the “Company”), and the “Stockholder”. The Company and the Stockholder are each
individually referred to herein as a “Party” and are collectively referred to as the “Parties.”

WHEREAS, on or about April 30, 2015, the Stockholder made a demand (the “Demand”) to
inspect the stockholder list of the Company;

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Demand and subject to the Stockholder executing this
Agreement, the Company has agreed to allow the Stockholder to inspect the stockholder
list (which, together with information or analyses derived from information made available
for inspection, is referred to as the “Confidential Material”);

WHEREAS, the Company believes that stockholder list contains confidential information;
IT IS HEREBY AGREED, by and between the Parties, this 30 day of April 2015, as follows:

1. Stockholder agrees that the Confidential Material is being produced to them only for
purposes reasonably related to Stockholder’s interests as a stockholder of the Company
and that Stockholder shall not utilize Confidential Material, any other information
produced by the Company or anything derived from Confidential Material or derived
from any other information produced by the Company for any other purpose.

2. The Stockholder will not disclose, publish, or communicate Confidential Material to any
person or entity in any form (written, oral, electronic or through any other medium),
either directly or indirectly, except as provided in this Confidentiality Agreement to
end; provided that in no event shall stockholder, directly or indirectly, publically
disclose, publish or communicate names, addresses, holdings of any other stockholder.

3. If the Stockholder is required (by interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigatory demand,
or any similar process relating to any legal proceeding, investigation, hearing, or
otherwise) to disclose in any manner any Confidential Material, the Stockholder will
provide the Company with prompt notice (i.e., within 2 business days of receipt of such
interrogatory, subpoena, demand, or any similar process), so that the Company may
seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with this
Agreement in the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or if
the Company waives compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, the
Stockholder may furnish only such Confidential Material as they are advised is legally
required and must exercise their best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded to any Confidential Material.

4. Each Party who receives Confidential Material pursuant to this Agreement agrees to
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery in any action to
enforce any provision of, or based on any right or claim arising out of, this Agreement

including any action to determine any dispute as to the confidentiality of any
information or document produced by the Company. Each Party hereby expressly
waives any and all objections such Party may have to personal jurisdiction or to venue,
including without limitation the inconvenience of such forum, in the Court of Chancery.

5. Each Party agrees that the Company does not have an adequate remedy at law in the
event of a breach of this Agreement by the Stockholder. The Parties further agree that,
in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Stockholder, the Company will suffer
irreparable harm and will be entitled to specific performance and/or injunctive relief to
enforce the terms of this Agreement. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the
exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to any
other remedies to which the Company may be entitled at law or in equity.

6. This Agreement may not be amended, changed, waived, discharged, or terminated
(except as explicitly provided herein), in whole or in part, except by an instrument in
writing that refers specifically to this Agreement and that is signed by the Party against
whom enforcement of such amendment, change, waiver, discharge, or termination is
sought. The waiver by any Party of any breach of this Agreement will not be deemed or
construed as a waiver of any other breach of this Agreement, whether prior, subsequent,
or contemporaneous. No failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.

7. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective agents, executors, heirs, beneficiaries, successors, and assigns.

8. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

9. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts by any of the signatories
hereto and as so executed shall constitute one agreement.

10. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with regard to the
subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, written
and oral, between the Parties with regard to the subject matter hereof.

11. This Agreement will be deemed to have been mutually prepared by the Parties and will
not be construed against either of them by reason of authorship.
