EXECUTIVE ORDER
GA 09

Relating to hospital capacity during the COVID-19 disaster.

WHEREAS, I, Greg Abbott, Governor of Texas, issued a disaster proclamation on March 13,
2020, certifying under Section 418.014 of the Texas Government Code that the novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) poses an imminent threat of disaster for all counties in the State of
Texas; and

WHEREAS, the Texas Department of State Health Services has determined that, as of March 19,
2020, COVID-19 represents a public health disaster within the meaning of Chapter 81 of the
Texas Health and Safety Code; and

WHEREAS, on March 19, 2020, I issued an executive order in accordance with the President’s
Coronavirus Guidelines for America, as promulgated by President Donald J. Trump and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and mandated certain obligations for
Texans that are aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19; and

WHEREAS, a shortage of hospital capacity or personal protective equipment would hinder
efforts to cope with the COVID-19 disaster; and

WHEREAS, hospital capacity and personal protective equipment are being depleted by surgeries
and procedures that are not medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition or to
preserve the life of a patient, contrary to recommendations from the President’s Coronavirus
Task Force, the CDC, the U.S. Surgeon General, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services; and

WHEREAS, various hospital licensing requirements would stand in the way of implementing
increased occupancy in the event of surge needs for hospital capacity due to COVID-19; and

WHEREAS, the “governor is responsible for meeting ... the dangers to the state and people
presented by disasters” under Section 418.011 of the Texas Government Code, and the
legislature has given the governor broad authority to fulfill that responsibility; and

WHEREAS, under Section 418.012, the “governor may issue executive orders... hav[ing] the
force and effect of law;” and

WHEREAS, under Section 418.016(a), the “governor may suspend the provisions of any
regulatory statute prescribing the procedures for conduct of state business or the orders or rules
of a state agency if strict compliance with the provisions, orders, or rules would in any way
prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with a disaster;” and

March 22, 2020 Page 2

WHEREAS, under Section 418.173, failure to comply with any executive order issued during the
COVID-19 disaster is an offense punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000, confinement in jail
for a term not to exceed 180 days, or both fine and confinement.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, Greg Abbott, Governor of Texas, by virtue of the power and authority
vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the State of Texas, do hereby order that, beginning
now and continuing until 11:59 p.m. on April 21, 2020, all licensed health care professionals and
all licensed health care facilities shall postpone all surgeries and procedures that are not
immediately medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition of, or to preserve the life
of, a patient who without immediate performance of the surgery or procedure would be at risk for
serious adverse medical consequences or death, as determined by the patient’s physician;

PROVIDED, however, that this prohibition shall not apply to any procedure that, if performed in
accordance with the commonly accepted standard of clinical practice, would not deplete the
hospital capacity or the personal protective equipment needed to cope with the COVID-19
disaster.
