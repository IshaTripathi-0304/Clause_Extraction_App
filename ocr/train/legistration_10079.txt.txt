OFFICE OF
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER

TO: ALL HEALTH CARRIERS AUTHORIZED OR ADMITTED TO OFFER HEALTH
PLANS OR SHORT TERM LIMITED DURATION MEDICAL PLANS IN
WASHINGTON STATE THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE INSURANCE
COMMISSIONER

FROM: MIKE KREIDLER, INSURANCE COMMISSIONER

RE: FURTHER EXTENDING EMERGENCY ORDER 20-01 PURSUANT TO RCW
48.02.060(5)

Pursuant to RCW 48.02.060(5), the Insurance Commissioner’s Emergency Order 20-01, issued
on March 5, 2020, and previously extended until June 3, 2020, and then extended again until July 3, 2020,
and then extended again until August 2, 2020, and then extended again until August 27, 2020, and then
extended again until September 27, 2020, and then extended again until October 25, 2020, and then
extended again until November 24, 2020, and then extended again until December 24, 2020, and then
extended again until January 23, 2021, and then extended again until February 21, 2021, and then
extended again until March 21, 2021, and then extended again until April 18, 2021, and then extended
again until May 16, 2021, and then extended again until June 13, 2021, is hereby further extended until
July 11, 2021.

The Commissioner finds that the State of Emergency caused by the ongoing COVID-19 novel
coronavirus outbreak, as identified in the Commissioner’s Emergency Order 20-01, remains in effect. As
a result, there is a continued need to ensure access to health care services. In the Insurance
Commissioner’s judgment, the circumstances of the ongoing COVID-19 novel coronavirus outbreak
warrant the extension of the duration of Emergency Order 20-01.

RCW 48.02.060(5) states that an order by the Insurance Commissioner under subsection (4) of
this section may remain effective for not more than sixty (60) days unless the Insurance Commissioner
extends the termination date for the order for an additional period of not more than thirty (30) days. The
Insurance Commissioner may extend the order if, in the Insurance Commissioner’s judgment, the
circumstances warrant an extension.

THEREFORE, the expiration date of Emergency Order 20-01 is hereby EXTENDED BY
30 DAYS, pursuant to the Insurance Commissioner’s authority in RCW 48.02.060(5). Emergency
Order 20-01 is therefore in effect until July 11, 2021.
