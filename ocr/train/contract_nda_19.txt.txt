WHAT IS A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT?

A Nondisclosure Agreement, sometimes called a confidentiality agreement, is a contract whereby one or both
of the parties agree that information, ideas, etc. exchanged between them will not be shared with outsiders.
Essentially, the information will be treated as confidential.

WHY USE A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT?

Nondisclosure agreements (“NDAs”) are generally used when a company or individual has a story idea, or a
new process, invention, product or even a business plan, that it wants the recipient to evaluate. Generally, this
is done with an eye toward eventually selling or licensing the material to the recipient. Most of the time the NDA
restricts the recipient's use of the information to evaluation purposes only, requiring a license or purchase
before the recipient can use the information in its business.

NDAs can serve several purposes. They are used to protect sensitive creative, technical or commercial
information from theft. If the information is revealed to a third party the injured party, or used by the recipient
without permission, he disclosing party has cause to claim a breach of contract and can seek injunctive and
monetary damages.

An NDA can also help a discloser avoid forfeiture of patent rights. Under Patent law, once a novel invention is
publicly available (i.e., “in the public domain”) it is no longer eligible for patent protection.

Finally, an NDA can be used to articulate the specifics of which information can and cannot be disclosed.
Typically as a result of negotiation to identify and classify the nondisclosible information as confidential or
proprietary. Disclosing parties seek the broadest definition, while recipients generally prefer the narrowest
definition. By carefully negotiating the NDA, a recipient of new ideas and information can protect itself against
later claims of unfair competition or misappropriation.

WHAT SHOULD AN NDA COVER?

It is important for the recipient to carefully identify the kinds of material that are NOT covered by the NDA. For
example, information already known to the recipient, or known to the public should not be subject to treatment
as confidential. Likewise, information which becomes known to recipient from a third party, and by no fault of
the recipient should be excluded. Finally, many NDAs exclude information independently created by the
recipient.

An NDA is only as good as the procedures it articulates for the handling of confidential material. Typically, the
NDA requires that the parties will treat each other's confidential information as though it were its own. This
assumes, however, that the recipient has established protocols for handling confidential material. Obviously
where no such protocols already exist, it is prudent to more specifically lay out provisions governing access to
the confidential information. In many cases, this involves labeling the information as "confidential" and defining
where it is to be kept, who within the organization may view it, etc.

Although almost any kind of information can be considered confidential(ideas, stories, character descriptions,
data, know-how, prototypes, engineering drawings, computer software, test results, tools, systems, and
specifications are but a few illustrations) NDAs are only infrequently used in the entertainment industry. More
commonly, recipients of literary material, pitches, etc., insist on a comprehensive submission release . (More
about these in a future article)

CONCLUSION

There are any number of situations that call for the use of a Nondisclosure agreement. Knowing the basic
purpose and structure of such agreements is an important first step toward protecting one's intellectual property
assets. The assistance of an experienced attorney can help avoid oversights, ambiguities and other costly
mistakes.
