and Restated Executive Order’), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in
response to COVID-19; and

WHEREAS, all states in the region, including Vermont, have experienced community
transmission of COVID-19 which has led to hundreds of thousands of cases and thousands of
deaths within a five-hour drive of Vermont’s borders; and

WHEREAS, the Governor, in consultation with the Vermont Department of Health (VDH), has
initiated aggressive and sustained efforts to protect property and public health, and to ensure public

and Directives issued pursuant to the Executive Order to limit in-person contact, such as limiting

the 2019-2020 school year, directing the postponement of non-essential medical and surgical
procedures, suspending the operation of close contact businesses, requiring telecommuting and
work from home, requiring Vermonters to stay home and stay safe with exceptions for essential

health and safety and national and economic security; and

WHEREAS, in connection with the Governor’s cautious, measured and data-based approach to
restarting Vermont’s economy in a safe and effective way, on April 20, 2020, the Governor issued

health and safety advice of VDH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
including wearing facial coverings when appropriate; and

WHEREAS, as we look forward to our college and preK-12 students returning to school, as well
as the foliage and winter recreation seasons and the increase in indoor congregation by Vermonters
as the seasons change, the Governor has determined, in consultation with the Commissioner of
VDH, that we should strengthen the State’s policy on masks and facial coverings in order to protect
public health and the progress we have achieved in suppressing the virus.

NOW THEREFORE, I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor of
Vermont by the Constitution of the State of Vermont, Chapter I, Section 20 and under 20 V.S.A.
§§ 8, 9 and 11, hereby order the amendment of the Amended and Restated Executive Order as
follows:

Section 7(f) of the Amended and Restated Executive Order regarding Mask Use is hereby
amended in its entirety to read as follows:

(f) Masks or Cloth Facial Coverings Required in Public Wherever Close Contact 1s Unavoidable.
As of Saturday, August 1, 2020, Vermonters shall wear masks or cloth facial coverings over their

nose and mouth any time they are in public spaces, indoors or outdoors, where they come in contact
with others from outside their households, especially in congregate settings, and where it is not
possible to maintain a physical distance of at least six feet.

Nothing 1n this Order or any other State health and safety guidance shall require the use of a mask
or cloth facial covering when someone is engaged in strenuous exercise or activity, for anyone
under the age of 2, any child or adult with a medical or developmental issue or challenge that is
complicated or irritated by a facial covering, anyone with difficulty breathing or as further set forth
in guidance issued by VDH.

A person who declines to wear a mask or cloth face covering because of a medical or
developmental issue, or difficulty breathing, shall not be required to produce documentation, or
other evidence, verifying the condition.

Businesses and non-profit and government entities shall implement measures notifying customers
or clients of the requirement to wear masks or facial coverings, which may include, but shall not
be limited to, posting signage stating that masks or cloth facial coverings are required and denial
of entry or service to customers or clients who decline to wear masks or facial coverings.

For the sake of clarity, the requirements for masks or facial coverings or permitted alternatives in
specific circumstances shall continue to apply as set forth in the following guidance:
e Phased Restart Work Safe Guidance issued by the Secretary of the Agency of Commerce
and Community Development (ACCD) permitting limited alternatives to face masks in

----$$$$----$$$$----
limited workplace settings, as well as some flexibility on use of masks or facial coverings
in other circumstances, such as when eating 1n a restaurant;

e Safety and Health Guidance for Reopening Schools, Fall 2020 issued by the Secretary of
the Agency of Education (AoE);

e Health Guidance for Childcare and School Age Camps/Care issued by the VDH, AoE and

e Guidance to Healthcare Providers issued by the VDH; and

e Other as set by a designated Secretary or Commissioner, with the approval of the Governor.

This Addendum 2 to the Amended and Restated Executive Order shall take effect upon
signing and shall continue in full force and effect until midnight on August 15, 2020, at which
time the Governor, in consultation with the Vermont Department of Health and the
Department of Public Safety shall assess the emergency and determine whether to amend or
extend this Addendum.
