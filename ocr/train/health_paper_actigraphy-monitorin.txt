study examined the level of physical activity measured by actigraphy over time and whether change in phys-
ical activity was associated with disease severity assessed by UPDRS.

Actigrapby We used a longitudinal design in which physical activity and disease severity were assessed repeatedly during a
Parkinson's disease 4-month interval, over a 3-year observational period, in a sample of 61 patients with idiopathic PD and a control
Power-law exponent group of 32 neurologically intact individuals. Physical activity data during awake-time were analyzed using the

power-law exponent (PLE) method. Correlational relationships between changes in maxima values of PLE and
scores of total UPDRS, UPDRS—part II (Activities of Daily Living), and UPDRS—part III (Motor Examination) in
patients with PD were examined. Results show an increase in maxima values of PLE and the UPDRS total score in
PD patients and that there is a positive association between changes in maxima values and total UPDRS score
(r = 0.746, p = 0.032), UPDRS—part II score (r = 0.687, p = 0.027), and UPDRS—part III score (r = 0.893,
p = 0.018). There was no significant change in the level of physical activity over time for the controls.
Findings from this study indicate that change in physical activity, as captured by actigraphy, is associated
with increased severity in patients’ clinical symptoms of PD over time. Thus, these data suggest that, when
used in conjunction with the conventional UPDRS measure, an actigraphic measure of physical activity
may provide clinicians an adjunct measurement approach to monitor patients’ activity-based disease pro-
gression or responses to treatment in outpatient clinic settings.

not be fully captured or understood via the sole use of this clinical rat-
ing scale. Patients' symptoms of disease may well be masked by their
dopaminergic medications and/or disease stages/severity [2]. In the
treatment of patients with PD, the severity of symptoms is conven-
tionally assessed using the UPDRS based on neurological examination,
the patient's diary, or the caregiver's reports. These methods, howev-
er, lack quantitative aspects, thereby making them inadequate for the
precise assessment of drug efficacy [3]. However, none of these studies
have been successful in developing reliable analytical methods that
quantitatively represent the disease progression in patients with PD
[4-6]. Therefore, from a clinical standpoint, additional adjunct clinical
tools that can provide an objective yet concomitant evaluation of
activity-related disease symptoms manifested in daily life and during
disease progression are warranted.

Research has shown that actigraphy-based observations can be use-
ful and effective in objectively assessing activity-related disease symp-
toms such as tremor and motor fluctuations in patients with PD [3-7].
In our own previous work, we have shown that, by analyzing the
power-law exponent (PLE; alpha) for local maxima and minima of se-
verities in the activity time series [5,8,9], variation in physical activity
captured by actigraphy was significantly correlated with the progres-
sion of PD symptoms. Our work suggests that actigraphic data, when
analyzed by the PLE method, may provide clinically useful and objective
information regarding PD patients’ disease severity.

There have been, however, limited accelerometer-based studies that
examine patterns of daily physical activity among independently living
adults and how variation in movement-related activities may be corre-
lated with change in clinically identified symptoms of severity over
time. Addressing these issues could be clinically important in providing
a comprehensive evaluation of patients’ disease status on a range of
symptoms. Their severity information can be subsequently used by
clinicians in aiding their clinical decisions about patients’ treatment
options and/or evaluation of their responses to intervention modalities.

The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine whether daily
physical activity among independently living adults’ physical activity
would be associated with clinically rated symptoms over time in pa-
tients with PD. On the basis of our prior work [5,8-11], we hypothesized
that variation in actigraphic recordings of patients’ kinematics of move-
ment disorder symptoms during awake-time would be correlated with
PD symptoms assessed by UPDRS over time.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study design

We used a longitudinal design in which study participants were
contacted and assessed with the planned study outcome measures
every 4th month over a period of 3 years.

2.2. Participants

A total of 61 outpatients with idiopathic PD and 32 control
participants were recruited from the department of Neurology of
Shuguang Hospital Affiliated with Shanghai University of TCM.
Eligibility criteria for patients with PD included individuals who were
(a) at least 40 years of age, (b) diagnosed on two of the cardinal symp-
toms (bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, or postural instability) assessed
by the UPDRS [1], (c) on dopaminergic medications (i.e., levodopa),
(d) showing no sign of mental deficit (e.g, dementia) and major
depressive disorder, and (e) not affected by unstable cardiovascular
disease or extrapyramidal syndromes due to other central nervous
diseases identified by the investigators. Inclusion criteria for the control
participants included neurologically intact and healthy community-
dwelling adults. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Shuguang Hospital Affiliated with Shanghai University

of TCM according to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.
An informed consent was obtained from each participant.

2.3. Control of medications

Patients’ anti-Parkinson drugs were administered per the interna-
tional medication guidelines [12] and monitored throughout the
study period. Patients were instructed to adjust their medications
for at least 14 days (mean + SD, 30.6 + 15.7) until their symptoms
of PD approached a steady state.

2.4. Outcome assessment

The study included two outcome measures: (a) the UPDRS [1]
and (b) actigraphy. Each is detailed below. Measures were taken at
4-month intervals across a 3-year period.

The UPDRS with two subsections (part II—Activities of Daily Living
[ADL] and part III—Motor Examination [Motor]) was used. Items
contained in UPDRS were rated on a 5-point (0-4) scale, with higher
scores indicating severity of the disease. The UPDRS assessment for
patients with PD was made during an “on” medication status by a
neurologist. All assessments were conducted before actigraphy re-
cordings (described below).

Patients with PD and the controls were given an actigraphy
(MicroMini-Motionlogger®, Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc.) in which
they were instructed to wear the device on their dominant wrist for
24h per day during a 7-day period. Zero-crossing activity counts
[11,12] were recorded every minute to register and quantify partici-
pants’ physical activity.

Once the actigraphy was returned, the wrist activity data recorded
during awake-time were then transmitted to the program software
provided by the manufacturer, and the data were aggregated into
1-minute epochs for analysis using the Action-W (version 2, Ambula-
tory Monitors Inc.). The power-law (scaling) exponent (a), obtained
as the slope of a straight line fit in the double-logarithmic plot of
time scales vs. magnitudes of fluctuation, was used to emphasize
the level of such correlation [9]. As Ohashi et al. [9] demonstrated,
physical activity data have different power-law exponents in periods
with higher and lower activity levels, corresponding to qualitatively
different physiological states. The actual procedures we used are as
follows: First, a daytime physical activity time series was integrated,
as in DFA, and wavelets with different time scales (S) were slid
along the time series and correlated with the data to obtain the wave-
let coefficients (W(S)) at each point. We used the third derivative of
the Gaussian function as the so-called “mother wavelet”:

w(t) = t(3—t?)e

where t is time. This is equivalent to using the Gaussian second deriv-
ative (so-called “Mexican hat”) wavelet to examine the raw signals,
though the integration approach automatically removes the local

yield local minima of the wavelet coefficients. Second, the squared
wavelet coefficients at the local maxima or minima were averaged for
all the available days. As the coefficient gives the magnitude of local
fluctuations matching the shape of y(t) with different time scales, the
squared W(S) was used, again as in DFA. Finally, the power-law expo-
nent (a) was obtained separately for local maxima and minima as the
slope of a straight line fit in the double-logarithmic plot of S vs. W(S)?.
In this study, the range of S corresponding to 8 to 35 min, where accept-
able linear relationships between log S and log W(S)? were observed for
all the records, was used [2,10,11]. This range is also approximately the
same as that used in Ohashi et al., and this method yields the same
a-values as does DFA, but separately for periods with higher and
lower activity levels. In other words, a lower value for local maxima or
minima of activity recordings reflects more frequent switching behavior
from low to high or high to low physical activity, respectively, and the
switching behavior from lower to higher activity levels is considered
to be related to akinesia in patients with PD.

In patients with PD, the PLE a-values for local maxima did not
differ between the arms with tremor and those without tremor, but
were significantly lower in both of the patient groups than in the control
arms, indicating that, although the presence of tremor greatly influenced
the actigraphic counts, the presence of tremor did not yield false positive
results in the PLE for maxima [2]. In this study, we analyzed the local
maxima for the awake-time of each record in the series of time windows
observed.

2.5. Statistical analysis

A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed
to evaluate longitudinal changes from baseline to 3-year follow-up in
UPDRS total score, UPDRS part IT—ADL score, UPDRS part III—Motor
score, and PLE alpha values. Pearson's bivariate correlations were
analyzed to examine the relationship between changes in the UPDRS
total score and subscale scores and changes in the PLE alpha values.
The alpha (a) level for significance was set at p < 0.05. Analysis of the
data was carried out using SPSS (Version 17.0), and the resulting data
are presented in mean + stand deviation.

3. Results

In all, five patients with PD withdrew from the study, three because
of medical complications and two because of loss to follow-up. Fifty-six
patients with PD and all control subjects completed the study. Patients’
demographic and clinical profiles at baseline are presented in Table 1.

At the end of 3-year follow-up, there was a significant increase, from
baseline, in patient's UPDRS total score, subscales scores (part II—ADL,
part III—Motor, data not shown), and PLE alpha values observed during
awake-time (Fig. 1A), with 5 points per year in UPDRS score and
0.04 points per year in the PLE maxima alpha values, respectively. The
average alpha values of local maxima, however, were not changed
over time in the control participants (Fig. 1B). Changes in UPDRS total
score and its subscale scores (UPDRS part II—ADL, UPDRS part III—
Motor) were found to be significantly correlated with changes in local
maxima alpha values over time; 0.746 (p = 0.032) (Fig. 1C), 0.687
(p = 0.027) (Fig. 1D), and 0.839 (p = 0.018) (Fig. 1E), respectively.

4. Discussion

This is the first study that uses an actigraphic recording approach
to physical activity over time to evaluate the development of symp-
tom severity in patients with PD. Through the PLE analytic method,
we found that there was a significant increase in patient's wrist activ-
ity during awake-time and that the increase was associated with the
clinically rated PD severity over time.

Previous studies have reported that lower PLE values for local
maxima of activity were related to more frequent switching behavior

from low to high physical activity [2,10,11]. However, these studies
have significant limitations, such as small sample sizes and limited
follow-ups. By using a longitudinal design with repeated measures
and a larger sample size, this study extends the previous analyses by
showing a higher auto-correlation pattern of physical activity over
time compared with the healthy controls. The increase in the local
maxima PLE values may thus indicate the sensitivity of actigraphy in
capturing symptoms of movement disorders seen in PD patients. Our
correlational analyses further show that changes in these movement
symptoms were related to changes in UPDRS part II and III scores,
which reflect severity in day-to-day activities and motor severity.

Although there has been an increasing use of actigraphy to quanti-
tatively evaluate symptoms of PD, such as tremor and sleep disorders
[4-7] and other chronic disease conditions [13-16], few studies have
undertaken evaluation of PD severity by actigraphy [7]. Thus, this
study contributes to a deeper understanding of actigraphy and moni-
toring of symptoms of PD. Our study, however, has limitations. For ex-
ample, our data do not capture symptoms of patients underlying
Parkinsonism during their wearing-off period of medications or alter-
ation between periods “on” and “off’ medications. Our local maxima
of PLE activity data may simply reflect the overall trend and/or
patterns of changes in movement activities over time rather than
short-term moment-to-moment motor fluctuations (medication off
time) and dyskinesia (drug-induced involuntary movements) experi-
enced during on- and off-medication periods. Accordingly, future ef-
forts are needed to evaluate the relationship between wrist activity
and levodopa-induced motor complications.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, we show that actigraphy can be used as an ambulatory
device to monitor symptoms associated with PD over time and that
changes in physical activity are associated with increased fluctuations
in patients’ clinical symptoms of PD over time. Our findings suggest
that, when used in conjunction with the conventional UPDRS measure,
actigraphy may be useful for clinicians to monitor and track patients’
activity-based disease progression or responses to treatment in outpa-
tient clinic settings.
