entered as independent predictors of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV, a
traditional index of arterial stiffness) into the stepwise regression
analysis of sex, antihypertensive medication use, body mass index,
blood test results, resting blood pressure, daily physical activity and
diastolic blood pressure and HR during the exercise (17 = 0.634,
P<0.001). In subgroup analyses according to average SBP during the
exercises, aortic PWV was higher in the high SBP group than the low
SBP group independent of resting SBP (P < 0.001). We concluded that
SBP during resistance exercise is independently correlated with arterial
stiffness. The following steps are to elucidate whether excessive
blood pressure elevation during resistance exercise increases arterials
stiffness by prospective study and to investigate its relationship to ET-1
system.

Introduction: Rheumatic fever represents a serious public health
problem in Brazil, with thousands of new cases each year. It is an
inflammatory and autoimmune disease, which occurs in response to
infection by Streptococcus A group. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the immunolabeling for ET-1,ET-A and ET-B receptors in
rheumatic mitral valves. Methods: This study focused in quantitative
immunoreactivity of ten mitral valves which were collected at a
hospital in Aracaju, SE, Brazil. The quantitative analysis of the
immunocytochemistry area of each receptor in relation to the total
area of each slide was performed by Image] software. Statistical
analysis was performed using measures of central tendency and
standard deviation. In inferential analysis, we used the Pearson
partial correlation (R), with significance level of <0.05. Results: In 10
samples, immunohistochemical expression for ET-1 and for its
receptors was observed in eight and seven samples, respectively. In
quantitative analysis, it was observed that the average area with
expression of ET-1 was 18.21 + 14.96%. For ETrA and ETrB, the mean
expressed areas were respectively 15.06 + 13.13% and 9.20 + 11.09%.
The correlation between the expression of both endothelin receptors
was strongly positive (R: 0.74, p: 0.02), but the correlation between
ET-1 and its receptors were negative for both ETrA (R: — 0.37, p: 0.25),
and ETrB (R: —0.14, p: 0.39). Conclusion: The strong positive
correlation between endothelin receptors (ETrA more demonstrated
than ETrB) suggests that both have a role in the pathophysiology of
rheumatic mitral stenosis.

Objective: Cardiac tamponade is a severe clinical syndrome
most often caused by high-energy thoracic injuries. Following
tamponade, the release of vasoconstrictive mediators contributes
to circulatory redistribution, leading to peripheral macro- and
microcirculatory complications including gastrointestinal hypoper-
fusion. As a consequence of hypoxia the complement system is
activated and anaphylatoxin C5a may be produced. Our aim was to
investigate the modulator effects of complement C5a antagonist
(C5aA) treatment on the endothelin system and the accompanying
circulatory and inflammatory changes in a large animal model of
experimental cardiac tamponade. Methods: In anaesthetized, venti-
lated and thoracotomized minipigs (n = 7) tamponade was induced
for 60 min by intrapericardial fluid administration, meanwhile the
mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced to 40-45 mm Hg. Group
2 was treated with C5aA (AcPepA, Nagoya, Japan) at the 45th min of
tamponade (4mg/kg iv; n= 6), while group 3 (n= 6) served as
sham-operated control. Macrohemodynamics were monitored for
240 min, whole blood superoxide production, plasma HMGB-1 and
big-endothelin (big-ET) levels, small intestinal myeloperoxidase
(MPO) activity were measured. Average red blood cell velocity (a-RBCV)
in the small intestinal mucosa was determined by intravital orthogonal
polarization imaging (OPS) technique. Results: After tamponade plasma
levels of big-ET were increased together with superoxide production,
HMGB-1 levels and MPO activities. The C5aA treatment normalized
the macrohemodynamics, and besides the a-RBCV was increased, SOX,
HMGB-1, MPO and big-ET levels were reduced. Conclusion: These results
demonstrate the possible connections between the activation of
complement- and endothelin systems, and the potential for C5aA to
decrease the potentially harmful inflammatory consequences of exper-
imental cardiogenic shock. Grant supports: OTKA-K104656; TAMOP-

Background: ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (STE-ACS) is
characterized by thrombotic coronary occlusion compromising blood
flow at the epicardial and microvascular levels. Coronary thrombi are
a source of large amounts of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a pro-fibrotic
vasoconstrictor and a mediator of microvascular dysfunction and
cardiac remodeling. Methods: Patients with posterior-wall STE-ACS
were randomly assigned to intravenous BQ-123 or placebo as
described elsewhere (n = 54). During a three-year follow-up period,
patients were followed and kept on optimal medical treatment by an
investigator who was blinded to the acute treatment allocation.
Results: During the median follow-up period of 3.3 years (IQR 2.9-
3.7), no deaths occurred. The reasons for rehospitalisation (n = 19)
were unplanned coronary revascularization (n = 10, 52%), worsen-
ing angina (n = 3, 17%), hypertensive urgency (n = 2, 11%), as well
as stroke (n = 1), dyspnoea (n = 1), ventricular tachycardia (n = 1)
and cerebrovascular disease (n = 1). We observed a longer event-
free survival in patients randomized to receive BQ-123 compared

with patients randomized to placebo (3.8 years (95% Cl: 3.3-4.2) for
BQ-123 versus 2.8 years (2.1-3.4) for placebo, p = 0.032, Figure 1).
Conclusion: Short-term administration of BQ-123 in patients undergo-

survival.

Introduction: Little has been known about clinical background of
the patients with heart failure (HF) and sleep disordered breathing
(SDB). The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship
between HF and SDB. Methods: 1121 patients admitted to our
institute with the diagnosis of HF between 2006 and 2012 was
enrolled. SDB was defined >5/h of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI).
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) group and central sleep apnea (CSA)
group were defined based on the data of type III sleep monitor
(Morpheus). Results: Among 1121 patients 328 (29%) underwent
screening of type III sleep monitor. In the 328 patients, 275 (84%)
patients showed SDB. Among these 275 SDB patients, 135 (41%)
were OSA, and 140 (43%) were CSA. AHI was significantly higher
(OSA: 22.5 + 16.2, CSA: 29.8 + 14.9, P< 0.05) and ejection fraction
(EF) was significantly lower (OSA: 40.1 + 17.1%, CSA: 33.5 + 14.1%,
P<0.05) in CSA group between two groups. Among 140 CSA
patients, 80 (57%) patients have heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction (HFREF) and among 135 OSA patients, 60 (44%) patients
have HFREF. Conclusions: SDB was highly associated with HF and the
clinical features between OSA and CSA with HF were different. CSA
patients were associated with lower EF and higher AHI than OSA
patients. This study suggested that SDB was one of an important
target of treatment HF and to treat HF according to these clinical
subsets of SDB was clinically required in the future.

Pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion (Murakoshi et al.,
2002; Kirkby et al., 2012) suggest that endothelin (ET) A-selective
antagonists are preferable to mixed ETA/B antagonists for prevention of
neointimal lesion formation. ETB receptors expressed in smooth muscle
cells may, however, contribute to lesion development. It was proposed
that ETB deletion from smooth muscle (SM) would reduce lesion
formation following arterial injury. Methods: Mice bearing a floxed ETB
gene or expressing cre-recombinase under the SM22 promoter were
crossed to produce SM-selective ETB deletion. SMETB knockout mice
were identified by genotyping and backcrossed to C57BI/6] (4-6
generations). Functional confirmation of ET deletion was determined
by exposing trachea, and mesenteric artery and vein, to sarafotoxin 6c
in a myograph. Femoral injury was performed in adult, male SMETB
knockout mice and littermate controls and arteries were harvested
33 days later for structural analysis. Results: SMETB knockout reduced
(~55%), but did not abolish, ETB-mediated contraction in trachea. In
contrast, S6c-mediated contraction in mesenteric veins (130 + 46%
KPSS, n = 4), and in mesenteric arteries cultured for 24h (72 + 24%
KPSS, n = 4), was abolished by SMETB deletion (5.1 + 3.4% KPSS and
0% KPSS, respectively). Femoral artery injury produced large, neointi-
mal lesions (47.4 + 10.6%; n = 7) but SMETB knockout did not alter
lesion size (42.2 + 4.5%; n = 9; P = 0.64). Conclusions: Stimulation of
ETB receptors in SM does not influence neointimal lesion formation.
This supports the suggestion that ETA-selective antagonists are
preferable to non-selective antagonists for prevention of neointimal
proliferation. The study was funded by the BHF (project grant and
CoRE). Murakoshi et al. (2002) Circulation 106:15; Kirkby et al. (2012)

Incubation of arteries ex vivo induces ETB-mediated contraction
(Adner et al., 1998), possibly via transcriptional mechanisms (Skovsted
et al., 2012). ETB receptors are also expressed in neointimal lesions
(Azuma et al., 1994). It was proposed that ETB-mediated contraction
would be induced by neointimal lesion formation. Methods: Femoral
arteries from adult, male C57BI/6J] mice (n = 6) were harvested 36 +/
— 2 days after ligation. Isolated mesenteric and femoral veins and
arteries from uninjured mice were cultured (DMEM; 37 °C; 5% CO3;
5 days) before analysis in a myograph. Contractile function was as-
sessed using phenylephrine (107 9-3 x 10-° M), endothelin-1 (107 '!-
10-’M) and sarafotoxin 6c (107 '!-10~’M). Relaxant function
was assessed using endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine; 107 °-3 x
107° M) and independent (sodium nitroprusside; 107 °-3 x 107 °M)
agents after contraction with phenylephrine. Results: Freshly isolated
mesenteric veins contracted in response to S6c whereas mesenteric
arteries and femoral veins did not. Some (4/10) femoral arteries
produced small S6c-induced contractions (21.86 +/— 3.72% KPSS,
