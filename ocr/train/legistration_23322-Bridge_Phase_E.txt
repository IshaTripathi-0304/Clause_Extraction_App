(COVID-19 EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 79)

Bridge Phase Order

WHEREAS, since early March 2020, Illinois has faced a pandemic that has caused extraordinary
sickness and loss of life, infecting over 1.35 million residents, and taking the lives of more than
22,000 residents; and,

WHEREAS, at all times but especially during a public health crisis, protecting the health and
safety of Illinoisans is among the most important functions of State government; and,

WHEREAS, social distancing, face coverings, and other public health precautions have proven
to be critical in slowing and stopping the spread of COVID-19; and,

WHEREAS, COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing COVID-19 disease, especially
severe illness and death; and,

WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC’’) recently updated its
guidance for fully vaccinated people,! indicating that they can resume numerous activities
without wearing a mask or staying 6 feet apart, except where required by federal, state, local,

and,

WHEREAS, the CDC continues to advise that cloth face coverings or masks protect persons

population that remains unvaccinated, I declared on April 30, 2021 that the current
circumstances in Illinois surrounding the spread of COVID-19 constitute an epidemic emergency

and a public health emergency under Section 4 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency
Act; and,

WHEREAS, the number of new COVID-19 cases has decreased in recent weeks, and the public
health metrics now allow for the State to relax some mitigation measures as more residents have
been vaccinated;

THEREFORE, by the powers vested in me as the Governor of the State of Illinois, pursuant to
the Illinois Constitution and Sections 7(1), 7(2), 7(3), 7(8), 7(9), and 7(12) of the Illinois
Emergency Management Agency Act, 20 ILCS 3305, and consistent with the powers in public
health laws, I hereby order the following, effective immediately:

Bridge Phase Order

1. Intent of this Executive Order. The intent of this Executive Order is to safely and
conscientiously, and in a manner consistent with CDC guidance, expand activities that
were limited during the prior mitigation Phases of the State’s response to the COVID-19
pandemic. This Executive Order supersedes Executive Order 2020-43, as amended by
Executive Orders 2020-55, 2020-59, and 2021-09.

2. Public health requirements for individuals. Individuals must take the following public
health steps to protect their own and their neighbors’ health and lives:

a. Social distancing. To the extent individuals who are not fully vaccinated are
using shared spaces when outside their residence, including when outdoors, they
must at all times and as much as reasonably possible maintain social distancing of
at least six feet from any other person who does not live with them.

b. Face coverings.” Any individual who is not fully vaccinated and who is over age
two and able to medically tolerate a face covering (a mask or cloth face covering)
shall be required to cover their nose and mouth with a face covering when in a
public place and unable to maintain a six-foot social distance. This requirement
applies whether in an indoor space, such as a store, or in a public outdoor space
where maintaining a six-foot social distance is not always possible.

All individuals, including those who are fully vaccinated, shall be required to
wear a face covering consistent with CDC guidance, including (1) on planes,
buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation and in transportation hubs
such as airports and train and bus stations; (2) in congregate facilities such as
correctional facilities and homeless shelters; and (3) in healthcare settings.

? Throughout this Executive Order, any reference to a face covering requirement excludes those two years old and
younger and those for whom wearing a face covering is not medically advisable. Guidance on use of face coverings
from the Illinois Department of Human Rights is available here:

Coverings During COVID-19_ Ver 202051 1b%20copy.pdf

----$$$$----$$$$----
Individuals in schools, day care settings, and educational institutions should
continue to follow separate guidance issued by the Illinois State Board of
Education, Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, and the Illinois
Department of Public Health.

c. Elderly people and those who are vulnerable as a result of illness should take
additional precautions. People who are not fully vaccinated and who are at high

risk of severe illness from COVID-19, including elderly people and those with a
health condition that may make them vulnerable, are urged to stay in their
residence and minimize in-person contact with others to the extent possible.

d. Gatherings. Because in-person contact presents the greatest risk of transmission
of COVID-19, Illinoisans who are not fully vaccinated are encouraged to continue
limiting in-person contact with others and to expand their social contact
cautiously. For residents who are not fully vaccinated, gathering remotely
continues to be the safest way to interact with those outside a household or
residence.

e. Go outdoors. Public health guidance suggests that the risks of transmission of
COVID-19 are greatly reduced outdoors as opposed to indoors. Where possible,
[llinoisans who are not fully vaccinated are encouraged to conduct their activities
outdoors.

3. Public health requirements for businesses, nonprofits, and other organizations. For
the purposes of this Executive Order, covered businesses include any for-profit, non-

profit, or educational entity, regardless of the nature of the service, the function it
performs, or its corporate or entity structure. Those entities must take the following
public health measures to protect their employees, their customers, and all others who
come into physical contact with their operations. Nothing in this Executive Order
prevents these entities from undertaking stricter or additional public health measures; to
the contrary, businesses are encouraged to prioritize the health and safety of their workers
and customers, and may continue to require face coverings and social distancing, even for
those who are fully vaccinated.

a. Requirements for all businesses. All businesses must:

e ensure that employees who are not fully vaccinated practice social
distancing and wear face coverings when social distancing 1s not always
possible;

e ensure that all spaces where employees may gather, including locker
rooms and lunchrooms, allow for social distancing; and

e ensure that all visitors (customers, vendors, etc.) to the workplace who
are not fully vaccinated can practice social distancing; but if maintaining

----$$$$----$$$$----
a six-foot social distance will not be possible at all times, encourage
those visitors to wear face coverings; and

e continue to take all necessary steps to protect employees and customers
by ensuring that any return to work plans adhere to all applicable public
health guidance.

The Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO), in
partnership with IDPH, has developed industry-specific guidance and toolkits to
help businesses operate safely and responsibly. These documents are available at:

industry-specific guidance 1s supplemented and updated by the “Bridge Phase”

customers and other employees at all times;

encouraged to serve food and beverages so that they may be consumed off-
premises, as permitted by law, through means such as in-house delivery, third-
party delivery, drive-through, and curbside pick-up. Establishments offering food
or beverages for on-premises consumption or for carry-out must ensure that they
have an environment where patrons who are not fully vaccinated maintain
adequate social distancing. All businesses covered in this section may permit
outdoor on-premises food and beverage consumption in accordance with DCEO
guidance and when permitted by local ordinances and regulations.

as spas, hair salons, barber shops, nail salons, waxing centers, tattoo parlors, and
similar facilities may be open but must comply with capacity limits in accordance

social distancing requirements for individuals who are not fully vaccinated.

Requirements for outdoor recreation, youth day camps, and youth sports.

Executive Order, social distancing includes maintaining at least six-foot distance from

other individuals, washing hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds as
