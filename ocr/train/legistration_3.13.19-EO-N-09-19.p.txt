EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT
STATE OF CALIFORNIA

Executive Order N-09-19

WHEREAS, California’s death penalty system is unfair, unjust, wasteful,
orotracted and does not make our state safer.

WHEREAS, the state’s bedrock responsibility to ensure equal justice under
the law applies to all people no matter their race, mental ability, wnere they
live, or how much money they have.

WHEREAS, death sentences are unevenly and unfairly applied to people
of color, people with mental disabilities, and people who cannot afford costly
legal representation.

WHEREAS, innocent people have been sentenced to death in
California. Moreover, the National Academy of Sciences estimates that as
many as one in 25 people sentenced to death in the United States is likely
innocent.

WHEREAS, since 1978, California has spent $5 billion on a death penalty
system that has executed 13 people.

WHEREAS, no person has been executed since 2006 because California's
execution protocols have not been lawful. Yet today, 25 California death row
inmates have exhausted all of their state and federal appeals and could be
eligible for an execution date.

WHEREAS, | will not oversee execution of any person while Governor.

NOW, THEREFORE, |, GAVIN NEWSOM, Governor of the State of California,
in accordance with the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes
of the State of California, do hereby issue the following order to become
effective immediately:

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

1. An executive moratorium on the death penalty shall be instituted in the
form of a reprieve for all people sentenced to death in California. This
moratorium does not provide for the release of any person from prison or
otherwise alter any current conviction or sentence.

2. California’s lethal injection protocol shall be repealed.

3. The Death Chamber at San Quentin shall be immediately closed in light of
the foregoing.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that as soon as hereafter possible, this Order shall
be filed with the Office of the Secretary of State and that widespread publicity
and notice shall be given to this Order.

----$$$$----$$$$----
This Order is not intended to, and does not, create any rights or benefits,
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, against the State of
California, its departments, agencies, or other entities, its officers or employees

or any other person.
