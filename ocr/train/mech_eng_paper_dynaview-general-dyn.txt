We present a general dynamic visualization model named DynaView to construct virtual scenes
of structural health monitoring (SHM) process. This model consists of static, dynamic, and
interaction submodels. It makes the visualization process dynamic and interactive. By taking an
example of a simplified reinforced concrete beam structure model, we obtain raw data through the
examination. We conduct the effective general and practicable assessment of structural damage
conditions based on fuzzy pattern recognition to compute the assessment results. We construct the
DynaView model of the sample structure and visualize it. The instance indicates that DynaView
model is efficient and practically applicable.

1. Introduction

The process of damage detection and identification for civil structure is called structural
health monitoring (SHM).SHM is the process of observing and collecting periodic sampling
data. Firstly, the SHM system analyzes those damage features that are abstracted from those
sampling data. Then it valuates current structure’s health state. SHM technology is a powerful
tool [1] to help ensure the safety of large and complicated civil infrastructures.

SHM of large structures has become a leading edge of civil engineering. It is very vital
for damage condition assessment to judge the structure’s working state and health state with
those sampling data. It is also important for engineers to recognize the damaged parts and
degree to assess the damage condition [2].

Besides the front-end intelligent monitoring and diagnosing function, the back-end
visualization function plays an important role within the whole SHM system. Visualization

----$$$$----$$$$----

output not only can reflect the monitoring and diagnostic technology but also can connect
the user and the system. Visualization allows one to display the structure state, safety alert,
intelligent assessment, and user feedback [3].

SHM visualization which is one of the most important components of SHM can
visualize the sampling data. It preprocess the data (including abstracting, filtering, and
analyzing), assesses the damage state, constructs the visualization model, and completes the
visual scene. It shows the damage conditions to users in a direct way.

SHM visualization is a critical bridge which connects the system and the user. On
one hand, SHM results can be displayed in the scene by visualization technology and alert
user directly. On the other hand, the visual scenes help users to confirm the correctness and
effectiveness of an SHM system.

At present, there are mainly three classes in the terms of visualization environment:
visual application environment, visual development environment, and visual software
environment. The first class is the visual application environment supported by application
software. It is always integrated into the system which can provide necessary data, model,
and visual method. The second class is the visual development environment supported by
some certain operating systems and development platforms. It takes good use of graphics
toolkits which are provided by some famous software, such as MATLAB, OpenGL, and
Open Inventor. The last class is visual software environment supported directly by some
visualization software just like AutoCAD, 3DMax, and Maya.

We present a dynamic and interactive visualization model named DynaView which
consists of static submodel, dynamic submodel, and interactive submodel. The static
submodel describes static features of structure. It is the visual mapping of the structure.
The dynamic submodel describes those constant changing dimensions or variables during
the whole SHM process. It is the kernel technology of dynamic visualization modeling. The
Interactive submodel provides the ability to interact with visual scenes which can respond
to time elapsing events, mouse and keyboard interaction. We preprocess the sampling data
and then assess the structure health state by using the effective and practicable assessment
of structural damage condition based on fuzzy pattern recognition. Lastly, we construct the
DynaView model to visualize the dynamic and interactive scenes by using VC6.0 and Open
Inventor. Users can directly perceive and master the instance structure’s health situation
through the visual scenes which can promote the safety of the structure.

2. Key Technologies in SHM Visual Modeling
2.1. VRML

Virtual reality modeling language (VRML) is a file format which can describe interactive
3D objects. In 1997, VRML was released as international standard by International Standard
Organization(ISO). Now it is called VRML97 which is authorized formally by ISO in 1998.
VRML files include space models and its nodes. The nodes describe model, color, light,
viewpoint, timer sensor, touch sensor, and interpolator and can locate the model’s position
and orientation. VRML describes 3D space using Scene Graph. Scene Graph is the inner pre-
sentation of VRML 3D spaces. The nodes construct the Scene Graph according to some certain
rules. Scene Graph looks like a reversed tree which has lots of root nodes. It is comprised of
node-attribute value. All the nodes are hierarchical and form a directed acyclic graph.
VRML provides Event-Route mechanism which is separated from hierarchical
structure. Event-Route mechanism can build a dynamic 3D virtual scene. Users can interact

----$$$$----$$$$----
Mathematical Problems in Engineering 3

with 3D scenes or change the state and attributes of 3D scenes. VRML ROUTE statement is
a special rule which provides the ability to change 3D scenes. It spreads the event from the
occurred node to the target node in order to change the latter’s state and attributes. Once
the event happens, it is immediately transmitted from the sending node to the receiving
node according to the ROUTE rule. The target node handles the event by updating state and
attributes, triggering another event or by changing the scene’s structure. ROUTE statements
always construct from EventOut to EventIn, while the type of both points must accurately
match each other.

2.2. Open Inventor

Open Inventor is a 3D interactive graphical toolkit developed by SGI. It uses OpenGL toolkit
as base platform and can precisely and quickly render VRML scenes. Open Inventor becomes
both a foundation and a superset of VRML. VRML is a subset of modified and enlarged Open
Inventor 3D graphic file format. Open Inventor is now the only 3D interactive graphical
toolkit which can support VRML nodes perfectly. The most important thing is that Open
Inventor supports ROUTE as well as the other nodes in VRML97. It provides attribute-
to-attribute method to save ROUTE statement with no information loss. The applications
developed based on Open Inventor can make good use of ROUTE statement to build dynamic
and interactive 3D virtual scene.

3. Dynamic Visual Modeling for SHM

In the engineering project, SHM system obtains the periodic sampling data through sensors.
In order to understand and analyze the computing results, we must display those important
data in a visual scene for better observation and interaction. The dynamic visualization
technology helps to describe continuous monitoring. The dynamic feature also helps users
to understand how the changing data have great influence on the whole structure [4]. Due to
more and more complicated civil structure, the dynamic characters need to be analyzed by
finite element and dynamic scene. It is very useful to dynamic analyzing the civil structures
by using modern graphic development environment and visualization technologies [5].
Therefore, it is of great importance and necessary to build a dynamic visual model to be
displayed in a visual scene.

SHM system is a kind of overall monitoring. Both static feature such as permanent
load and dynamic feature such as variable load are all monitored in time. Some abnormal
conditions at certain critical points of the civil structure are monitored by SHM system. Those
abnormal states are indicated by sampling feature data [2]. SHM dynamic visual modeling is
a complicated process: firstly, it abstracts, filters, and analyzes the periodic sampling data;
secondly, it assesses those computed data by using the assessment method of structural
damage condition; lastly, it maps those information into graphic elements by using the static
and dynamic models. The implied civil structure’s state information is shown by directly
perceived visual scenes.

3.1. Architecture of SHM System

The architecture of SHM system is shown as Figure 1 which is composed of Data Collection
Module, Data Preprocess Module, Structural Assessment Module, and Data Visualization

Module. The working flow of SHM system is as follows. As a first step, we obtain sampling
raw data through those sensors distributed on the structural key points. In the second
step, we save the sampling raw data and input them into the Data Preprocess Module to
abstract, filter, analyze, and process. Then, we standardize and output them to the Structural
Assessment Module. In the third step, we handle the standardized data and acquire the
structural health state by using the assessment of structural damage condition based on fuzzy
pattern recognition. After that, we output the state information to the Data Visualization
Module. For the last step, we build dynamic model and map it to visual scenes by using
the visualization engine. Users can observe and understand the civil structure’s health state
information and interact with the scene.

3.2. Structural Assessment Module of SHM System

The assessment of structural damage condition is used to solve four questions [1]. Firstly, the
module indicates whether the warning appears or not. Secondly, the module locates where
the damage appears. Thirdly, the module makes sure of the degree of the structural damage.
Lastly, the module gives the rest usable time of the damaged structure. Giraldo divides the
damage monitor and recognition into three classes [1]: method based on vibratory, method
based on static force, and method based on directly monitor. The Structural Assessment
Module gets the assessment attributes and results through valid and practicable computing.
The results are very important for the Data Visualization Module.

We use an effective general and practicable assessment of structural damage condition
based on fuzzy pattern recognition to change the structural state fuzzy variables into
a certainty question. The fuzzy variables are not limited by the state feature types.
The assessment method is based on both structural characters and prediction by fuzzy
professionals. It constructs structural fuzzy sets with overlap features. Without assuming
the probability distribution and density function of structural damage features, we can
entirely assess the damage state. When the civil structure is damaged, it causes the structural
attributes such as quality, rigidity, and damp coefficient changing constantly which leads
to the variation, of the structural natural frequency of vibration, mode of vibration and
impedance [1]. We assess the structural damage state by the approximation principle. We
also use fuzzy pattern recognition method to identify the coherence of similar objects and to
assure the attributes of the structural damage state fuzzy sets, state similarity matrix, and the
membership grade function.

The certification of attributes needs two steps as follows.

The first step is that we obtain the structural damage state fuzzy sets and state
similarity matrix. Assuming that . is the eigenvalue of structural state, the membership grade

----$$$$----$$$$----
Mathematical Problems in Engineering 5

function of structural damage state fuzzy sets using normal membership grade construction
function is as follows:

healthy state:
1 A <q,
H(A) = {caro L> An, (3.1)
little damage state:
uy(A) = eo (A-d)/o1)" LER, (3.2)
moderate damage state:
um(A) = e(G-Am)/omy yy ER (3.3)
severe damage state:
e((A-As)/05)" Vc Ne
\)=- ened 3.4
Hs (A) 1 Lode. (3.4)

Au, AL, 4m, Ag is the arithmetic mean value of four structural states’ eigenvalues. o1,
OL, Om, Os is the standard deviation of four eigen values. Based on the conception of structural
state overlap and damage accumulating, constructing the state similarity matrix SM is used to
reflect the degree of overlapping of the random two structural states. It is defined as follows:

SMpyy SMuy, SMum SMus
SMry SMrir SMim SMrs
SMuyu SMmut SMum SMms]-
SMsy SMs, SMsm SMsgs

SM = (3.5)

As for the matrix element SM_7, is the lattice degrees of nearness of two random state
fuzzy sets I and J. Its value varies from 0 to 1. The lattice degrees nearness of the same fuzzy
sets is 1.0. So, SM is a real symmetric matrix whose main diagonal elements are all 1.0. If SM
is assigned by the professionals, the value is decided by their experiences.

As for the second step, we obtain the attributes of the membership grade function.

Ay and o# of the structural state can be calculated from the undamaged sampling
data. Their values can be substituted into formula (3.1) and can confirm the function fy (A).
Before we confirm the other three structural damage state fuzzy sets and the membership
erade functions, we must get the values of Az, Aw, As, OL, Om and Os.

Assuming the discussing domain U = U; (overlap level of H and L), U2(overlap level
of H and M), U3(overlap level of H and S), U,(overlap level of L and S), Us(overlap level
of L and M), U¢(overlap Level of M and S)}, we get the value of the fuzzy subsets A from

----$$$$----$$$$----

the six elements of state similarity matrix. The professionals predict by experiments the fuzzy
subsets A’, A, and A’ are as follows:

SM, SMym SMuys SMim SMrs SMwms
A= 4 gp 5 = 5

uy u2 U3 U4 U5 U6

(3.6)

» fr po bs ba ps peo
A= — 4+ 4e 4 ER 4+ ; = [0,1]). ;
fini iat ue te (yu [ }) (3.7)

In the two formula, the sign SM7,/u; is not a concept of “fraction,” but a sigh which
means a degree of element A being a member of element u;. The sigh “+” is not a concept of
“addition,” but a sign which subs a kind of connection.

Assuming f is the European measurement of close degree of A and A’, we can solve
the formula (3.6) and formula (3.7) and get the solution of the six unknown attributes:

1 6 1/2
Max f=1-(75(a-4)") ; (3.8)
i=1

Mi <dt<dm<a
a Ms esr (3.9)

OL,OM,OS > 0.

The larger the value of the target function is, the closer A and A’ are. Inputting the
solution into formula (3.2), formula (3.3), and formula (3.4), we can obtain the other three
structural damage state fuzzy sets.

3.3. Data Visualization Module of SHM System
3.3.1. Framework of Data Visualization Module and Visual Workflow

The Data Visualization Module is as shown in Figure 2. Among the Data Visualization
Modules of SHM system, OpenGL graphic toolkit is at the lowest level. OpenGL is a 3D
interactive graphic toolkit developed by SGI Inc. It provides basic drawing graphic elements
and has the ability to parameterize the attributes. Above this level it is the Open Inventor
eraphic toolkit. Open Inventor is also a 3D interactive graphic toolkit developed by SGI Inc.
It uses OpenGL as the bottom rendering platform. Open Inventor is special in accurately
and quickly rendering the visual scene, especially the VRML scene. Between the user and
the toolkit, it is the dynamic interactive visualization model which is comprised of static
submodel, dynamic submodel, and interactive submodel. The static submodel describes
static features of structure. It is the visual mapping of the structure. The dynamic submodel
describes those constant changing dimensions or variables during the whole SHM process.
It is the kernel technology of dynamic visualization modeling. The Interactive submodel
provides the ability for users to interact with visual scenes which can response time elapse,
interactive mouse and interactive keyboard events. The user is on the top level of the
visualization model. The user can directly perceive and master the instant structure’s health
situation through the visual scene which can promote the safety of the structure. Moreover,
the user can deeply observe and judge the state by interactting with mouse and keyboard.

The kernel of Visual Workflow in SHM system is visual mapping, as shown in Figure 3.
There are three steps to complete the flow. In the first step, we input the preprocessed,
standardized, and assessed data into the visual model DynaView. The visual model can
map those data dimensions into the visual dimension. The critical step can produce the
static submodel and dynamic submodel. In the second step, the visual model can also map
the interactive information such as time lapse and interaction with mouse or keyboard into
the interaction submodel. In the third step, all of the information of the three submodels is
displayed in the visual scenes for users to examine and interact.

3.3.2. DynaView: Data Visualization Model of SHM System

OpenGL and Open Inventor is a real kind of mathematics state machine which can control the
basic graphical programming. They can handle lots of mathematics computing in graphical
problems. The developer and designer concentrate on how to build those visual scenes.

Although both OpenGL and Open Inventor provide the ability to produce lots of complicated
dynamic and interactive visual scenes, those toolkits themselves can only provide the method
or function of building and rendering the visual scenes. They do not provide the visualization
models in special domain. It is necessary for the SHM professionals to build a sophisticated
dynamic visual model to be fit for the SHM system.

DynaView, the Data Visualization Model of SHM System, is presented to solve the
problem we met. It is shown in Figure 4. Firstly, DynaView model maps the static data
dimensions to the basic elements of visual graphics such as cylinder, sphere, point, line,
and surface. The DynaView model also maps the data dimensions to the elements’ visual
dimensions such as material, color, brightness, angle, transparency, and height. All the basic
elements and their visual dimensions construct the static submodel. Secondly, DynaView
model connects the motoring and computing data with those basic elements and their visual
dimensions. The sampling data is changing with time lapse. All the assessed data derived
from the sampling data are also dynamic changing. All those data construct the dynamic
submodel. Lastly, DynaView model maps the user interactions into interactive model which
provides the ability to receive and handle the user’s interactive needs.

(1) Static submodel: input data of this model is preprocessed sampling data. The
submodel translates them into standardized modeling attributes. It abstracts the
geometrical characteristics and maps them into the basic visual elements. It also
builds the static visual scenes using visual dimensions such as points, lines and
surface. At the same time, the submodel maps the structural attributes into the basic
graphical elements’ visual dimensions with detailed information. The static visual
scenes are the visual mapping of the civil structures.

(2) Dynamic submodel: input data of this model is the preprocessed and assessed
changing data which can reflect the changing civil structures such as stress
and strain. In order to construct visual scenes, those data are changed into
standardized modeling attributes which can be mapped into basic visual elements
and their visual dimensions. Because the sampling data is constantly changing,
the standardized modeling attributes are dynamic data too. The DynaView model

maps the dynamic data to the TimeSensor nodes which is provided by the toolkit.
Those changing data make the scenes dynamic.

(3) Interactive submodel: input data of this model is the interactive event information
from mouse or keyboard. The model transmits the interactive event to the
TouchSensor nodes and ProximitySensor nodes which are provided by the toolkit.

The user interactivity can be responded in the visual scenes.

When the DynaView model is built, it also needs Open Inventor toolkit to render visual
scenes in the computer. The user can observe, translate, rotate, examine, and interact with the
visual scenes in the ExamineViewer which is provided by the toolkit. The user can also watch
the dynamic scenes on a regular Web Browser such as IE if the proper plugins are installed.
The user can directly realize current health state of the civil structure and can interact with
the visual scenes to get more information about the structure.

4. Experiments
4,1. Preprocess the Sampling Data

The experiment simulates that the reinforced concrete beam is pressed to concentrated load
on the center of beam during the course of pressing. The experiment is completed in the
Key Laboratory of Structural Engineering and Earthquake Resistance. As Figure 5 shows,
Figure 5(a) is the structure of beam. Figure 5(b) is the load of the beam. Figure 5(c) is the
distribution of testing point. The input parameters are as follows: f, is compressive strength
of concrete; fy, is the vertical steel area in the area of tensile; A, is the steel in the area of
tensile; fy is the vertical steel in the area of compression; A, is the steel area in the area of
compression. b and h are the broad and height cross-section.

The experiment simulates load on the center of beam’s changing when every test point
is pressed. The value of deflection and strain is concerned. All the experimental data are listed
in Tables 1 and 2. Under the condition, the warning value of deflection and stain is 13.5 mm
the former and 1550ye the latter. When the load is changing from zero to 34.657 KN, the
values from 5 test point are recorded into the two tables. From the data, it is concluded that
the value of deflection never exceeds the warning value, though the value of strain starts to
over the warning value when the load is bigger than 29.889 KN.

The formula o = Ee < fy, can compute the section’s reinforcement stress value. E in
the formula is a constant, and E = 2.1 x 10° (Unit: N/mm7), while fy is a constant too, and
fy = 310 KN. The sampling data such as deflection and stress are obtained in the experiment.
Substituting both the two constants’ value into the formula, we can get the value of the stress
o. Comparing the value with yield strength f,, it is concluded that if the compared value
is between 30% and 40%, the values are normal. The users must pay great attention to the
abnormal values in case of the unexpected accidents.

4,2. Assessment of Structural Damage State

The experimental structure is shown in Figure 5. There are the arithmetic mean value and
standard deviation of four structural states’ eigen values in Table 3. The eigen values of three
recognizing damage states are shown in Table 4. The lattice degrees of nearness with random
state fuzzy sets of three recognizing damage states are shown in Table 5. All the data indicate
that the assessment of structural damage condition based on fuzzy pattern recognition is
effective and practicable.

4.3. Dynamic Visualization of the Experimental Structure

The experimental structure is shown in Figure 5. According to the experiment’s structure, the
preprocessing data, and the assessment information, we can build the dynamic model for the
example structure.

(1) The example static submodel: the experimental structure is a simplified reinforced
concrete beam. We map the beam’s structure into the graphical elements with Open
Inventor hierarchical nodes to create the static submodel. As shown in Figure 6, a
simple virtual beam is in the visual scene which is organized as a tree inside.

----$$$$----$$$$----

Figure 6: Static model of the experimental structure.

Figure 7: Dynamic model of the experimental structure.

(2) The example dynamic submodel: according to the assessed information and

damage state, we build the dynamic submodel. The various information and the
changing state can also be mapped into the graphical elements with Open Inventor
hierarchical nodes. Especially, the midspan load of the experimental structure is
from one side to another. Its values change consciously with the characteristic
of instantaneity. So we map the time lapse event into the TimeSensor node and
complete the scene with ROUTE statement to get the dynamic scenes. As shown in
Figure 7, a simple virtual dynamic visual scene which is organized as a tree inside
is properly built.

(3) The example interactive submodel: the experiment considers some simple user

interaction such as dragging the load object (e.g., a car or something) from one side
to the other side. Dragging interaction can be a direct and subjective operation for
the users to get more information about the health state. The interactive submodel
obtain the user’s interactive event and handle it. After the interaction, the next scene
is built. The events are mapped into the TouchSensor node or another sensor node
with Open Inventor toolkit and ROUTE statement. As shown in Figure 8, a simple
interactive visual scene which is organized as a tree inside is properly built.

We build DynaView model of the experimental structure, including the static

submodel, the dynamic submodel, and the interactive submodel with the development
environment VC++6.0 and Open Inventor toolkit. In fact, DynaView Model is a visual scene

tree constructed by Open Inventor nodes. Users can observe the visual scenes in the inbuilt
browser provided by Open Inventor. Users can directly examine and interact with the scenes,
paying more attention to the structural damage state at any time.

5. Conclusion

A general and dynamic visualization model named DynaView is proposed. This model
consists of static submodel, dynamic submodel, and interaction submodel. The raw data
is from sampling monitoring data. The assessment method is an effective general and
practicable assessment of structural damage condition based on fuzzy pattern recognition.
We built virtual scenes with DynaView model and Open Inventor toolkit in VC++6.0. We
implement the dynamic and interactive visual display in SHM system. Using the DynaView
Model, users can directly examine and interact with the virtual scenes. User also can
reconstruct the dynamic process of inner or outside changing on the structure. Although the
experimental structure is a simplified reinforced concrete beam, the DynaView model is the
base of handling complicated and large structure such as large bridge and large building. In
the future, DynaView model also can provide more and more interactive ability for users to
analyze the health states.
