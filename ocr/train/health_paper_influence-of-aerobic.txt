Introduction

ABSTRACT

Given that few studies have examined the interaction between endocrine-inflammatory mediators and
aerobic exercise training in hypertensive postmenopausal women, the aim of this study was to inves-
tigate whether aerobic exercise training (AET) for twenty-four sessions would alter cortisol, leptin and
interleukin-18 (IL-18) levels. To further analyze endothelium function in response to AET, we also
examined redox state as well as NO/cGMP pathway in this population. Eighteen hypertensive post-
menopausal women finished this study. AET program consisted of 24 sessions in treadmill, 3 times per
week, duration of 30 up to 40 min for each session, for 8 weeks at intensity of 100% of the MLSS ac-
cording to previous incremental test. Heart rate was monitored in all studied time (resting and during
exercise sessions). After 48 h of the last exercise session, blood samples were collected for biochemical
analyses (levels of cortisol, leptin, IL-1f, nitrite/nitrate (NOx), cGMP, malondialdehyde (MDA) and
asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA); superoxide and catalase activity). We also measured systolic and
diastolic blood pressure. A significant reduction in body mass was observed. As expected, systolic and
diastolic blood pressure values were significantly reduced after AET in hypertensive women. We also
found a marked increase in NOx” levels as well as cGMP concentration in trained women, approximately
37.7 and 30.8%, respectively. No changes in cortisol, leptin, ADMA and IL-1B levels were observed after
AET. Similarly, MDA levels and catalase activity were not affected by AET. In contrast, a marked increase
in SOD activity was found (86.6%). In conclusion, our findings show that aerobic exercise training for
twenty-four sessions promoted a significant reduction in blood pressure by activating NO/cGMP pathway
as well as by promoting an up-regulation of SOD activity without changing in cortisol/leptin levels in
postmenopausal hypertensive women.

explains the increased incidence of CVD since hormone replacement
therapy did not prevent or mitigated cardiovascular events in this
population [3,4]. Oxidative stress is another explanation, where
increased production of the inflammatory mediators would lead to a
massive production of reactive oxygen species, which in turn,
resulting in endothelium dysfunction with decrease in nitric oxide
(NO) production or its bioavailability to the cells [5]. However, some
studies found a positive association between CVD and inflammatory
mediators |6—8| whereas others failed to detect any association | 9}
in climacteric phase. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis has
also been linked to the higher incidence of CVD in postmenopausal
women | 10,11 |. Nevertheless, the number of studies examining the
interaction between menopause status and glucocorticoids is scarce.

Therefore, the higher incidence of CVD in postmenopausal women
still a complex issue and further studies should be carried out to look
at the insight mechanisms as well as to get more information in an
attempt to prevent cardiovascular events in this population. On the
other hand, a plethora of studies has shown that physically active
subjects have more longevity with reduction of morbidity and
mortality [12,13]. Given that few studies have examined the inter-
action between endocrine-inflammatory mediators and aerobic ex-
ercise training in hypertensive postmenopausal women, the aim of
this study was to investigate whether aerobic exercise training for
twenty-four sessions would alter cortisol, leptin and interleukin-18
levels. To further analyze endothelium function in response to ex-
ercise training, we also examined redox state as well as NO/cGMP
pathway in this population.

Methodology
Study participants

This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Institute of
Bioscience at the University of Sdo Paulo State (UNESP). All the vol-
unteers were recruited through advertisements in the surrounding
area of UNESP. A total of thirty-two volunteers were eligible to
participate in the study. After all screening test, only eighteen women
finished the study. Postmenopausal status was determined as the
absence of menstruation for at least 1 year under natural or surgical
causes were Classified as hypertensive according to previous medical
diagnosis (systolic blood pressure: 140—159 mm Hg, diastolic blood
pressure: 90—99 mm Hg or using anti-hypertensive). The inclusion
criteria of this study were: to be hypertensive; body mass index
<30 kg/m; sedentary (<150 min of moderate physical activity per
week or <60 min of vigorous physical activity per week). The
exclusion criteria were: smoking, taking hormone replacement
therapy, diabetic, cardiovascular disease (stroke, heart failure); renal
dysfunction; other condition that precludes the practice of physical
exercise. Before starting the protocol, volunteers were informed
about the procedures and risks of the study and signed a consent
form in accordance with Ethical Committee of UNESP.

Study protocol

This clinical trial lasted 10 weeks and all parameters were
evaluated at initial time and after 24 sessions of the aerobic ex-
ercise training (AET). Initially, the anthropometric and cardio-
vascular parameters were measured and volunteers were
familiarized to the treadmill during 2—4 days, depending upon

each participant. After familiarization, maximal lactate steady
state (MLSS) was defined individually for prescription of AET in-
tensity. Briefly, postmenopausal women performed two to five
tests with fixed duration (30 min) and walking speed (5.5 km/h)
on a treadmill (Movement RT 250 PRO) in accordance with pre-
vious study [14]. The inclination of the ergometer was used to
control the intensity that ranged between 1 and 15%. The intensity
was adjusted in each test according to the aerobic capacity of the
participant. Measurement blood lactate concentration was per-
formed at rest, 10th and 30th min during incremental test. MLSS
was determined when the difference of blood lactate concentra-
tion between 10th and 30th min was not exceeded 1 mM [15].

AET program consisted of 24 sessions in treadmill, 3 times per
week, duration of 30 up to 40 min for each session, for 8 weeks. The
intensity of the AET was 100% of the MLSS according to previous
incremental test. Heart rate was monitored and AET was supervised
by exercise physiologists in an environmental with temperature
(= 25 °C) and humidity (40—60%) controlled. Figure 1 illustrates the
experimental design.

Anthropometric parameters

Body weight and height was determined using a scale and sta-
diometer (Toledo 2096 PP). Body mass index was calculated as the
ratio body weight divided by the square of the height in meters.
Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint between the
last rib and iliac crest.

Cardiovascular parameters

Blood pressure (BP) — After 20 min of sitting position, three
consecutives BP measurements using a semi-automatic equipment
(Microlife MIB-P3BTOA). Resting BP was determined as the average
of the measurements.

Heart rate (HR) — HR was measured using a heart rate monitor
(Polar FT1 TRQ) after 20 min of seated position. At the final of the
resting period the value of HR was obtained.

Blood samples

Blood samples were collected after 12 h of overnight fast
(between 7:00 and 8:00 am). Blood samples were collected from
the antecubital vein using standard venipuncture methods.
Samples were centrifuged (3000 rpm, 12 min) and the superna-
tant (plasma and serum) were stored in aliquots at —80 °C for
future analysis.

Biochemical analyses

Lipid profile and glycemia — Serum concentrations of total
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, very low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, tri-
glycerides and glycemia were determined using automated standard
method (Cobas Mira Plus).

Cortisol — Serum concentrations of cortisol were measured by
the chemiluminescence (ADVIA Centaur®). This is a competitive
immunoassay that uses direct chemiluminescent technology.

Leptin — Serum leptin concentrations were measured by ELISA
using a commercial available kit (SPI Bio, Montigny-le-Bretonneux,
France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Interleukin-16 (IL-18) and guanosine cyclic monophosphate
(cGMP) — Plasma concentrations of IL-18 and cGMP were measured
by ELISA using a commercial available kit (R&D Systems, Mine-
apolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) — Plasma concentrations of
ADMA were measured by ELISA using a commercial available kit
(Immunodiagnostik AG, Bensheim, Germany) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions.

Nitrite/Nitrate (NO, ) — Plasma concentrations of NOx were
measured to evaluate NO production by commercial available kit
(Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Before starting this assay samples were ultra-
filtered through micro filter (Microcon Centrifugal Filter Units,
10 kDa, Millipore, Bedford, MA).

Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and malondialdehyde (MDA) —
All these markers were measured by ELISA using a commercial avail-
able kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. SOD’s assay detects radicals superoxide
generated by xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine, revealing the plas-
matic activity of this enzyme. Catalase’s assay is based on the reaction
of the enzyme with methanol in an optimal H202 concentration. Serum
levels of MDA were determined to evaluate lipid peroxidation | 16].

Statistical analysis

Data are presented as mean + standard error mean. Normality of
the data was verified by the Kolmogorov—Smirnov’s test. A paired
Student’s t-test was used to analyze the effect of AET on the car-
diometabolic and endocrine parameters. For all analyses, P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Results

Body mass index values were significantly reduced in hyperten-
sive postmenopausal women after 24 sessions of AET approximately
1.5% as compared to initial time. However, no changes were found in
waist circumference, lipid profile and glycemia. On the other hand,
the intensity of physical exercise employed in our study was effective
to promote a significant increase in MLSS after AET, approximately
32.7%. Data are summarized in Table 1. Regarding antihypertensive
therapy, 67% of the participants were on renin-angiotensin inhibitors
or AT1 receptor blockers whereas six volunteers were on diuretics or
beta-adrenergic receptor blocker therapy (33%). Regarding hypo-
lipidemic compound, 50% of the volunteers were on therapy previ-
ously to the study.

As expected, AET was effective in lowering arterial blood pres-
sure in trained HT women, approximately —3.8% and —5.9% for
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively (Figure 2, panels
A and B). Resting heart rate values were also decreased after 24

sessions of aerobic physical exercise (Table 1 and Figure 2C). Given
that it is well established that the health beneficial effect of the ex-
ercise training is related to activation of NO/cGMP signaling pathway,
we have evaluated these biomarkers before and after twenty-four
sessions of aerobic physical exercise. We found a marked increase
in NOx” levels, which reflect NO production, as well as cGMP con-
centration in trained women, approximately 37.7 and 30.8%,
respectively (Figure 3, panels A and B). Interestingly, we found no
changes in ADMA levels (Figure 3C).

Furthermore, we also analyzed the redox state by measuring SOD
and catalase activities and MDA concentration. Our findings show
that AET promoted a profound increase in SOD activity, approxi-
mately 86.6% (Figure 4A). No changes were found catalase activity
and MDA concentration (Figure 4, panels B and C).

Regarding endocrine-inflammatory mediators, we found no ef-
fects of the AET on cortisol, leptin and IL-1 levels in postmenopausal
hypertensive women (Figure 5, panels A, B and C, respectively).
Interestingly, we found a positive relationship between systolic blood

pressure values and cortisol levels at initial time of the study
(17 = 0.2422, P < 0.0448, n = 17, Figure GA) whereas this correlation
was abrogated after AET (P > 0.05, Figure 6B).

Discussion

A number of studies have shown that cardiovascular diseases can
be prevented by regular physical exercise either in human or in
laboratory animals, which is strongly associated with an increase in
NO bioavailability {17—19]. Regarding postmenopausal women,
recent study found that aerobic exercise training even in a low in-
tensity promoted reductions in blood pressure showing how
changing in the lifestyle is favorable for this particular population in
preventing cardiovascular events [20]. However, no mechanist

events have been reported. Thus, one of the objectives of our study is
to examine different pathways that regulate blood pressure in
response to exercise training in hypertensive postmenopausal
women. We found that twenty-four sessions of aerobic physical
exercise was effective in reducing BMI as well as to improve the
physical capacity of all volunteers. Additionally, the reductions of
systolic and diastolic blood pressure were positively associated with
an improvement of NO/cGMP pathway as well as an up-regulation of
SOD activity. Taken together, these findings show that aerobic ex-
ercise training promoted an improvement of endothelium function
in hypertensive postmenopausal women. Indeed, previous studies
from our group have systematically demonstrated the beneficial
effects of the exercise training on cardiovascular system by increased
production of NO and/or its bioavailability in postmenopausal
women |21—24]. To further examine the association between NO

inhibition and hypertension in postmenopausal women, we looked
at ADMA levels since evidences have linked increased ADMA levels
in patients with angina, arterial hypertension and immune
dysfunction mainly in elderly and postmenopausal women |25—27].
We found no changes in ADMA levels in trained women excluding
the contribution of this endothelial pathway on the beneficial effects
of exercise training in blood pressure regulation. In contrast, two
recent studies from the same group showed a decrease in plasma
ADMA in healthy postmenopausal women in response to aerobic
exercise training as well as an inverse relationship between aerobic
fitness and levels of ADMA [28,29]. However, these studies did not
measure NO production, and blood pressure values were not
modified by exercise training. Thus, more studies should be carried
out to check the contribution of the endogenous inhibition of NO
availability on arterial hypertension as well as the effects of exercise
training on ADMA/NOS pathway.

Increased oxidative stress has been pointed out to play an
important in the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension in men |30|
as well as in postmenopausal women [5,31]. Although evidences
have demonstrated that trained [32] or physically active healthy
postmenopausal women [33] showed a decreased in circulating
concentrations of MDA as compared to sedentary one, no blood
pressure measurements were performed in these studies. Thus, the
data do not clarify the high incidence of arterial hypertension in
postmenopausal women or explain the insight mechanisms in the
phenomenon. In our study, we found no changes in MDA levels in
response to exercise training in hypertensive postmenopausal
women excluding the contribution of this biomarker in the bene-
ficial effects of physical exercise on blood pressure regulation. We
also found no changes in the pro-inflammatory mediators, IL-18
and leptin, in response to exercise training. It has been reported the
influence of estrogen on pro- and anti-inflammatory pathway in
different cells types [34]. Indeed, in whole human blood cultures,
the addition of different concentration of estrogen decreases
secretion of several pro-inflammatory mediators, mainly IL-1 [35].
Additionally, it has been demonstrated an increase in inflammatory
mediators in experimental model of menopause [36]. Interestingly,
a previous study showed that IL-1 levels increase in the early stage
of the menopause (less than five years) and return to the normal
levels in the late stage, with values similar to premenopause phase
[8|. Thus, it is not clear whether estrogen deficiency could lead to an
inflammatory state in postmenopausal women. Furthermore, the
range of concentration of IL-1B levels in women is very wide
varying between 0.30 and 0.081 pg/mL depending on the repro-
ductive phase or not as well as the time after menopause [37].
Regarding leptin levels and postmenopausal women, the interac-
tion is even more complex [38]. An increase [39], no variation |40|
and a decrease [41,42] in circulating leptin levels were detected
after menopause. Previous studies reported that postmenopausal
women under caloric restriction [43] or on tibolone therapy |42|
showed a significant reduction in leptin levels. In our study, exer-
cise training did not affect leptin levels even though there was a
slight reduction in the BMI (1.5%). Indeed, previous studies have
shown that changes in leptin levels are detected only when physical
training is associated with caloric restriction in postmenopausal
women [44,45].

A number of studies have shown the importance of cortisol, the
major glucocorticoid hormone produced in human, in elevating
blood pressure |46—48]. Several signaling pathways seem to be
involved in the mechanisms by which cortisol produces arterial hy-
pertension including sodium/volume homeostasis, activation of the
renin-angiotensin system, and increased sympathetic drive |49—52].
Additionally, it has been reported that cortisol impairs NO production
measured by NOx” levels attributing thus, the cortisol-induced hy-
pertension to the NO deficiency in both human and experimental

model [53,54]. However, most of the studies have examined the
interaction between cortisol and arterial hypertension in male sub-
jects [55] and no one examined the effects of exercise training on
endocrine-inflammatory mediators in hypertensive postmenopausal
women. In our study, we found no effects of the exercise training in
the cortisol concentration in hypertensive postmenopausal women.
Thus, it is clear that the beneficial effects of exercise training on blood
pressure were related to an improvement of NO/cGMP pathway
without changing in serum cortisol levels. This is confirmed by the
lack of positive correlation between cortisol and blood pressure after
twenty-four sessions of exercise. Collectively, our findings show that
the endocrine-inflammatory mediators: cortisol, leptin and IL-1 did
not contribute to the beneficial effects of the exercise training on
blood pressure in hypertensive postmenopausal women. Further-
more, our study confirms that aerobic exercise training for twenty-
four sessions promoted a reduction in blood pressure by activating
NO/cGMP pathway as well as by promoting an up-regulation of SOD
in this particular population.
